Although reinforcement learning (RL)\noffers a proactive approach through agents that learn optimal runtime\nadaptation policies, it requires extensive simulation. Furthermore, predictive\nmachine learning models face online distribution and concept drift that\nminimize their accuracy. We propose a three-step solution to the proactive edge\nstream processing autoscaling problem. Firstly, a GRU neural network forecasts\nthe upstream load using real-world and synthetic DSP datasets. Secondly, a\ntransfer learning framework integrates the predictive model into an online\nstream processing system using the DTW algorithm and joint distribution\nadaptation to handle the disparities between offline and online domains.\nFinally, a horizontal autoscaling module dynamically adjusts the degree of\noperator parallelism, based on predicted load while considering edge resource\nconstraints. The lightweight GRU model for load predictions recorded up to\n1.3\\% SMAPE value on a real-world data set. It outperformed CNN, ARIMA, and\nProphet on the SMAPE and RMSE evaluation metrics, with lower training time than\nthe computationally intensive RL models."}

Deploying large models closer to\nthe data and users has become a key research area to address these issues.\nHowever, applying these models directly often entails significant difficulties,\nsuch as model mismatching, resource constraints, and energy inefficiency.\nAutomated design of customized models is necessary, but it faces three key\nchallenges, namely, the high cost of centralized model customization,\nimbalanced performance from user heterogeneity, and suboptimal performance from\ndata heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose ACME, an adaptive customization\napproach of Transformer-based large models via distributed systems. To avoid\nthe low cost-efficiency of centralized methods, ACME employs a bidirectional\nsingle-loop distributed system to progressively achieve fine-grained\ncollaborative model customization. In order to better match user heterogeneity,\nit begins by customizing the backbone generation and identifying the Pareto\nFront under model size constraints to ensure optimal resource utilization.\nSubsequently, it performs header generation and refines the model using data\ndistribution-based personalized architecture aggregation to match data\nheterogeneity.

For more complex data sharing scenarios,\nwhere consent might not be sufficient, many parties rely on contracts. Before a\ncontract is signed, it must undergo the process of contract negotiation within\nthe contract lifecycle, which consists of negotiating the obligations\nassociated with the contract. Contract compliance verification (CCV) provides a\nmeans to verify whether a contract is GDPR-compliant, i.e., adheres to legal\nobligations and there are no violations. The rise of knowledge graph (KG)\nadoption, enabling semantic interoperability using well-defined semantics,\nallows CCV to be applied on KGs. In the scenario of different participants\nnegotiating obligations, there is a need for data consistency to ensure that\nCCV is done correctly. Recent work introduced the automated contracting tool\n(ACT), a KG-based and ODRL-employing tool for GDPR CCV, which was developed in\nthe Horizon 2020 project smashHit (https://smashhit.eu). Although the tool\nreports violations with respect to obligations, it had limitations in verifying\nand ensuring compliance, as it did not use an interoperable semantic formalism,\nsuch as SHACL, and did not support users in resolving data inconsistencies. In\nthis work, we propose a novel approach to overcome these limitations of ACT. We\nsemi-automatically resolve CCV inconsistencies by providing repair strategies,\nwhich automatically propose (optimal) solutions to the user to re-establish\ndata consistency and thereby support them in managing GDPR-compliant contract\nlifecycle data. We have implemented the approach, integrated it into ACT and\ntested its correctness and performance against basic CCV consistency\nrequirements."}

As LLM agents are increasingly\ndeployed on open blockchain platforms, multi-agent systems capable of\ntolerating malicious (Byzantine) agents have become essential.\n  Recent Byzantine-robust multi-agent systems typically rely on leader-driven\ncoordination, which suffers from two major drawbacks. First, they are\ninherently vulnerable to targeted attacks against the leader. If consecutive\nleaders behave maliciously, the system repeatedly fails to achieve consensus,\nforcing new consensus rounds, which is particularly costly given the high\nlatency of LLM invocations. Second, an underperforming proposal from the leader\ncan be accepted as the final answer even when higher-quality alternatives are\navailable, as existing methods finalize the leader's proposal once it receives\na quorum of votes.\n  To address these issues, we propose DecentLLMs, a novel decentralized\nconsensus approach for multi-agent LLM systems, where worker agents generate\nanswers concurrently and evaluator agents independently score and rank these\nanswers to select the best available one. This decentralized architecture\nenables faster consensus despite the presence of Byzantine agents and\nconsistently selects higher-quality answers through Byzantine-robust\naggregation techniques.\n  Experimental results demonstrate that DecentLLMs effectively tolerates\nByzantine agents and significantly improves the quality of selected answers."}

The simulations revealed that both boron and carbon\ndissociated from their host Ti atoms to achieve energetically favored ordering\nwith Cr, Mo, and Nb. Boron clusters formed as B2, surrounded by Mo, Nb, and Cr,\nwhile carbon preferentially clustered with Cr to form a Cr23C6 local motif and\nwith Nb to form Nb2C. Distinct preferences for interstitial sites were\nobserved, with boron favoring tetrahedral sites and carbon occupying octahedral\nsites. In the presence of a vacancy, B2 shifted from the tetrahedral site to\nthe vacancy, where it remained coordinated with Mo, Nb, and Cr. Similarly,\ncarbon utilized vacancies to form Nb2C clusters. Excess energy calculations\nshowed that B and C exhibited strong thermodynamic stability within their\nshort-range ordered configurations. However, under Ti-rich conditions, C was\nmore likely to segregate into TiC, despite preexisting ordering with Cr. This\nshift in stability suggests that increased Ti availability would alter carbide\nformation pathways, drawing C away from Cr-rich networks and promoting the\ndevelopment of TiC. Such redistribution may disrupt the continuity of Cr-based\ncarbide networks, which play a critical role in stabilizing grain boundaries\nand impeding crack propagation. These effects further underscore the impact of\ninterstitial-induced ordering on phase stability and microstructural evolution.\nThis work provides an atomistic perspective on how boron- and carbon-induced\nordering influences microstructure and mechanical properties.

In an infinite-wavelength setting, this effect gives rise to bound\nstates in the continuum, where a photon remains confined in between the\nemitter. In the case of a finite-length waveguide with two periodic boundary\nconditions, the relevant distances become two, leading to states in which a\nphoton is confined in either the shorter or the longer path that connects the\nemitters.

However, conventional MARL-based ride-sharing\napproaches heavily rely on the accurate estimation of Q-values or V-values,\nwhich becomes problematic in large-scale, highly uncertain environments.\nSpecifically, most of these approaches adopt an independent paradigm,\nexacerbating this issue, as each agent treats others as part of the\nenvironment, leading to unstable training and substantial estimation bias in\nvalue functions. To address these challenges, we propose two novel alternative\nmethods that bypass value function estimation. First, we adapt GRPO to\nride-sharing, replacing the PPO baseline with the group average reward to\neliminate critic estimation errors and reduce training bias. Second, inspired\nby GRPO's full utilization of group reward information, we customize the PPO\nframework for ride-sharing platforms and show that, under a homogeneous fleet,\nthe optimal policy can be trained using only one-step rewards - a method we\nterm One-Step Policy Optimization (OSPO).

Often, this uncertainty\narises from multiple sources, e.g., incomplete information, limited\ncomputation, bounded rationality. While it may be possible to guide the agents'\ndecisions by modeling each source, their joint presence makes this task\nparticularly daunting. Toward this goal, it is natural for agents to seek\nprotection against deviations around the emergent behavior itself, which is\nultimately impacted by all the above sources of uncertainty. To do so, we\npropose that each agent takes decisions in face of the worst-case behavior\ncontained in an ambiguity set of tunable size, centered at the emergent\nbehavior so implicitly defined. This gives rise to a novel equilibrium notion,\nwhich we call strategically robust equilibrium. Building on its definition, we\nshow that, when judiciously operationalized via optimal transport,\nstrategically robust equilibria (i) are guaranteed to exist under the same\nassumptions required for Nash equilibria; (ii) interpolate between Nash and\nsecurity strategies; (iii) come at no additional computational cost compared to\nNash equilibria.

This paper addresses these issues by introducing a novel\nmultimodal federated learning-based approach for news recommendation. First, it\nintegrates both textual and visual features of news items using a multimodal\nmodel, enabling a more comprehensive representation of content. Second, it\nemploys a time-aware model that balances users' long-term and short-term\ninterests through multi-head self-attention networks, improving recommendation\naccuracy. Finally, to enhance privacy, a federated learning framework is\nimplemented, enabling collaborative model training without sharing user data.\nThe framework divides the recommendation model into a large server-maintained\nnews model and a lightweight user model shared between the server and clients.\nThe client requests news representations (vectors) and a user model from the\ncentral server, then computes gradients with user local data, and finally sends\ntheir locally computed gradients to the server for aggregation. The central\nserver aggregates gradients to update the global user model and news model. The\nupdated news model is further used to infer news representation by the server.\nTo further safeguard user privacy, a secure aggregation algorithm based on\nShamir's secret sharing is employed. Experiments on a real-world news dataset\ndemonstrate strong performance compared to existing systems, representing a\nsignificant advancement in privacy-preserving personalized news recommendation."}

When the leader\nfails, the service must elect a new leader to continue processing requests,\nduring which the service experiences an out-of-service (OTS) time. The OTS time\nis directly influenced by election parameters, such as heartbeat interval and\nelection timeout.

It improves the decomposition quality, at the cost of increasing\nmemory usage and complicating training. Unlike these works, we introduce a\ndiscretized SDF to represent the continuous SDF in a discrete manner by\nencoding it within each Gaussian using a sampled value.

Several deep learning-based models have been developed to\nidentify such users. These models should not only accurately detect bad actors,\nbut also be robust against adversarial attacks that aim to evade detection.\nHowever, past deep learning-based detection models do not meet the robustness\nrequirement because they are sensitive to even minor changes in the input\nsequence. To address this issue, we focus on (1) improving the model\nunderstanding capability and (2) enhancing the model knowledge such that the\nmodel can recognize potential input modifications when making predictions. To\nachieve these goals, we create a novel transformer-based classification model,\ncalled ROBAD (RObust adversary-aware local-global attended Bad Actor Detection\nmodel), which uses the sequence of user posts to generate user embedding to\ndetect bad actors. Particularly, ROBAD first leverages the transformer encoder\nblock to encode each post bidirectionally, thus building a post embedding to\ncapture the local information at the post level. Next, it adopts the\ntransformer decoder block to model the sequential pattern in the post\nembeddings by using the attention mechanism, which generates the sequence\nembedding to obtain the global information at the sequence level. Finally, to\nenrich the knowledge of the model, embeddings of modified sequences by mimicked\nattackers are fed into a contrastive-learning-enhanced classification layer for\nsequence prediction. In essence, by capturing the local and global information\n(i.e., the post and sequence information) and leveraging the mimicked behaviors\nof bad actors in training, ROBAD can be robust to adversarial attacks.\nExtensive experiments on Yelp and Wikipedia datasets show that ROBAD can\neffectively detect bad actors when under state-of-the-art adversarial attacks."}

It builds on the idea presented by Chen~\\emph{et al}.~[Phys. Rev. Appl.\n{\\bf 19}, 054209 (2023)], who proposed zero-added-loss multiplexing (ZALM) as a\nmeans for high-fidelity, quasi-deterministic entanglement generation.\nUnfortunately, Chen \\emph{et al}.'s ZALM requires a large number (800) of\nspectral channels to achieve its claimed high-fidelity, quasi-deterministic,\nhigh-rate entanglement generation. Our modified version of ZALM affords major\nperformance improvements over the original. It draws on Morrison~\\emph{et\nal}.~[APL Photon. {\\bf 7}, 066102 (2022)], who domain engineered a $\\chi^{(2)}$\ncrystal to realize a biphoton wave function with 8 discrete and\nspectrally-factorable frequency bins. Our ZALM SPDCs each have a modest number\n($N_I\\ll$ 800) of these phase-matched spectral islands each generating two-mode\nsqueezed-vacuum states, permitting our analysis, unlike Chen~\\emph{et al.}'s,\nto account for multipairs of all orders, losses in the partial BSM, and\npropagation losses en route to the receivers. A major innovation in our\nproposal is to employ both same-island heralding and cross-island heralding,\nwhich allows the entanglement-delivery rate to scale as $N_I^2$ rather than\n$N_I$ in the weak squeezing regime required for the reception of photon pairs\nwith a high Bell-state fidelity under realistic losses. This heralding scheme\nuses an order of magnitude fewer spectral channels, which may enable near-term\nimplementations of satellite-to-ground or fiber-optic based ZALM architectures."}

Simple parallel grippers often struggle with such tasks due to\nlimited dexterity and actuation constraints.

This paper\nintroduces FedStrategist, a novel meta-learning framework that reframes robust\naggregation as a real-time, cost-aware control problem. We design a lightweight\ncontextual bandit agent that dynamically selects the optimal aggregation rule\nfrom an arsenal of defenses based on real-time diagnostic metrics.

We show that our adaptive agent successfully learns\nsuperior policies across diverse scenarios, including a ``Krum-favorable\"\nenvironment and against a sophisticated \"stealth\" adversary designed to\nneutralize specific diagnostic signals. Critically, we analyze the paradoxical\nscenario where a non-robust baseline achieves high but compromised accuracy,\nand demonstrate that our agent learns a conservative policy to prioritize model\nintegrity. Furthermore, we prove the agent's policy is controllable via a\nsingle \"risk tolerance\" parameter, allowing practitioners to explicitly manage\nthe trade-off between performance and security.

In this paper, we\npropose a new KV cache optimization paradigm called LaCache, a training-free\nmethod for efficient and accurate generative inference of LLMs. LaCache enables\nLLMs to simultaneously address both of the critical challenges in long-range\nmodeling: robust long-range capabilities and continuous generation without\nrunning out-of-memory (OOM). Specifically, LaCache integrates two key\ninnovations: (1) a ladder-shaped KV cache pattern that stores KV pairs not only\nsequentially (left-to-right within each layer) but also across layers (from\nshallow to deep), providing an extended span for capturing long-range\ndependencies under a fixed storage budget, thereby boosting long-range\ncapabilities; and (2) an iterative compaction mechanism that progressively\ncompresses older caches, freeing up space for new tokens within a fixed cache\nsize.

We\nconsider stealthy attacks that subtly manipulate offline-collected data to\ndestabilize the resulting closed-loop system while evading detection. To\ngenerate such perturbations, we propose the Directed Gradient Sign Method\n(DGSM) and its iterative variant (I-DGSM), adaptations of the fast gradient\nsign method originally developed for neural networks, which align perturbations\nwith the gradient of the spectral radius of the closed-loop matrix to reduce\nstability. A key contribution is an efficient gradient computation technique\nbased on implicit differentiation through the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of\nthe underlying semidefinite program, enabling scalable and exact gradient\nevaluation without repeated optimization computations. To defend against these\nattacks, we propose two defense strategies: a regularization-based approach\nthat enhances robustness by suppressing controller sensitivity to data\nperturbations and a robust data-driven control approach that guarantees\nclosed-loop stability within bounded perturbation sets. Extensive numerical\nexperiments on benchmark systems show that adversarial perturbations with\nmagnitudes up to ten times smaller than random noise can destabilize\ncontrollers trained on corrupted data and that the proposed defense strategies\neffectively mitigate attack success rates while maintaining control\nperformance.

Existing methods fail to fully capture and balance the global\nand local features within the samples, resulting in limited synthetic data\nquality. Moreover, we have found that during inference, there is a significant\ndifference in the distributions of intermediate layer activations between the\nquantized and full-precision models. These issues lead to a severe performance\ndegradation of the quantized model. To address these problems, we propose a\npipeline for Data-Free Quantization for Vision Transformers (DFQ-ViT).\nSpecifically, we synthesize samples in order of increasing difficulty,\neffectively enhancing the quality of synthetic data. During the calibration and\ninference stage, we introduce the activation correction matrix for the\nquantized model to align the intermediate layer activations with those of the\nfull-precision model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DFQ-ViT achieves\nremarkable superiority over existing DFQ methods and its performance is on par\nwith models quantized through real data. For example, the performance of DeiT-T\nwith 3-bit weights quantization is 4.29% higher than the state-of-the-art. Our\nmethod eliminates the need for fine-tuning, which not only reduces\ncomputational overhead but also lowers the deployment barriers for edge\ndevices. This characteristic aligns with the principles of Green Learning by\nimproving energy efficiency and facilitating real-world applications in\nresource-constrained environments."}

A data-driven\nmodel was trained on 5,097 experimental samples covering a range of magnetic\nfield magnitudes (0-14 mT), actuation frequencies (0.2-1.0 Hz), and vertical\ntip distances (90-100 mm), using both Neural Network (NN) and Random Forest\n(RF) architectures. The RF model outperformed the NN across all metrics,\nachieving a mean root mean square error of 0.087 mm in control point prediction\nand a mean shape reconstruction error of 0.064 mm. Feature importance analysis\nfurther revealed that magnetic field components predominantly influence distal\ncontrol points, while frequency and distance affect the base configuration.\nThis learning-based approach effectively models the complex nonlinear behavior\nof hyperelastic soft robots under magnetic actuation without relying on\nsimplified physical assumptions.

This hybrid framework preserves the\nsymbolic interpretability of HDC while enabling task-adaptive representation\nlearning. Experiments on Apnea-ECG and PTB-XL demonstrate that our model\nsignificantly outperforms traditional HDC and classical ML baselines, achieving\n73.09\\% precision and an F1 score of 0.626 on Apnea-ECG, with comparable\nrobustness on PTB-XL. Our framework offers an efficient and scalable solution\nfor edge-compatible ECG classification, with strong potential for interpretable\nand personalized health monitoring."}

To imitate this cognitive ability\nin urban autonomous driving while ensuring the transparency and\ninterpretability, we propose a vision-language model (VLM)-enhanced unified\ndecision-making and motion control framework, named VLM-UDMC. This framework\nincorporates scene reasoning and risk-aware insights into an upper-level slow\nsystem, which dynamically reconfigures the optimal motion planning for the\ndownstream fast system. The reconfiguration is based on real-time environmental\nchanges, which are encoded through context-aware potential functions. More\nspecifically, the upper-level slow system employs a two-step reasoning policy\nwith Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), leveraging foundation models to\nprocess multimodal inputs and retrieve contextual knowledge, thereby generating\nrisk-aware insights. Meanwhile, a lightweight multi-kernel decomposed LSTM\nprovides real-time trajectory predictions for heterogeneous traffic\nparticipants by extracting smoother trend representations for short-horizon\ntrajectory prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed VLM-UDMC framework is\nverified via both simulations and real-world experiments with a full-size\nautonomous vehicle.

Very recent advances have enabled flight in such conditions, but\nthey either rely on constant motion through the pipe to mitigate airflow\nrecirculation effects or suffer from limited stability during hovering. In this\nwork, we present the first closed-loop control system for quadrotors for\nhovering in narrow pipes that leverages real-time flow field measurements. We\ndevelop a low-latency, event-based smoke velocimetry method that estimates\nlocal airflow at high temporal resolution. This flow information is used by a\ndisturbance estimator based on a recurrent convolutional neural network, which\ninfers force and torque disturbances in real time. The estimated disturbances\nare integrated into a learning-based controller trained via reinforcement\nlearning. The flow-feedback control proves particularly effective during\nlateral translation maneuvers in the pipe cross-section. There, the real-time\ndisturbance information enables the controller to effectively counteract\ntransient aerodynamic effects, thereby preventing collisions with the pipe\nwall. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first\ndemonstration of an aerial robot with closed-loop control informed by real-time\nflow field measurements.

This paper presents an analysis of simple test-time\nscaling and finds that the scaling behavior is largely attributed to scaling\ndown by enforcing a maximum length. In contrast, fine-tuning on long CoT data\ndistilled from o1-like models has no significant impact on scaling behavior,\nand scaling up by appending \"Wait\" leads to inconsistencies, as the model may\noscillate between solutions. A key distinction exists between scaling down by\nenforcing a maximum length and scaling up test-time compute in o1-like models,\nsuch as DeepSeek-R1\\@. These models are typically allowed to utilize as much\ncompute as needed, with the only constraint being the model's maximum supported\nlength. By learning to naturally scale up test-time compute during\nreinforcement learning, o1-like models surpass their peak performance when\nscaling up. In contrast, simple test-time scaling progressively imposes a lower\nupper limit on model performance as it scales down.

In this context, Ultra-wideband (UWB) radar is capable of penetrating\nthrough such challenging environmental conditions due to the lower frequency\ncomponents within its broad bandwidth. Therefore, UWB radar has emerged as a\npotential sensing technology for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)\nin vision-denied environments where optical sensors (e.g. LiDAR, Camera) are\nprone to failure. Existing approaches involving UWB radar as the primary\nexteroceptive sensor generally extract features in the environment, which are\nlater initialized as landmarks in a map. However, these methods are constrained\nby the number of distinguishable features in the environment. Hence, this paper\nproposes a novel method incorporating UWB Angle of Arrival (AOA) measurements\ninto UWB radar-based SLAM systems to improve the accuracy and scalability of\nSLAM in feature-deficient environments. The AOA measurements are obtained using\nUWB anchor-tag units which are dynamically deployed by the robot in featureless\nareas during mapping of the environment. This paper thoroughly discusses\nprevailing constraints associated with UWB AOA measurement units and presents\nsolutions to overcome them. Our experimental results show that integrating UWB\nAOA units with UWB radar enables SLAM in vision-denied feature-deficient\nenvironments."}

To make structured predictions for node\nlabels, we propose ReDiSC, namely, Reparameterized masked Diffusion model for\nStructured node Classification. ReDiSC estimates the joint distribution of node\nlabels using a reparameterized masked diffusion model, which is learned through\nthe variational expectation-maximization (EM) framework.

FMCW radar utilizes a\ncontinuous chirp, while IR-UWB radar employs short pulses. Our mm-wave FMCW\nradar operated at 60 GHz with a 5.5 GHz bandwidth (2.7 cm resolution, 3\nreceiving antennas [Rx]), and our IR-UWB radar at 8 GHz with a 500 MHz\nbandwidth (30 cm resolution, 2 Rx). Using a novel 2D+1D ResNet architecture we\nachieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.85 bpm and a mean absolute percentage\nerror (MAPE) of 1.42% for heart rate monitoring with FMCW radar (N=119\nparticipants, an average of 8 hours per participant). This model maintained\nperformance (under 5 MAE/10% MAPE) across various body positions and heart rate\nranges, with a 98.9% recall. We then fine-tuned a variant of this model,\ntrained on single-antenna and single-range bin FMCW data, using a small (N=376,\navg 6 minutes per participant) IR-UWB dataset. This transfer learning approach\nyielded a model with MAE 4.1 bpm and MAPE 6.3% (97.5% recall), a 25% MAE\nreduction over the IR-UWB baseline. This demonstration of transfer learning\nbetween radar systems for heart rate monitoring has the potential to accelerate\nits introduction into existing consumer devices."}

Multiple kiwifruit detachment mechanisms were\ndesigned and field testing of one of the concepts showed that the mechanism\ncould reliably pick kiwifruit. Furthermore, this kiwifruit detachment mechanism\nwas able to reach over 80 percent of fruit in the cluttered kiwifruit canopy,\nwhereas the previous state of the art mechanism was only able to reach less\nthan 70 percent of the fruit. Artificial pollination was performed by detecting\nflowers and then spraying pollen in solution onto the detected flowers from a\nline of sprayers on a boom, while driving at up to 1.4 ms-1. In addition, the\nheight of the canopy was measured and the spray boom was moved up and down to\nkeep the boom close enough to the flowers for the spray to reach the flowers,\nwhile minimising collisions with the canopy. Mobile robot navigation was\nperformed using a 2D lidar in apple orchards and vineyards. Lidar navigation in\nkiwifruit orchards was more challenging because the pergola structure only\nprovides a small amount of data for the direction of rows, compared to the\namount of data from the overhead canopy, the undulating ground and other\nobjects in the orchards. Multiple methods are presented here for extracting\nstructure defining features from 3D lidar data in kiwifruit orchards. In\naddition, a 3D lidar navigation system -- which performed row following, row\nend detection and row end turns -- was tested for over 30 km of autonomous\ndriving in kiwifruit orchards. Computer vision algorithms for row detection and\nrow following were also tested. The computer vision algorithm worked as well as\nthe 3D lidar row following method in testing."}

To\naddress this, we introduce the Causal Action Influence Score (CAIS), a novel\nintrinsic reward rooted in causal inference. CAIS quantifies an action's\ninfluence by measuring the 1-Wasserstein distance between the learned\ndistribution of sensory outcomes conditional on that action, $p(h|a)$, and the\nbaseline outcome distribution, $p(h)$. This divergence provides a robust reward\nthat isolates the agent's causal impact from confounding environmental noise.\nWe test our approach in a simulated infant-mobile environment where\ncorrelation-based perceptual rewards fail completely when the mobile is\nsubjected to external forces. In stark contrast, CAIS enables the agent to\nfilter this noise, identify its influence, and learn the correct policy.\nFurthermore, the high-quality predictive model learned for CAIS allows our\nagent, when augmented with a surprise signal, to successfully reproduce the\n\"extinction burst\" phenomenon.

Most of the alloys with high solvus temperature have\nhigher gamma prime coarsening resistance, while the larger lattice misfit is\nattributed to higher gamma prime coarsening rate. In this work, we explore the\ninfluence of Co on the microstructure evolution, thermophysical/mechanical\nproperties and gamma prime precipitate coarsening kinetics in a Ti-rich\nNi-Co-Cr-Al-Ti based alloy. More specifically, we focus on the effect of\npartitioning of Co into the gamma matrix on the redistribution of other solutes\nacross the interface. We observe a significant increase in the coarsening\nresistance and a twofold increase in the activation energy with the increase in\nthe Co composition from 10at.%Co to 30at.%Co, even though the gamma prime\nsolvus reduces by 75C. As otherwise, a higher solvus, usually, indicates better\nmicrostructural stability at high temperatures. We employed a combined\nexperimental and theoretical approach by atom probe tomography (APT) and\nCALPHAD simulations to probe the critical role of Co partitioning to gamma\nmatrix on the solute transport in the gamma matrix and flux across the\ngamma/gamma prime interfaces, which is found to control the overall gamma prime\ncoarsening behavior in the alloy.

Batching allows managers to trade off cost and\nprocessing effort against waiting time. Larger and less frequent batches may\nlower costs by reducing processing effort and amortizing fixed costs, but they\ncreate longer waiting times. In contrast, smaller and more frequent batches\nreduce waiting times but increase fixed costs and processing effort. A batching\npolicy defines how activity instances are grouped into batches and when each\nbatch is activated. This paper addresses the problem of discovering batching\npolicies that strike optimal trade-offs between waiting time, processing\neffort, and cost. The paper proposes a Pareto optimization approach that starts\nfrom a given set (possibly empty) of activity batching policies and generates\nalternative policies for each batched activity via intervention heuristics.\nEach heuristic identifies an opportunity to improve an activity's batching\npolicy with respect to a metric (waiting time, processing time, cost, or\nresource utilization) and an associated adjustment to the activity's batching\npolicy (the intervention). The impact of each intervention is evaluated via\nsimulation. The intervention heuristics are embedded in an optimization\nmeta-heuristic that triggers interventions to iteratively update the Pareto\nfront of the interventions identified so far. The paper considers three\nmeta-heuristics: hill-climbing, simulated annealing, and reinforcement\nlearning. An experimental evaluation compares the proposed approach based on\nintervention heuristics against the same (non-heuristic guided) meta-heuristics\nbaseline regarding convergence, diversity, and cycle time gain of\nPareto-optimal policies."}

The mission-critical and\ntime-sensitive nature of these applications necessitates the design of\nlow-latency FL frameworks that guarantee high learning performance. In\npractice, achieving low-latency FL faces two challenges: the overhead of\ncomputing and transmitting high-dimensional model updates, and the\nheterogeneity in communication-and-computation (C$^2$) capabilities across\ndevices. To address these challenges, we propose a novel C$^2$-aware framework\nfor optimal batch-size control that minimizes end-to-end (E2E) learning latency\nwhile ensuring convergence. The framework is designed to balance a fundamental\nC$^2$ tradeoff as revealed through convergence analysis. Specifically,\nincreasing batch sizes improves the accuracy of gradient estimation in FL and\nthus reduces the number of communication rounds required for convergence, but\nresults in higher per-round latency, and vice versa. The associated problem of\nlatency minimization is intractable; however, we solve it by designing an\naccurate and tractable surrogate for convergence speed, with parameters fitted\nto real data.

We explore both\ntransient and equilibrium regimes and compare the performance of Gaussian and\nnon-Gaussian probe states for temperature estimation. In the non-equilibrium\nregime, we show that single-mode non-Gaussian probe states - such as Fock, odd\ncat, and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states - can significantly enhance the speed\nof estimation, particularly at short interaction times. In the two-mode\nsetting, entangled states such as the two-mode squeezed vacuum, NOON state, and\nentangled cat state can enable access to temperature information at much\nearlier times. In the equilibrium regime, we analyze temperature estimation\nusing two-mode squeezed thermal states, which outperform single-mode\nstrategies. We evaluate practical measurements and find that both energy and\npopulation difference observables yield optimal precision, while\nquadrature-based measurements are suboptimal. The precision gain arises from\nsqueezing, which suppresses fluctuations in the population difference."}

How many beamformers are needed to achieve the best\nperformance for both sensing and communications? This paper establishes bounds\non the minimum number of downlink beamformers, in which sensing performance is\nmeasured in terms of the Cram\\'{e}r-Rao bound for parameter estimation and\ncommunications performance is measured in terms of the\nsignal-to-interference-and-noise ratios. We show that an ISAC system requires\nat most $K + \\sqrt{\\frac{L(L+1)}{2}}$ beamformers if the remote users have the\nability to cancel the interference caused by the sensing beams. If cancelling\ninterference due to the sensing beams is not possible, the bound becomes\n$\\sqrt{K^2 + \\frac{L(L+1)}{2}}$. Interestingly, in the latter case, the bound\non the number of beamformers is less than the sum of the bounds for each task\nindividually.

Existing\nsolutions mostly rely on manual discovery, which is inefficient, costly to\nmaintain, and difficult to scale. Recent research uses large language models\n(LLMs) to explore new Gas waste patterns. However, it struggles to remain\ncompatible with existing patterns, often produces redundant patterns, and\nrequires manual validation/rewriting. To address this gap, we present GasAgent,\nthe first multi-agent system for smart contract Gas optimization that combines\ncompatibility with existing patterns and automated discovery/validation of new\npatterns, enabling end-to-end optimization. GasAgent consists of four\nspecialized agents, Seeker, Innovator, Executor, and Manager, that collaborate\nin a closed loop to identify, validate, and apply Gas-saving improvements.\nExperiments on 100 verified real-world contracts demonstrate that GasAgent\nsuccessfully optimizes 82 contracts, achieving an average deployment Gas\nsavings of 9.97%. In addition, our evaluation confirms its compatibility with\nexisting tools and validates the effectiveness of each module through ablation\nstudies. To assess broader usability, we further evaluate 500 contracts\ngenerated by five representative LLMs across 10 categories and find that\nGasAgent optimizes 79.8% of them, with deployment Gas savings ranging from\n4.79% to 13.93%, showing its usability as the optimization layer for\nLLM-assisted smart contract development."}

To address this, we introduce CXR-TFT, a novel multi-modal\nframework that integrates temporally sparse CXR imaging and radiology reports\nwith high-frequency clinical data, such as vital signs, laboratory values, and\nrespiratory flow sheets, to predict the trajectory of CXR findings in\ncritically ill patients.

In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-aware enhancement\nframework for DETR-based object detectors. We model bounding boxes as\nmultivariate Gaussian distributions and incorporate the Gromov-Wasserstein\ndistance into the loss function to better align the predicted and ground-truth\ndistributions. Building on this, we derive a Bayes Risk formulation to filter\nhigh-risk information and improve detection reliability. We also propose a\nsimple algorithm to quantify localization uncertainty via confidence intervals.\nExperiments on the COCO benchmark show that our method can be effectively\nintegrated into existing DETR variants, enhancing their performance.

This enables a step-by-step reduction\nof the superposition until the target state can be measured with certainty. The\nalgorithm achieves deterministic success with a query complexity of\n$O(N^{\\log_2(3)/2}) \\approx O(N^{0.7925})$, falling between Grover's\n$O(\\sqrt{N})$ scaling and the classical $O(N)$. Our approach relies exclusively\non two-qubit nearest-neighbour diffusion operators, avoiding global diffusion\nentirely. We show that, despite the increased query complexity, this design\nreduces the total number of two-qubit gates required for diffusion by more than\nan order of magnitude for search spaces up to at least 18 qubits, with even\ngreater advantages on hardware with limited qubit connectivity.

We also identify an\nentropy-reward tradeoff: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may\nprogressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet\nunderrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while\nRLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally\noutweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets,\nfailing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base\nmodel. Interestingly, we also observe that while RLVR sometimes increases\ntoken-level entropy, resulting in greater uncertainty at each generation step,\nanswer-level entropy declines, indicating that these seemingly more uncertain\npaths ultimately converge onto a smaller set of distinct answers. Taken\ntogether, these findings reveal potential limits of RLVR in extending reasoning\nhorizons. Breaking this invisible leash may require future algorithmic\ninnovations such as explicit exploration mechanisms or hybrid strategies that\nseed probability mass into underrepresented solution regions."}

Thus, integrating an unspoken thought\nprocess into SLMs is highly desirable. While naively generating a complete\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before starting to talk can enable thinking\nfor SLMs, this induces additional latency for the speech response, as the CoT\nreasoning can be arbitrarily long. To solve this issue, we propose Stitch, a\nnovel generation method that alternates between the generation of unspoken\nreasoning chunks and spoken response chunks. Since the audio duration of a\nchunk of spoken response is much longer than the time to generate the tokens in\na chunk of spoken response, we use the remaining free time to generate the\nunspoken reasoning tokens. When a chunk of audio is played to the user, the\nmodel continues to generate the next unspoken reasoning chunk, achieving\nsimultaneous thinking and talking. Remarkably, Stitch matches the latency of\nbaselines that cannot generate unspoken CoT by design while outperforming those\nbaselines by 15% on math reasoning datasets; Stitch also performs equally well\non non-reasoning datasets as those baseline models.

In the training phase, we propose an axis-aligned\ngeometric constraint to enhance document dewarping. In the inference phase, we\npropose an axis alignment preprocessing strategy to reduce the dewarping\ndifficulty. In the evaluation phase, we introduce a new metric, Axis-Aligned\nDistortion (AAD), that not only incorporates geometric meaning and aligns with\nhuman visual perception but also demonstrates greater robustness. As a result,\nour method achieves SOTA results on multiple existing benchmarks and achieves\n18.2%~34.5% improvements on the AAD metric."}

The heterogeneity in these data\nand the diverse insight of investors introduce biases that complicate the\nmodeling of market dynamics.

Through\nempirical analysis on real-world financial datasets, we uncover a dynamic\nrelationship between bias variation and behavioral adaptation, which enhances\ntrend prediction under evolving market conditions. To model this mechanism, we\npropose the Bias to Behavior from Bull-Bear Dynamics model (B4), a unified\nframework that jointly embeds temporal price sequences and external contextual\nsignals into a shared latent space where opposing bull and bear forces\nnaturally emerge, forming the foundation for bias representation. Within this\nspace, an inertial pairing module pairs temporally adjacent samples to preserve\nmomentum, while the dual competition mechanism contrasts bullish and bearish\nembeddings to capture behavioral divergence.

Specifically, LaCache integrates two key\ninnovations: (1) a ladder-shaped KV cache pattern that stores KV pairs not only\nsequentially (left-to-right within each layer) but also across layers (from\nshallow to deep), providing an extended span for capturing long-range\ndependencies under a fixed storage budget, thereby boosting long-range\ncapabilities; and (2) an iterative compaction mechanism that progressively\ncompresses older caches, freeing up space for new tokens within a fixed cache\nsize. This token distance-based dynamic compression enables more effective\ncontinuous generation under constrained cache budgets.

We introduce Unary Feedback as Observation (UFO) for reinforcement\nlearning, which uses minimal yet common unary user feedback during iterative\nproblem solving. It can be easily applied to existing single-turn RL training\nsetups. Experimental results show that RL training with UFO keeps single-turn\nperformance and improves multi-turn reasoning accuracy by up to 14%, enabling\nlanguage models to better react to feedback in multi-turn problem solving. To\nfurther minimize the number of turns needed for a correct answer while\nencouraging diverse reasoning when mistakes occur, we design reward structures\nthat guide models to produce careful and deliberate answers in each turn.

This study presents a theoretical and empirical\ninvestigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of RLVR.\nFirst, we offer a new theoretical perspective that RLVR is constrained by the\nbase model's support-unable to sample solutions with zero initial\nprobability-and operates as a conservative reweighting mechanism that may\nrestrict the discovery of entirely original solutions. We also identify an\nentropy-reward tradeoff: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may\nprogressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet\nunderrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while\nRLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally\noutweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets,\nfailing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base\nmodel.

This paper presents an analysis of simple test-time\nscaling and finds that the scaling behavior is largely attributed to scaling\ndown by enforcing a maximum length. In contrast, fine-tuning on long CoT data\ndistilled from o1-like models has no significant impact on scaling behavior,\nand scaling up by appending \"Wait\" leads to inconsistencies, as the model may\noscillate between solutions. A key distinction exists between scaling down by\nenforcing a maximum length and scaling up test-time compute in o1-like models,\nsuch as DeepSeek-R1\\@.

The SM method combines the\ncomputational efficiency of EM single-physics simulations with the precision of\nmultiphysics simulations. The shared coarse model is based on EM single-physics\nresponses corresponding to various nontunable design parameters values.\nConversely, the fine model is implemented to delineate the behavior of\nmultiphysics responses concerning both nontunable and tunable design parameter\nvalues. The proposed overall surrogate model comprises multiple subsurrogate\nmodels, each consisting of one shared coarse model and two distinct mapping\nneural networks. The responses from the shared coarse model in the EM\nsingle-physics filed offer a suitable approximation for the fine responses in\nthe multiphysics filed, whereas the mapping neural networks facilitate\ntransition from the EM single-physics field to the multiphysics field. Each\nsubsurrogate model maintains consistent nontunable design parameter values but\npossesses unique tunable design parameter values. By developing multiple\nsubsurrogate models, optimization can be simultaneously performed for each\ntuning state. Nontunable design parameter values are constrained by all tuning\nstates, whereas tunable design parameter values are confined to their\nrespective tuning states. This optimization technique simultaneously accounts\nfor all the tuning states to fulfill the necessary multiple tuning state\nrequirements.

Compared with existing direct\nmultiphysics parameterized modeling techniques, our proposed method achieves\nsuperior multiphysics modeling accuracy with fewer training samples and reduced\ncomputational costs."}

To address this, we introduce CXR-TFT, a novel multi-modal\nframework that integrates temporally sparse CXR imaging and radiology reports\nwith high-frequency clinical data, such as vital signs, laboratory values, and\nrespiratory flow sheets, to predict the trajectory of CXR findings in\ncritically ill patients.

In a\nretrospective study of 20,000 ICU patients, CXR-TFT demonstrated high accuracy\nin forecasting abnormal CXR findings up to 12 hours before they became\nradiographically evident.

We introduce\nStableAnimator++, the first ID-preserving video diffusion framework with\nlearnable pose alignment, capable of generating high-quality videos conditioned\non a reference image and a pose sequence without any post-processing. Building\nupon a video diffusion model, StableAnimator++ contains carefully designed\nmodules for both training and inference, striving for identity consistency. In\nparticular, StableAnimator++ first uses learnable layers to predict the\nsimilarity transformation matrices between the reference image and the driven\nposes via injecting guidance from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). These\nmatrices align the driven poses with the reference image, mitigating\nmisalignment to a great extent. StableAnimator++ then computes image and face\nembeddings using off-the-shelf encoders, refining the face embeddings via a\nglobal content-aware Face Encoder.

To address this gap, we propose\ncollaboration between a reasoning model and a human expert who resolves queries\nthe model cannot confidently answer. We find that quantifying the uncertainty\nof a reasoning model through the length of its reasoning trace yields an\neffective basis for deferral to a human, e.g., cutting the error rate of Qwen3\n235B-A22B on difficult MATH problems from 3% to less than 1% when deferring\n7.5% of queries. However, the high latency of reasoning models still makes them\nchallenging to deploy on use cases with high query volume. To address this\nchallenge, we explore fronting a reasoning model with a large non-reasoning\nmodel. We call this modified human-in-the-loop system \"Fail Fast, or Ask\",\nsince the non-reasoning model may defer difficult queries to the human expert\ndirectly (\"failing fast\"), without incurring the reasoning model's higher\nlatency.

In particular,\nresearchers are increasingly fascinated by harnessing the power of generative\nAI to automate the discovery of novel analog circuit topologies. Unlocking the\nfull potential of generative AI in these data-driven discoveries requires\naccess to large and diverse datasets.Yet, there is a significant barrier in the\nanalog domain--Analog circuit design is inherently proprietary, involving not\nonly confidential circuit structures but also the underlying commercial\nsemiconductor processes. As a result, current generative AI research is largely\nconfined to individual researchers who construct small, narrowly focused\nprivate datasets. This fragmentation severely limits collaborative innovation\nand impedes progress across the research community. To address these\nchallenges, we propose AnalogFed. AnalogFed enables collaborative topology\ndiscovery across decentralized clients (e.g., individual researchers or\ninstitutions) without requiring the sharing of raw private data. To make this\nvision practical, we introduce a suite of techniques tailored to the unique\nchallenges of applying FedL in analog design--from generative model development\nand data heterogeneity handling to privacy-preserving strategies that ensure\nboth flexibility and security for circuit designers and semiconductor\nmanufacturers.

The\napplication to inverse rendering still faces several challenges, as the\ndiscrete nature of Gaussian primitives makes it difficult to apply geometry\nconstraints. Recent works introduce the signed distance field (SDF) as an extra\ncontinuous representation to regularize the geometry defined by Gaussian\nprimitives. It improves the decomposition quality, at the cost of increasing\nmemory usage and complicating training. Unlike these works, we introduce a\ndiscretized SDF to represent the continuous SDF in a discrete manner by\nencoding it within each Gaussian using a sampled value. This approach allows us\nto link the SDF with the Gaussian opacity through an SDF-to-opacity\ntransformation, enabling rendering the SDF via splatting and avoiding the\ncomputational cost of ray marching.The key challenge is to regularize the\ndiscrete samples to be consistent with the underlying SDF, as the discrete\nrepresentation can hardly apply the gradient-based constraints (\\eg Eikonal\nloss). For this, we project Gaussians onto the zero-level set of SDF and\nenforce alignment with the surface from splatting, namely a projection-based\nconsistency loss.

Through SOI transition\nheatmaps and dataset cartography visualization, we analyze how examples shift\nbetween these categories when transitioning from single-setting to\nmulti-setting configurations.

However, traditional PNR systems face several\nchallenges, including an overreliance on textual content, common neglect of\nshort-term user interests, and significant privacy concerns due to centralized\ndata storage. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a novel\nmultimodal federated learning-based approach for news recommendation. First, it\nintegrates both textual and visual features of news items using a multimodal\nmodel, enabling a more comprehensive representation of content. Second, it\nemploys a time-aware model that balances users' long-term and short-term\ninterests through multi-head self-attention networks, improving recommendation\naccuracy. Finally, to enhance privacy, a federated learning framework is\nimplemented, enabling collaborative model training without sharing user data.\nThe framework divides the recommendation model into a large server-maintained\nnews model and a lightweight user model shared between the server and clients.\nThe client requests news representations (vectors) and a user model from the\ncentral server, then computes gradients with user local data, and finally sends\ntheir locally computed gradients to the server for aggregation. The central\nserver aggregates gradients to update the global user model and news model. The\nupdated news model is further used to infer news representation by the server.\nTo further safeguard user privacy, a secure aggregation algorithm based on\nShamir's secret sharing is employed. Experiments on a real-world news dataset\ndemonstrate strong performance compared to existing systems, representing a\nsignificant advancement in privacy-preserving personalized news recommendation."}

A consortium comprising GMV GmbH, Saarland\nUniversity, and Thales Alenia Space collaborates to develop AI-driven\nalgorithms and demonstrates their effectiveness over traditional methods for\ntwo crucial operational challenges: data routing and resource allocation. In\nthe routing use case, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used to improve the\nend-to-end latency by learning from historical queuing latency, outperforming\nclassical shortest path algorithms. For resource allocation, RL optimizes the\nscheduling of tasks across constellations, focussing on efficiently using\nlimited resources such as battery and memory. Both use cases were tested for\nmultiple satellite constellation configurations and operational scenarios,\nresembling the real-life spacecraft operations of communications and Earth\nobservation satellites.

This work explores whether a foundational\nsegmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as\nan annotator for unlabeled images. Specifically, we investigate the efficacy of\nusing SEEM, a Segment Anything Model (SAM) variant fine-tuned for textual\ninput, to generate predictive masks for unlabeled data. To address the\nshortcomings of using SEEM-generated masks as supervision, we propose\nConformalSAM, a novel SSSS framework which first calibrates the foundation\nmodel using the target domain's labeled data and then filters out unreliable\npixel labels of unlabeled data so that only high-confidence labels are used as\nsupervision. By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models\nto target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the\nstrong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which\nbenefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training\nstrategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training\nstage. Our experiment demonstrates that, on three standard benchmarks of SSSS,\nConformalSAM achieves superior performance compared to recent SSSS methods and\nhelps boost the performance of those methods as a plug-in."}

Given the widespread use of Vision Transformers (ViTs)\nin robot learning, we integrate gaze information into ViTs using a foveated\npatch tokenization scheme inspired by recent work in image segmentation.\nCompared to uniform patch tokenization, this significantly reduces the number\nof tokens-and thus computation-without sacrificing visual fidelity near regions\nof interest. We also explore two approaches to gaze imitation and prediction\nfrom human data.

This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance\nmatching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that\nenables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap,\nwe propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that\nshifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and\nutilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large\nVision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames,\nconstructing robust conceptual priors.

Furthermore, SeC adaptively\nbalances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching,\ndynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To\nrigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual\nreasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex\nScenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS).
