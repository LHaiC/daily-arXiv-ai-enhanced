By capturing the intricate relationships\nbetween diffraction patterns and crystal structures, DiffractGPT enables fast\nand accurate inverse design. Trained on thousands of atomic structures and\ntheir simulated XRD patterns from the JARVIS-DFT dataset, we evaluate the model\nacross three scenarios: (1) without chemical information, (2) with a list of\nelements, and (3) with an explicit chemical formula. The results demonstrate\nthat incorporating chemical information significantly enhances prediction\naccuracy.

However, the domain of game-playing poses\na particular challenge for evolutionary methods due to the inherently large\nstate space of video games. As the size of the input state expands, the size of\nthe policy must also increase in order to effectively learn the temporal\npatterns in the game space. Consequently, a larger policy must contain more\ntrainable parameters, exponentially increasing the size of the search space.\nAny increase in search space is highly problematic for evolutionary methods, as\nincreasing the number of trainable parameters is inversely correlated with\nconvergence speed. To reduce the size of the input space while maintaining a\nmeaningful representation of the original space, we introduce Sparse Cosine\nOptimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine\nTransform (DCT) as a pseudo attention mechanism, transforming an input state\ninto a coefficient matrix.

We demonstrate the effectiveness\nof SCOPE as the policy for the Atari game Space Invaders. In this task, SCOPE\nwith CMA-ES outperforms evolutionary methods that consider an unmodified input\nstate, such as OpenAI-ES and HyperNEAT.

Although this does\nnot constrain the choice of framework when retargeting from one person to\nanother, it does force the tracker to use the game/VR character rig when\nretargeting to a game/VR character. We utilize volumetric morphing in order to\nfit facial rigs to both performers and targets; in addition, a carefully chosen\nset of Simon-Says expressions is used to calibrate each rig to the motion\nsignatures of the relevant performer or target. Although a uniform set of\nSimon-Says expressions can likely be used for all person to person retargeting,\nwe argue that person to game/VR character retargeting benefits from Simon-Says\nexpressions that capture the distinct motion signature of the game/VR character\nrig. The Simon-Says calibrated rigs tend to produce the desired expressions\nwhen exercising animation controls (as expected). Unfortunately, these\nwell-calibrated rigs still lead to undesirable controls when tracking a\nperformance (a well-behaved function can have an arbitrarily ill-conditioned\ninverse), even though they typically produce acceptable geometry\nreconstructions.

In this work, we present an approach for\nimplementing real-time story identification for a news monitoring system that\nautomatically collects news articles as they appear online and processes them\nin various ways. Story identification aims to assign each news article to a\nspecific story that the article is covering. The process is similar to text\nclustering and topic modeling, but requires that articles be grouped based on\nparticular events, places, and people, rather than general text similarity (as\nin clustering) or general (predefined) topics (as in topic modeling). We\npresent an approach to story identification that is capable of functioning in\nreal time, assigning articles to stories as they are published online. In the\nproposed approach, we combine text representation techniques, clustering\nalgorithms, and online topic modeling methods. We combine various text\nrepresentation methods to extract specific events and named entities necessary\nfor story identification, showing that a mixture of online topic-modeling\napproaches such as BERTopic, DBStream, and TextClust can be adapted for story\ndiscovery. We evaluate our approach on a news dataset from Slovene media\ncovering a period of 1 month. We show that our real-time approach produces\nsensible results as judged by human evaluators."}

However, too many tokens\ngenerated in decoding phase, i.e., occupying the resources for a long time,\nessentially hamper the cloud from achieving a higher throughput. Meanwhile, due\nto limited on-device resources, the time to first token (TTFT), i.e., the\nlatency of prefill phase, increases dramatically with the growth on prompt\nlength. In order to concur with such a bottleneck on resources, i.e., long\noccupation in cloud and limited on-device computing capacity, we propose to\nseparate large language model between cloud and devices. That is, the cloud\nhelps a portion of the content for each device, only in its prefill phase.\nSpecifically, after receiving the first token from the cloud, decoupling with\nits own prefill, the device responds to the user immediately for a lower TTFT.\nThen, the following tokens from cloud are presented via a speed controller for\nsmoothed TPOT (the time per output token), until the device catches up with the\nprogress. On-device prefill is then amortized using received tokens while the\nresource usage in cloud is controlled. Moreover, during cloud prefill, the\nprompt can be refined, using those intermediate data already generated, to\nfurther speed up on-device inference. We implement such a scheme P/D-Device,\nand confirm its superiority over other alternatives. We further propose an\nalgorithm to decide the best settings.

In each stage,\nagents operate under the 3E Principle -- Explore, Examine, and Enhance -- to\nensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability\nlimitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing\nGuidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools.\nExperimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness.\nIts modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative\nmodels and tools. With just a brief user prompt, MAViS is capable of producing\nhigh-quality, expressive long-sequence video storytelling, enriching\ninspirations and creativity for users.

It incorporates several practical considerations in wireless\ncommunication systems, such as ability to handle variable number of resource\nblock (RB), dynamic number of transmit layers, physical resource block groups\n(PRGs) bundling size (BS), demodulation reference signal (DMRS) patterns with a\nsingle unified model, thereby, drastically simplifying the CE pipeline. Besides\nit addresses several limitations of the legacy linear MMSE solutions, for\nexample, by being independent of other reference signals and particularly by\njointly processing MIMO layers and differently precoded channels with unknown\nprecoding at the receiver. ReQuestNet comprises of two sub-units, CoarseNet\nfollowed by RefinementNet. CoarseNet performs per PRG, per transmit-receive\n(Tx-Rx) stream channel estimation, while RefinementNet refines the CoarseNet\nchannel estimate by incorporating correlations across differently precoded\nPRGs, and correlation across multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channel\nspatial dimensions (cross-MIMO). Simulation results demonstrate that ReQuestNet\nsignificantly outperforms genie minimum mean squared error (MMSE) CE across a\nwide range of channel conditions, delay-Doppler profiles, achieving up to 10dB\ngain at high SNRs.

Traditional CV-QKD usually employ coherent\nreceivers to detect coherent states, whose detection performance is restricted\nto the standard quantum limit. In this paper, we employ a generalized Kennedy\nreceiver called CD-Kennedy receiver to enhance the detection performance of\ncoherent states in turbulent channels, where equal-gain combining (EGC) method\nis used to combine the output of CD-Kennedy receivers. Besides, we derive the\nSKR of a post-selection based CV-QKD protocol using both CD-Kennedy receiver\nand homodyne receiver with EGC in turbulent channels.

In this work, we develop an algorithm to solve a\nblack-box optimization problem by improving Factorization Machine Annealing\n(FMA) such that the training of a machine learning model called Factorization\nMachine is performed not by a full dataset but by a subdataset which is sampled\nfrom a full dataset: Subsampling Factorization Machine Annealing (SFMA).\nAccording to such a probabilistic training process, the performance of FMA on\nexploring a solution space gets enhanced. As a result, SFMA exhibits balanced\nperformance of exploration and exploitation which we call\nexploitation-exploration functionality. We conduct numerical benchmarking tests\nto compare the performance of SFMA with that of FMA. Consequently, SFMA\ncertainly exhibits the exploration-exploitation functionality and outperforms\nFMA in speed and accuracy. In addition, the performance of SFMA can be further\nimproved by sequentially using two subsampling datasets with different sizes\nsuch that the size of the latter dataset is substantially smaller than the\nformer. Such a substantial reduction not only enhances the exploration\nperformance of SFMA but also enables us to run it with correspondingly low\ncomputational cost even for a large-scale problem. These results indicate the\neffectiveness of SFMA in a certain class of black-box optimization problems of\nsignificant size: the potential scalability of SFMA in solving large-scale\nproblems with correspondingly low computational cost."}

The\nsecond type, called localized-gorge BPs, which are somewhat similar to the\nlocalized-dip BPs but contain a gorge line. The third type, called\neverywhere-flat BPs, appears when the entire landscape is uniformly flat with\nalmost vanishing gradients, making optimization significantly more difficult.\nAfter illustrating these behaviors in the Gaussian function models, we extend\nthe analysis to the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE).

However, existing methods suffer from\nthe superficial elicitation problem: LLMs can only be steered to mimic shallow\nand unstable stylistic patterns, failing to embody the desired traits precisely\nand consistently across diverse tasks like humans. To address this challenge,\nwe propose IROTE, a novel in-context method for stable and transferable trait\nelicitation. Drawing on psychological theories suggesting that traits are\nformed through identity-related reflection, our method automatically generates\nand optimizes a textual self-reflection within prompts, which comprises\nself-perceived experience, to stimulate LLMs' trait-driven behavior. The\noptimization is performed by iteratively maximizing an information-theoretic\nobjective that enhances the connections between LLMs' behavior and the target\ntrait, while reducing noisy redundancy in reflection without any fine-tuning,\nleading to evocative and compact trait reflection. Extensive experiments across\nthree human trait systems manifest that one single IROTE-generated\nself-reflection can induce LLMs' stable impersonation of the target trait\nacross diverse downstream tasks beyond simple questionnaire answering,\nconsistently outperforming existing strong baselines."}

To enhance semantic guidance during keypoint\ngeneration, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract both global\nanatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics based on species-specific\nprompts. These textual priors are encoded and fused with image features via\ncross-attention modules to provide biologically meaningful constraints\nthroughout the denoising process. Additionally, a diffusion-based keypoint\ndecoder is designed to progressively refine pose predictions, improving\nrobustness to occlusion and annotation sparsity. Extensive experiments on\npublic animal pose datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization\ncapability of our method, especially under challenging scenarios with diverse\nspecies, cluttered backgrounds, and incomplete keypoints."}

Traditional methods for mitigating bias often rely on data\nfiltering or post-hoc output moderation, which treat the model as an opaque\nblack box. In this work, we introduce a complete, end-to-end system that uses\ntechniques from mechanistic interpretability to both identify and actively\nmitigate bias directly within a model's internal workings. Our method involves\ntwo primary stages. First, we train linear \"probes\" on the internal activations\nof a model to detect the latent representations of various biases (e.g.,\ngender, race, age). Our experiments on \\texttt{gpt2-large} demonstrate that\nthese probes can identify biased content with near-perfect accuracy, revealing\nthat bias representations become most salient in the model's later layers.\nSecond, we leverage these findings to compute \"steering vectors\" by contrasting\nthe model's activation patterns for biased and neutral statements. By adding\nthese vectors during inference, we can actively steer the model's generative\nprocess away from producing harmful, stereotypical, or biased content in\nreal-time. We demonstrate the efficacy of this activation steering technique,\nshowing that it successfully alters biased completions toward more neutral\nalternatives. We present our work as a robust and reproducible system that\noffers a more direct and interpretable approach to building safer and more\naccountable LLMs."}

However, such exploration is\ninherently challenging, and we often rely on extensive reward engineering,\nexpert demonstrations, or curriculum learning - all of which limit\ngeneralizability. In this work, we propose Skill Discovery as Exploration\n(SDAX), a novel learning framework that significantly reduces human engineering\neffort. SDAX leverages unsupervised skill discovery to autonomously acquire a\ndiverse repertoire of skills for overcoming obstacles. To dynamically regulate\nthe level of exploration during training, SDAX employs a bi-level optimization\nprocess that autonomously adjusts the degree of exploration. We demonstrate\nthat SDAX enables quadrupedal robots to acquire highly agile behaviors\nincluding crawling, climbing, leaping, and executing complex maneuvers such as\njumping off vertical walls. Finally, we deploy the learned policy on real\nhardware, validating its successful transfer to the real world."}

Robots, in contrast, often\nrequire hundreds of examples and still struggle to generalize beyond the\ntraining conditions. We argue that this limitation arises from the inability to\nrecover the latent explanations that underpin intelligent behavior, and that\nthese explanations can take the form of structured programs consisting of\nhigh-level goals, sub-task decomposition, and execution constraints. In this\nwork, we introduce Rational Inverse Reasoning (RIR), a framework for inferring\nthese latent programs through a hierarchical generative model of behavior. RIR\nframes few-shot imitation as Bayesian program induction: a vision-language\nmodel iteratively proposes structured symbolic task hypotheses, while a\nplanner-in-the-loop inference scheme scores each by the likelihood of the\nobserved demonstration under that hypothesis. This loop yields a posterior over\nconcise, executable programs. We evaluate RIR on a suite of continuous\nmanipulation tasks designed to test one-shot and few-shot generalization across\nvariations in object pose, count, geometry, and layout. With as little as one\ndemonstration, RIR infers the intended task structure and generalizes to novel\nsettings, outperforming state-of-the-art vision-language model baselines."}

However, inference\nover extended contexts is bottlenecked by the Key-Value (KV) cache, whose\nmemory footprint grows linearly with sequence length and dominates latency at\neach decoding step. While recent KV cache compression methods identify and load\nimportant tokens, they focus predominantly on input contexts and fail to\naddress the cumulative attention errors that arise during long decoding. In\nthis paper, we introduce RetroAttention, a novel KV cache update technique that\nretrospectively revises past attention outputs using newly arrived KV entries\nfrom subsequent decoding steps. By maintaining a lightweight output cache,\nRetroAttention enables past queries to efficiently access more relevant\ncontext, while incurring minimal latency overhead. This breaks the\nfixed-attention-output paradigm and allows continual correction of prior\napproximations.

Our approach\nconsists of a modular pipeline where the main code generator module is\nsupported by additional components that identify the most relevant columns and\nanalyze their data types to improve extraction accuracy.

The method features two core\nmodules: text-guided cross-domain alignment, which uses learnable prompts to\nunify visual and textual embeddings into a domain-invariant feature space, and\ncurriculum-driven pseudo label generation, which dynamically exploit more\ninformative unlabeled samples. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we also\nfacilitate bridging between domains via cross-domain knowledge distillation.\nExtensive experiments on \\textbf{11 popular datasets}, show that DPGNet\noutperforms SoTA approaches by \\textbf{6.3\\%}, highlighting its effectiveness\nin leveraging unlabeled data to address the annotation challenges posed by the\nincreasing realism of deepfakes."}

Our work here reveals a critical\nphenomenon, temporal oscillation, where correct answers often emerge in the\nmiddle process, but are overwritten in later denoising steps. To address this\nissue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal\nconsistency: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free, test-time\ndecoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select\nthe most consistent output; and 2) a post-training method termed Temporal\nConsistency Reinforcement, which uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a\nmeasure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward\nsignal to encourage stable generations. Empirical results across multiple\nbenchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using the negative\nTSE reward alone, we observe a remarkable average improvement of 24.7% on the\nCountdown dataset over an existing dLLM.
