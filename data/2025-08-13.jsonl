By capturing the intricate relationships\nbetween diffraction patterns and crystal structures, DiffractGPT enables fast\nand accurate inverse design. Trained on thousands of atomic structures and\ntheir simulated XRD patterns from the JARVIS-DFT dataset, we evaluate the model\nacross three scenarios: (1) without chemical information, (2) with a list of\nelements, and (3) with an explicit chemical formula. The results demonstrate\nthat incorporating chemical information significantly enhances prediction\naccuracy.

However, the domain of game-playing poses\na particular challenge for evolutionary methods due to the inherently large\nstate space of video games. As the size of the input state expands, the size of\nthe policy must also increase in order to effectively learn the temporal\npatterns in the game space. Consequently, a larger policy must contain more\ntrainable parameters, exponentially increasing the size of the search space.\nAny increase in search space is highly problematic for evolutionary methods, as\nincreasing the number of trainable parameters is inversely correlated with\nconvergence speed. To reduce the size of the input space while maintaining a\nmeaningful representation of the original space, we introduce Sparse Cosine\nOptimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine\nTransform (DCT) as a pseudo attention mechanism, transforming an input state\ninto a coefficient matrix.

Although this does\nnot constrain the choice of framework when retargeting from one person to\nanother, it does force the tracker to use the game/VR character rig when\nretargeting to a game/VR character. We utilize volumetric morphing in order to\nfit facial rigs to both performers and targets; in addition, a carefully chosen\nset of Simon-Says expressions is used to calibrate each rig to the motion\nsignatures of the relevant performer or target. Although a uniform set of\nSimon-Says expressions can likely be used for all person to person retargeting,\nwe argue that person to game/VR character retargeting benefits from Simon-Says\nexpressions that capture the distinct motion signature of the game/VR character\nrig. The Simon-Says calibrated rigs tend to produce the desired expressions\nwhen exercising animation controls (as expected). Unfortunately, these\nwell-calibrated rigs still lead to undesirable controls when tracking a\nperformance (a well-behaved function can have an arbitrarily ill-conditioned\ninverse), even though they typically produce acceptable geometry\nreconstructions.

In this work, we present an approach for\nimplementing real-time story identification for a news monitoring system that\nautomatically collects news articles as they appear online and processes them\nin various ways. Story identification aims to assign each news article to a\nspecific story that the article is covering. The process is similar to text\nclustering and topic modeling, but requires that articles be grouped based on\nparticular events, places, and people, rather than general text similarity (as\nin clustering) or general (predefined) topics (as in topic modeling). We\npresent an approach to story identification that is capable of functioning in\nreal time, assigning articles to stories as they are published online. In the\nproposed approach, we combine text representation techniques, clustering\nalgorithms, and online topic modeling methods. We combine various text\nrepresentation methods to extract specific events and named entities necessary\nfor story identification, showing that a mixture of online topic-modeling\napproaches such as BERTopic, DBStream, and TextClust can be adapted for story\ndiscovery. We evaluate our approach on a news dataset from Slovene media\ncovering a period of 1 month. We show that our real-time approach produces\nsensible results as judged by human evaluators."}

However, too many tokens\ngenerated in decoding phase, i.e., occupying the resources for a long time,\nessentially hamper the cloud from achieving a higher throughput. Meanwhile, due\nto limited on-device resources, the time to first token (TTFT), i.e., the\nlatency of prefill phase, increases dramatically with the growth on prompt\nlength. In order to concur with such a bottleneck on resources, i.e., long\noccupation in cloud and limited on-device computing capacity, we propose to\nseparate large language model between cloud and devices. That is, the cloud\nhelps a portion of the content for each device, only in its prefill phase.\nSpecifically, after receiving the first token from the cloud, decoupling with\nits own prefill, the device responds to the user immediately for a lower TTFT.\nThen, the following tokens from cloud are presented via a speed controller for\nsmoothed TPOT (the time per output token), until the device catches up with the\nprogress. On-device prefill is then amortized using received tokens while the\nresource usage in cloud is controlled. Moreover, during cloud prefill, the\nprompt can be refined, using those intermediate data already generated, to\nfurther speed up on-device inference. We implement such a scheme P/D-Device,\nand confirm its superiority over other alternatives. We further propose an\nalgorithm to decide the best settings.

While\nselecting a node from an OPEN list with $N$ nodes has $O(1)$ runtime complexity\nwith traditional array-based priority-queues for dense integer keys, the\ntree-based OPEN list used by MCTS requires $O(\\log N)$, which roughly\ncorresponds to the search depth $d$. In classical planning, $d$ is arbitrarily\nlarge (e.g., $2^k-1$ in $k$-disk Tower-of-Hanoi) and the runtime for node\nselection is significant, unlike in game tree search, where the cost is\nnegligible compared to the node evaluation (rollouts) because $d$ is inherently\nlimited by the game (e.g., $d\\leq 361$ in Go). To improve this bottleneck, we\npropose a bilevel modification to MCTS that runs a best-first search from each\nselected leaf node with an expansion budget proportional to $d$, which achieves\namortized $O(1)$ runtime for node selection, equivalent to the traditional\nqueue-based OPEN list.

However, reported metasurfaces on this goal\nwere limited to a small Hilbert dimension, e.g., polarization qubits or spatial\nqudits with only a few states. When scaling up to higher-dimensional qudit\ntomography problems, especially those involving spatial qudits, a natural\nquestion arises: whether a metasurface with randomized nanostructures is\nsufficient to perform such qudit tomography, achieving optimal conditions. In\nthis work, we attempt to answer this question through a set of numerical\nexperiments with random metasurfaces, utilizing large-scale simulations of over\n11,000 distinct metasurfaces each exceeding 200 wavelengths in size.

We\npropose OverFill, which decouples these stages to optimize accuracy-efficiency\ntradeoffs. OverFill begins with a full model for prefill, processing system and\nuser inputs in parallel. It then switches to a dense pruned model, while\ngenerating tokens sequentially. Leveraging more compute during prefill,\nOverFill improves generation quality with minimal latency overhead. Our\n3B-to-1B OverFill configuration outperforms 1B pruned models by 83.2%, while\nthe 8B-to-3B configuration improves over 3B pruned models by 79.2% on average\nacross standard benchmarks.

It incorporates several practical considerations in wireless\ncommunication systems, such as ability to handle variable number of resource\nblock (RB), dynamic number of transmit layers, physical resource block groups\n(PRGs) bundling size (BS), demodulation reference signal (DMRS) patterns with a\nsingle unified model, thereby, drastically simplifying the CE pipeline. Besides\nit addresses several limitations of the legacy linear MMSE solutions, for\nexample, by being independent of other reference signals and particularly by\njointly processing MIMO layers and differently precoded channels with unknown\nprecoding at the receiver. ReQuestNet comprises of two sub-units, CoarseNet\nfollowed by RefinementNet. CoarseNet performs per PRG, per transmit-receive\n(Tx-Rx) stream channel estimation, while RefinementNet refines the CoarseNet\nchannel estimate by incorporating correlations across differently precoded\nPRGs, and correlation across multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channel\nspatial dimensions (cross-MIMO). Simulation results demonstrate that ReQuestNet\nsignificantly outperforms genie minimum mean squared error (MMSE) CE across a\nwide range of channel conditions, delay-Doppler profiles, achieving up to 10dB\ngain at high SNRs.

Traditional CV-QKD usually employ coherent\nreceivers to detect coherent states, whose detection performance is restricted\nto the standard quantum limit. In this paper, we employ a generalized Kennedy\nreceiver called CD-Kennedy receiver to enhance the detection performance of\ncoherent states in turbulent channels, where equal-gain combining (EGC) method\nis used to combine the output of CD-Kennedy receivers. Besides, we derive the\nSKR of a post-selection based CV-QKD protocol using both CD-Kennedy receiver\nand homodyne receiver with EGC in turbulent channels.

In this work, we develop an algorithm to solve a\nblack-box optimization problem by improving Factorization Machine Annealing\n(FMA) such that the training of a machine learning model called Factorization\nMachine is performed not by a full dataset but by a subdataset which is sampled\nfrom a full dataset: Subsampling Factorization Machine Annealing (SFMA).\nAccording to such a probabilistic training process, the performance of FMA on\nexploring a solution space gets enhanced. As a result, SFMA exhibits balanced\nperformance of exploration and exploitation which we call\nexploitation-exploration functionality. We conduct numerical benchmarking tests\nto compare the performance of SFMA with that of FMA. Consequently, SFMA\ncertainly exhibits the exploration-exploitation functionality and outperforms\nFMA in speed and accuracy. In addition, the performance of SFMA can be further\nimproved by sequentially using two subsampling datasets with different sizes\nsuch that the size of the latter dataset is substantially smaller than the\nformer. Such a substantial reduction not only enhances the exploration\nperformance of SFMA but also enables us to run it with correspondingly low\ncomputational cost even for a large-scale problem. These results indicate the\neffectiveness of SFMA in a certain class of black-box optimization problems of\nsignificant size: the potential scalability of SFMA in solving large-scale\nproblems with correspondingly low computational cost."}

The\nsecond type, called localized-gorge BPs, which are somewhat similar to the\nlocalized-dip BPs but contain a gorge line. The third type, called\neverywhere-flat BPs, appears when the entire landscape is uniformly flat with\nalmost vanishing gradients, making optimization significantly more difficult.\nAfter illustrating these behaviors in the Gaussian function models, we extend\nthe analysis to the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). We consider two\ntypes of ans\\\"atze: the hardware-efficient ansatz and the random Pauli ansatz.\nFor both ans\\\"atze, we only observe the everywhere-flat BPs.

However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited\ntransferability across models due to their model-specific design and high\ncomputational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic\nadapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language\nmodels 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between\npre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner.

In this\nwork, we introduce Rational Inverse Reasoning (RIR), a framework for inferring\nthese latent programs through a hierarchical generative model of behavior. RIR\nframes few-shot imitation as Bayesian program induction: a vision-language\nmodel iteratively proposes structured symbolic task hypotheses, while a\nplanner-in-the-loop inference scheme scores each by the likelihood of the\nobserved demonstration under that hypothesis. This loop yields a posterior over\nconcise, executable programs. We evaluate RIR on a suite of continuous\nmanipulation tasks designed to test one-shot and few-shot generalization across\nvariations in object pose, count, geometry, and layout.

While\nthis design eases coordination, we hypothesize that it imposes cognitive load\ninterference, as the agent must interleave long-horizon reasoning with precise\nprogram synthesis. We validate this hypothesis through a controlled comparison\nbetween a reasoning-only agent and a reasoning-plus-code agent, finding that\nthe latter produces significantly fewer correct reasoning paths despite having\ntool-calling capabilities. To address this, we propose a dual-agent hybrid\nframework: a Reasoning Agent performs stepwise problem decomposition, and a\nCode Agent handles code generation and execution. Training combines imitation\nlearning and reinforcement learning: the Code Agent receives strong rewards for\nmatching intermediate ground-truth programs and weaker rewards for valid\nexecution, while the Reasoning Agent is optimized chiefly via final-answer\naccuracy using advantage estimation to credit intermediate steps. This\ndecoupled role design reduces cognitive interference and promotes stable\nreasoning-coding coordination."}

To address this challenge,\nwe propose IROTE, a novel in-context method for stable and transferable trait\nelicitation. Drawing on psychological theories suggesting that traits are\nformed through identity-related reflection, our method automatically generates\nand optimizes a textual self-reflection within prompts, which comprises\nself-perceived experience, to stimulate LLMs' trait-driven behavior. The\noptimization is performed by iteratively maximizing an information-theoretic\nobjective that enhances the connections between LLMs' behavior and the target\ntrait, while reducing noisy redundancy in reflection without any fine-tuning,\nleading to evocative and compact trait reflection.

Compared to human pose estimation, animal pose estimation\nis more challenging due to high interspecies morphological diversity, complex\nbody structures, and limited annotated data. In this work, we introduce\nDiffPose-Animal, a novel diffusion-based framework for top-down animal pose\nestimation. Unlike traditional heatmap regression methods, DiffPose-Animal\nreformulates pose estimation as a denoising process under the generative\nframework of diffusion models. To enhance semantic guidance during keypoint\ngeneration, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract both global\nanatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics based on species-specific\nprompts. These textual priors are encoded and fused with image features via\ncross-attention modules to provide biologically meaningful constraints\nthroughout the denoising process. Additionally, a diffusion-based keypoint\ndecoder is designed to progressively refine pose predictions, improving\nrobustness to occlusion and annotation sparsity.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence\n(AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have significantly improved\nthe precision and efficiency of detection methods, surpassing the limitations\nof manual identification. This study reviews modern computer-based techniques\nfor detecting plant diseases and pests from images, including recent AI\ndevelopments. The methodologies are organized into five categories:\nhyperspectral imaging, non-visualization techniques, visualization approaches,\nmodified deep learning architectures, and transformer models. This structured\ntaxonomy provides researchers with detailed, actionable insights for selecting\nadvanced state-of-the-art detection methods. A comprehensive survey of recent\nwork and comparative studies demonstrates the consistent superiority of modern\nAI-based approaches, which often outperform older image analysis methods in\nspeed and accuracy. In particular, vision transformers such as the Hierarchical\nVision Transformer (HvT) have shown accuracy exceeding 99.3% in plant disease\ndetection, outperforming architectures like MobileNetV3.

However, the domain of game-playing poses\na particular challenge for evolutionary methods due to the inherently large\nstate space of video games. As the size of the input state expands, the size of\nthe policy must also increase in order to effectively learn the temporal\npatterns in the game space. Consequently, a larger policy must contain more\ntrainable parameters, exponentially increasing the size of the search space.\nAny increase in search space is highly problematic for evolutionary methods, as\nincreasing the number of trainable parameters is inversely correlated with\nconvergence speed. To reduce the size of the input space while maintaining a\nmeaningful representation of the original space, we introduce Sparse Cosine\nOptimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine\nTransform (DCT) as a pseudo attention mechanism, transforming an input state\ninto a coefficient matrix.

By contrast, long range velocity flows approximate constant\ndisplacements directed from a high noise variant patch $x_0$ towards the\ncorresponding clean surface $x_1$. Here, noisy patches $x_t$ are viewed as\nintermediate states between the high noise variant and the clean patches. Our\nintuition is that long range information from velocity flow models can guide\nthe short range scores to align more closely with the clean points. In turn,\nscore models generally provide a quicker convergence to the clean surface.\nSpecifically, we devise two parallel modules, the ShortModule and LongModule,\neach consisting of an Encoder-Decoder pair to respectively account for\nshort-range scores and long-range flows. We find that short-range scores,\nguided by long-range features, yield filtered point clouds with good point\ndistributions and convergence near the clean surface. We design a joint loss\nfunction to simultaneously train the ShortModule and LongModule, in an\nend-to-end manner. Finally, we identify a key weakness in current displacement\nbased methods, limitations on the decoder architecture, and propose a dynamic\ngraph convolutional decoder to improve the inference process. Comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our HybridPF achieves state-of-the-art results\nwhile enabling faster inference speed."}

Traditional\napproaches, such as CT-to-US registration, incorporate anatomical information\nfrom preoperative CT scans to guide interventions, but they are limited by\ncomplex registration requirements, differences in spine curvature, and the need\nfor recent CT imaging. Recent shape completion methods can offer an alternative\nby reconstructing spinal structures in US data, while being pretrained on large\nset of publicly available CT scans. However, these approaches are typically\noffline and have limited reproducibility. In this work, we introduce a novel\nintegrated system that combines robotic ultrasound with real-time shape\ncompletion to enhance spinal visualization. Our robotic platform autonomously\nacquires US sweeps of the lumbar spine, extracts vertebral surfaces from\nultrasound, and reconstructs the complete anatomy using a deep learning-based\nshape completion network. This framework provides interactive, real-time\nvisualization with the capability to autonomously repeat scans and can enable\nnavigation to target locations. This can contribute to better consistency,\nreproducibility, and understanding of the underlying anatomy. We validate our\napproach through quantitative experiments assessing shape completion accuracy\nand evaluations of multiple spine acquisition protocols on a phantom setup.\nAdditionally, we present qualitative results of the visualization on a\nvolunteer scan."}

In this\nwork, we introduce Rational Inverse Reasoning (RIR), a framework for inferring\nthese latent programs through a hierarchical generative model of behavior. RIR\nframes few-shot imitation as Bayesian program induction: a vision-language\nmodel iteratively proposes structured symbolic task hypotheses, while a\nplanner-in-the-loop inference scheme scores each by the likelihood of the\nobserved demonstration under that hypothesis. This loop yields a posterior over\nconcise, executable programs. We evaluate RIR on a suite of continuous\nmanipulation tasks designed to test one-shot and few-shot generalization across\nvariations in object pose, count, geometry, and layout.

While recent KV cache compression methods identify and load\nimportant tokens, they focus predominantly on input contexts and fail to\naddress the cumulative attention errors that arise during long decoding. In\nthis paper, we introduce RetroAttention, a novel KV cache update technique that\nretrospectively revises past attention outputs using newly arrived KV entries\nfrom subsequent decoding steps.
