However, scaling these systems to millions of qubits for\npractical applications poses substantial challenges, particularly due to\ninterconnect bottlenecks. To address this challenge, extensive research has\nfocused on developing cryogenic multiplexers that enable minimal wiring between\nroom-temperature electronics and quantum processors. This paper investigates\nthe viability of commercial microelectromechanical system (MEMS) switches for\ncryogenic multiplexers in large-scale quantum computing systems. DC and RF\ncharacteristics of the MEMS switches are evaluated at cryogenic temperatures (<\n10 K) through finite element simulations and experimental measurements. Our\nresults demonstrate that MEMS switches exhibit improved on-resistance, lower\noperating voltage, and superior RF performance at cryogenic temperatures, with\nreliable operation over 100 million cycles. Furthermore, stable single-pole\nfour-throw (SP4T) switching and logical operations, including NAND and NOR\ngates, are demonstrated at cryogenic temperatures, validating their potential\nfor quantum computing. These results underscore the promise of MEMS switches in\nrealizing large-scale quantum computing systems."}

The traditional\napproach to checkpointing requires a pause in training to copy model states to\na separate location, allowing the state to be restored in the event of failure.\nThis approach fundamentally has a tradeoff between the frequency of checkpoints\nand the cost of a failure. We avoid this tradeoff; our key insight is that in\ndata-parallel training, all information necessary to create a checkpoint\nalready exists in the network as gradients.

Clock transitions (CTs), for which the system is immune to the\neffect of magnetic-field fluctuations to first order, provide a method to\nenhance the coherence time $T_2$, and to reveal mechanisms of decoherence that\nare not due to such fluctuations. Here we investigate two variants of Cr$_7$Mn,\na spin-1 molecular nanomagnet, at fields near a zero-field CT. We find that at\ntemperatures $\\le$2 K, $T_2\\sim1$ $\\mu$s at the CT using a Hahn-echo pulse\nsequence. Away from the CT, electron-spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM)\noscillations due to coupling to nuclear spins are observed and have a $T_2$ as\nhigh as $1.35$ $\\mu$s, indicating a distinct mechanism of coherence\npreservation. Dynamical decoupling with the CPMG pulse sequence yields\n$T_2\\sim\\!2.8$ $\\mu$s at the CT and up to $\\sim\\!3.6$ $\\mu$s in the ESEEM\nregime along with a demodulation of the oscillatory behavior. The experimental\nvalues of $T_2$ are largely independent of the degree of dilution of the\nmolecules in solvent or whether the solvent is deuterated, indicating that much\nof the decoherence and ESEEM arises from sources within the molecules\nthemselves. To account for decoherence, we develop a model that includes not\nonly field fluctuations but also fluctuations in the CT transition frequency\nitself. Our results can be well explained by treating the environment as a\ncombination of noise at the nuclear Larmor precession frequency and $1/f$ noise\nin the transverse anisotropy parameter $E$. Such information about the\nmicroscopic origins of decoherence can aid the rational design of\nmolecular-based spin qubits."}

To address this gap and improve\nresilience, we integrate community preferences to refine this partial order\nfrom the HFG into a total order. Our strategy involves getting the communities'\nopinions on their preferred sequence for repair crews to address infrastructure\nissues, considering potential constraints on resources. Due to the delay and\ncost associated with real-world survey data, we utilize a Large Language Model\n(LLM) as a proxy survey tool. We use the LLM to craft distinct personas\nrepresenting individuals, each with varied disaster experiences. We construct\ndiverse disaster scenarios, and each simulated persona provides input on\nprioritizing infrastructure repair needs across various communities. Finally,\nwe apply learning algorithms to generate a global order based on the aggregated\nresponses from these LLM-generated personas."}

We begin by characterising how diverse physical\nphenomena, ranging from human vital sign and motion to precipitation and flood\ndynamics, impact wireless signal propagation, producing measurable signatures\nin channel state information (CSI), Doppler profiles, and signal statistics. A\ncomprehensive analysis is then presented across two domains: human sensing\napplications including localisation, activity recognition, and vital sign\nmonitoring; and environmental sensing for rainfall, soil moisture, and water\nlevel.

The objective\nis for each broker to share a unique piece of information with all others\nsimultaneously. Unlike previous approaches, this protocol enables a fully\nparallel, single-step communication exchange among all brokers, regardless of\ntheir physical locations. A key feature of this protocol is its ability to\nensure both the anonymity and privacy of all participants are preserved,\nmeaning no broker can discern the identity of the sender behind any received\ninformation. At its core, the Quantum Dining Information Brokers Problem serves\nas a conceptual framework for achieving anonymous, untraceable, and massively\nparallel information exchange in a distributed system. The proposed protocol\nintroduces three significant advancements. First, while quantum protocols for\none-to-many simultaneous information transmission have been developed, this is,\nto the best of our knowledge, one of the first quantum protocols to facilitate\nmany-to-many simultaneous information exchange. Second, it guarantees complete\nanonymity and untraceability for all senders, a critical improvement over\nsequential applications of one-to-many protocols, which fail to ensure such\nrobust anonymity. Third, leveraging quantum entanglement, the protocol operates\nin a fully distributed manner, accommodating brokers in diverse spatial\nlocations. This approach marks a substantial advancement in secure, scalable,\nand anonymous communication, with potential applications in distributed\nenvironments where privacy and parallelism are paramount."}

Unlike airborne\nLiDAR, which typically delivers consistent accuracy across various scenes, the\naccuracy of photogrammetric point clouds is highly scene-dependent, since it\nrelies on algorithm-generated measurements (i.e., stereo or multi-view stereo).\nGenerally, errors of the photogrammetric point clouds propagate through a\ntwo-step process: Structure-from-Motion (SfM) with Bundle adjustment (BA),\nfollowed by Multi-view Stereo (MVS). While uncertainty estimation in the SfM\nstage has been well studied using the first-order statistics of the\nreprojection error function, that in the MVS stage remains largely unsolved and\nnon-standardized, primarily due to its non-differentiable and multi-modal\nnature (i.e., from pixel values to geometry).

Our core idea is to leverage the masking-then-reconstruction\nstrategy of MAE to encourage the feature encoder to infer missing spatial and\nstructural information, thereby facilitating geometric-aware and\nocclusion-robust representation learning. Specifically, based on our\nobservation that human hands exhibit far greater geometric complexity than\nrigid objects, conventional uniform masking fails to effectively guide the\nreconstruction of fine-grained hand structures. To overcome this limitation, we\nintroduce a Region-specific Mask Ratio Allocation, primarily comprising the\nregion-specific masking assignment and the skeleton-driven hand masking\nguidance. The former adaptively assigns lower masking ratios to hand regions\nthan to rigid objects, balancing their feature learning difficulty, while the\nlatter prioritizes masking critical hand parts (e.g., fingertips or entire\nfingers) to realistically simulate occlusion patterns in real-world\ninteractions. Furthermore, to enhance the geometric awareness of the pretrained\nencoder, we introduce a novel Masked Signed Distance Field (SDF)-driven\nmultimodal learning mechanism.

Large-scale multi-site studies have exist, but they have\nacquisition-related biases due to scanner heterogeneity, compromising imaging\nconsistency and downstream analyses. While existing SC harmonization methods -\nsuch as linear regression (LR), ComBat, and deep learning techniques - mitigate\nthese biases, they often rely on detailed metadata, traveling subjects (TS), or\noverlook the graph-topology of SCs. To address these limitations, we propose a\nsite-conditioned deep harmonization framework that harmonizes SCs across\ndiverse acquisition sites without requiring metadata or TS that we test in a\nsimulated scenario based on the Human Connectome Dataset. Within this\nframework, we benchmark three deep architectures - a fully connected\nautoencoder (AE), a convolutional AE, and a graph convolutional AE - against a\ntop-performing LR baseline. While non-graph models excel in edge-weight\nprediction and edge existence detection, the graph AE demonstrates superior\npreservation of topological structure and subject-level individuality, as\nreflected by graph metrics and fingerprinting accuracy, respectively. Although\nthe LR baseline achieves the highest numerical performance by explicitly\nmodeling acquisition parameters, it lacks applicability to real-world\nmulti-site use cases as detailed acquisition metadata is often unavailable. Our\nresults highlight the critical role of model architecture in SC harmonization\nperformance and demonstrate that graph-based approaches are particularly\nwell-suited for structure-aware, domain-generalizable SC harmonization in\nlarge-scale multi-site SC studies."}

In this work, we introduce a novel training-free approach\ntailored to improve image generation for a unique form of creative language:\npoetic verse, which frequently features layered, abstract, and dual meanings.\nOur proposed PoemTale Diffusion approach aims to minimise the information that\nis lost during poetic text-to-image conversion by integrating a multi stage\nprompt refinement loop into Language Models to enhance the interpretability of\npoetic texts. To support this, we adapt existing state-of-the-art diffusion\nmodels by modifying their self-attention mechanisms with a consistent\nself-attention technique to generate multiple consistent images, which are then\ncollectively used to convey the poem's meaning.

However, conventional 3D Gaussian primitives\ntightly couple geometry and appearance, leading to suboptimal stylization\nresults. To address this, we introduce TexGS-VolVis, a textured Gaussian\nsplatting framework for VolVis. TexGS-VolVis employs 2D Gaussian primitives,\nextending each Gaussian with additional texture and shading attributes,\nresulting in higher-quality, geometry-consistent stylization and enhanced\nlighting control during inference. Despite these improvements, achieving\nflexible and controllable scene editing remains challenging. To further enhance\nstylization, we develop image- and text-driven non-photorealistic scene editing\ntailored for TexGS-VolVis and 2D-lift-3D segmentation to enable partial editing\nwith fine-grained control. We evaluate TexGS-VolVis both qualitatively and\nquantitatively across various volume rendering scenes, demonstrating its\nsuperiority over existing methods in terms of efficiency, visual quality, and\nediting flexibility."}

Such dynamics contradict the objectives of continual learning,\nrevealing a lack of robustness in mitigating forgetting, and notably,\npersisting even under an ideal joint-loss regime. Examining this gap within\nthis idealized joint training context is critical to isolate it from other\nsources of forgetting. We argue that it reflects an imbalance between rapid\nadaptation and robust retention at task boundaries, underscoring the need to\ninvestigate mechanisms that reconcile plasticity and stability within continual\nlearning frameworks. Biological brains navigate a similar dilemma by operating\nconcurrently on multiple timescales, leveraging neuromodulatory signals to\nmodulate synaptic plasticity. However, artificial networks lack native\nmultitimescale dynamics, and although optimizers like momentum-SGD and Adam\nintroduce implicit timescale regularization, they still exhibit stability gaps.\nInspired by locus coeruleus mediated noradrenergic bursts, which transiently\nenhance neuronal gain under uncertainty to facilitate sensory assimilation, we\npropose uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics - an adaptive mechanism that\napproximates a two-timescale optimizer and dynamically balances integration of\nknowledge with minimal interference on previously consolidated information. We\nevaluate our mechanism on domain-incremental and class-incremental variants of\nthe MNIST and CIFAR benchmarks under joint training, demonstrating that\nuncertainty-modulated gain dynamics effectively attenuate the stability gap.\nFinally, our analysis elucidates how gain modulation replicates noradrenergic\nfunctions in cortical circuits, offering mechanistic insights into reducing\nstability gaps and enhance performance in continual learning tasks."}

Traditional clinical rating scales, though validated, are\nresource-intensive and lack scalability. Automated speech analysis with\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR) allows for objective quantification of\nlinguistic and temporal features of speech, offering scalable alternatives. The\nuse of utterance timestamps in ASR captures pause dynamics, which are thought\nto reflect the cognitive processes underlying speech production. However, the\nutility of integrating these ASR-derived features for assessing FTD severity\nrequires further evaluation. This study integrates pause features with semantic\ncoherence metrics across three datasets: naturalistic self-recorded diaries\n(AVH, n = 140), structured picture descriptions (TOPSY, n = 72), and dream\nnarratives (PsyCL, n = 43). We evaluated pause related features alongside\nestablished coherence measures, using support vector regression (SVR) to\npredict clinical FTD scores. Key findings demonstrate that pause features alone\nrobustly predict the severity of FTD. Integrating pause features with semantic\ncoherence metrics enhanced predictive performance compared to semantic-only\nmodels, with integration of independent models achieving correlations up to\n\\r{ho} = 0.649 and AUC = 83.71% for severe cases detection (TOPSY, with best\n\\r{ho} = 0.584 and AUC = 79.23% for semantic-only models). The performance\ngains from semantic and pause features integration held consistently across all\ncontexts, though the nature of pause patterns was dataset-dependent. These\nfindings suggest that frameworks combining temporal and semantic analyses\nprovide a roadmap for refining the assessment of disorganized speech and\nadvance automated speech analysis in psychosis."}

Three representative\npractical considerations of EdgeSNN are discussed in depth: on-device inference\nusing lightweight SNN models, resource-aware training and updating under\nnon-stationary data conditions, and secure and privacy-preserving issues.\nFurthermore, we highlight the limitations of evaluating EdgeSNNs on\nconventional hardware and introduce a dual-track benchmarking strategy to\nsupport fair comparisons and hardware-aware optimization. Through this study,\nwe aim to bridge the gap between brain-inspired learning and practical edge\ndeployment, offering insights into current advancements, open challenges, and\nfuture research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\ndedicated and comprehensive survey on EdgeSNNs, providing an essential\nreference for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of\nneuromorphic computing and edge intelligence."}

Existing VolVis approaches have explored\nnon-photorealistic rendering techniques to enhance the clarity, expressiveness,\nand informativeness of visual communication. While effective, these methods\noften rely on complex predefined rules and are limited to transferring a single\nstyle, restricting their flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we\nadvocate the representation of VolVis scenes using differentiable Gaussian\nprimitives combined with pretrained large models to enable arbitrary style\ntransfer and real-time rendering. However, conventional 3D Gaussian primitives\ntightly couple geometry and appearance, leading to suboptimal stylization\nresults. To address this, we introduce TexGS-VolVis, a textured Gaussian\nsplatting framework for VolVis. TexGS-VolVis employs 2D Gaussian primitives,\nextending each Gaussian with additional texture and shading attributes,\nresulting in higher-quality, geometry-consistent stylization and enhanced\nlighting control during inference. Despite these improvements, achieving\nflexible and controllable scene editing remains challenging. To further enhance\nstylization, we develop image- and text-driven non-photorealistic scene editing\ntailored for TexGS-VolVis and 2D-lift-3D segmentation to enable partial editing\nwith fine-grained control. We evaluate TexGS-VolVis both qualitatively and\nquantitatively across various volume rendering scenes, demonstrating its\nsuperiority over existing methods in terms of efficiency, visual quality, and\nediting flexibility."}

Despite their\nimportance, they are severely underrepresented in large-scale EHR datasets. For\ninstance, in the widely used Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III\n(MIMIC-III) dataset, only about $8.56\\%$ of hospital visits include progress\nnotes, leaving gaps in longitudinal patient narratives. In contrast, the\ndataset contains a diverse array of other note types, each capturing different\naspects of care.\n  We present DENSE (Documenting Evolving Progress Notes from Scattered\nEvidence), a system designed to align with clinical documentation workflows by\nsimulating how physicians reference past encounters while drafting progress\nnotes. The system introduces a fine-grained note categorization and a temporal\nalignment mechanism that organizes heterogeneous notes across visits into\nstructured, chronological inputs. At its core, DENSE leverages a clinically\ninformed retrieval strategy to identify temporally and semantically relevant\ncontent from both current and prior visits. This retrieved evidence is used to\nprompt a large language model (LLM) to generate clinically coherent and\ntemporally aware progress notes.\n  We evaluate DENSE on a curated cohort of patients with multiple visits and\ncomplete progress note documentation. The generated notes demonstrate strong\nlongitudinal fidelity, achieving a temporal alignment ratio of $1.089$,\nsurpassing the continuity observed in original notes. By restoring narrative\ncoherence across fragmented documentation, our system supports improved\ndownstream tasks such as summarization, predictive modeling, and clinical\ndecision support, offering a scalable solution for LLM-driven note synthesis in\nreal-world healthcare settings."}

However, diagnosing AD remains a significant\nchallenge in neurology due to the confounders caused mainly by the selection\nbias of multimodal data and the complex relationships between variables. To\naddress these issues, we propose a novel visual-language causal intervention\nframework named Alzheimer's Disease Prediction with Cross-modal Causal\nIntervention (ADPC) for diagnostic assistance. Our ADPC employs large language\nmodel (LLM) to summarize clinical data under strict templates, maintaining\nstructured text outputs even with incomplete or unevenly distributed datasets.\nThe ADPC model utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI)\nimages and textual data generated by LLM to classify participants into\nCognitively Normal (CN), MCI, and AD categories. Because of the presence of\nconfounders, such as neuroimaging artifacts and age-related biomarkers,\nnon-causal models are likely to capture spurious input-output correlations,\ngenerating less reliable results. Our framework implicitly eliminates\nconfounders through causal intervention. Experimental results demonstrate the\noutstanding performance of our method in distinguishing CN/MCI/AD cases,\nachieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics across most evaluation metrics. The\nstudy showcases the potential of integrating causal reasoning with multi-modal\nlearning for neurological disease diagnosis."}

However, their unpredictability,\ncombined with the high potential for harm in this domain, means rigorous\nevaluation is necessary. Our goals with this track were to stimulate research\nand to provide high-quality evaluation of the most promising systems.\n  Methods: We hosted the Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts\n(PLABA) track at the 2023 and 2024 Text Retrieval Conferences. Tasks included\ncomplete, sentence-level, rewriting of abstracts (Task 1) as well as\nidentifying and replacing difficult terms (Task 2). For automatic evaluation of\nTask 1, we developed a four-fold set of professionally-written references.\nSubmissions for both Tasks 1 and 2 were provided extensive manual evaluation\nfrom biomedical experts.\n  Results: Twelve teams spanning twelve countries participated in the track,\nwith models from multilayer perceptrons to large pretrained transformers. In\nmanual judgments of Task 1, top-performing models rivaled human levels of\nfactual accuracy and completeness, but not simplicity or brevity. Automatic,\nreference-based metrics generally did not correlate well with manual judgments.\nIn Task 2, systems struggled with identifying difficult terms and classifying\nhow to replace them. When generating replacements, however, LLM-based systems\ndid well in manually judged accuracy, completeness, and simplicity, though not\nin brevity.\n  Conclusion: The PLABA track showed promise for using Large Language Models to\nadapt biomedical literature for the general public, while also highlighting\ntheir deficiencies and the need for improved automatic benchmarking tools."}

The lack of robust automated\nedit-quality metrics hinders reliable automation at scale. We present an\nautomated, modular pipeline that mines high-fidelity triplets across domains,\nresolutions, instruction complexities, and styles.

However,\nconventional imbalance strategies fundamentally conflict with KANs mathematical\nstructure as resampling and focal loss implementations significantly degrade\nKANs performance, while marginally benefiting MLPs.

However, in many real-world applications, data are\nhigh-dimensional with varying input lengths and naturally take the form of\nirregular tensors. To analyze such data, irregular tensor decomposition is\ncritical for extracting meaningful clusters that capture essential information.\nIn this paper, we focus on modeling causal representation learning based on the\ntransformed information. First, we present a novel causal formulation for a set\nof latent clusters. We then propose CaRTeD, a joint learning framework that\nintegrates temporal causal representation learning with irregular tensor\ndecomposition. Notably, our framework provides a blueprint for downstream tasks\nusing the learned tensor factors, such as modeling latent structures and\nextracting causal information, and offers a more flexible regularization design\nto enhance tensor decomposition. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm\nconverges to a stationary point. More importantly, our results fill the gap in\ntheoretical guarantees for the convergence of state-of-the-art irregular tensor\ndecomposition.
