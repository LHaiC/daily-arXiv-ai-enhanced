Abstract: Eye tracking for wearable systems demands low latency and milliwatt-level power, but conventional frame-based pipelines struggle with motion blur, high compute cost, and limited temporal resolution. Such capabilities are vital for enabling seamless and responsive interaction in emerging technologies like augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), where understanding user gaze is key to immersion and interface design. Neuromorphic sensors and spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative, yet existing SNN approaches are either too specialized or fall short of the performance of modern ANN architectures. This paper presents a neuromorphic version of top-performing event-based eye-tracking models, replacing their recurrent and attention modules with lightweight LIF layers and exploiting depth-wise separable convolutions to reduce model complexity. Our models obtain 3.7-4.1px mean error, approaching the accuracy of the application-specific neuromorphic system, Retina (3.24px), while reducing model size by 20x and theoretical compute by 850x, compared to the closest ANN variant of the proposed model. These efficient variants are projected to operate at an estimated 3.9-4.9 mW with 3 ms latency at 1 kHz. The present results indicate that high-performing event-based eye-tracking architectures can be redesigned as SNNs with substantial efficiency gains, while retaining accuracy suitable for real-time wearable deployment.

Abstract: Weakly supervised oriented object detection (WS-OOD) has gained attention as a cost-effective alternative to fully supervised methods, providing both efficiency and high accuracy. Among weakly supervised approaches, horizontal bounding box (HBox)-supervised OOD stands out for its ability to directly leverage existing HBox annotations while achieving the highest accuracy under weak supervision settings. This paper introduces adaptive bounding box scaling and symmetry-prior-based orientation prediction, called ABBSPO, a framework for WS-OOD. Our ABBSPO addresses limitations of previous HBox-supervised OOD methods, which compare ground truth (GT) HBoxes directly with the minimum circumscribed rectangles of predicted RBoxes, often leading to inaccurate scale estimation. To overcome this, we propose: (i) Adaptive Bounding Box Scaling (ABBS), which appropriately scales GT HBoxes to optimize for the size of each predicted RBox, ensuring more accurate scale prediction; and (ii) a Symmetric Prior Angle (SPA) loss that exploits inherent symmetry of aerial objects for self-supervised learning, resolving issues in previous methods where learning collapses when predictions for all three augmented views (original, rotated, and flipped) are consistently incorrect. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ABBSPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Diffusion Denoising models demonstrated impressive results across generative Computer Vision tasks, but they still fail to outperform standard autoregressive solutions in the discrete domain, and only match them at best. In this work, we propose a different paradigm by adopting diffusion models to provide suggestions to the autoregressive generation rather than replacing them. By doing so, we combine the bidirectional and refining capabilities of the former with the strong linguistic structure provided by the latter. To showcase its effectiveness, we present Show, Suggest and Tell (SST), which achieves State-of-the-Art results on COCO, among models in a similar setting. In particular, SST achieves 125.1 CIDEr-D on the COCO dataset without Reinforcement Learning, outperforming both autoregressive and diffusion model State-of-the-Art results by 1.5 and 2.5 points. On top of the strong results, we performed extensive experiments to validate the proposal and analyze the impact of the suggestion module. Results demonstrate a positive correlation between suggestion and caption quality, overall indicating a currently underexplored but promising research direction. Code will be available at: https://github.com/jchenghu/show\_suggest\_tell.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Representation alignment (REPA) guides generative training by distilling representations from a strong, pretrained vision encoder to intermediate diffusion features. We investigate a fundamental question: what aspect of the target representation matters for generation, its \textit{global} \revision{semantic} information (e.g., measured by ImageNet-1K accuracy) or its spatial structure (i.e. pairwise cosine similarity between patch tokens)? Prevalent wisdom holds that stronger global semantic performance leads to better generation as a target representation. To study this, we first perform a large-scale empirical analysis across 27 different vision encoders and different model scales. The results are surprising; spatial structure, rather than global performance, drives the generation performance of a target representation. To further study this, we introduce two straightforward modifications, which specifically accentuate the transfer of \emph{spatial} information. We replace the standard MLP projection layer in REPA with a simple convolution layer and introduce a spatial normalization layer for the external representation. Surprisingly, our simple method (implemented in $<$4 lines of code), termed iREPA, consistently improves convergence speed of REPA, across a diverse set of vision encoders, model sizes, and training variants (such as REPA, REPA-E, Meanflow, JiT etc). %, etc. Our work motivates revisiting the fundamental working mechanism of representational alignment and how it can be leveraged for improved training of generative models.

Abstract: Modern deep learning methods have achieved impressive results across tasks from disease classification, estimating continuous biomarkers, to generating realistic medical images. Most of these approaches are trained to model conditional distributions defined by a specific predictive direction with a specific set of input variables. We introduce MetaVoxel, a generative joint diffusion modeling framework that models the joint distribution over imaging data and clinical metadata by learning a single diffusion process spanning all variables. By capturing the joint distribution, MetaVoxel unifies tasks that traditionally require separate conditional models and supports flexible zero-shot inference using arbitrary subsets of inputs without task-specific retraining. Using more than 10,000 T1-weighted MRI scans paired with clinical metadata from nine datasets, we show that a single MetaVoxel model can perform image generation, age estimation, and sex prediction, achieving performance comparable to established task-specific baselines. Additional experiments highlight its capabilities for flexible inference.Together, these findings demonstrate that joint multimodal diffusion offers a promising direction for unifying medical AI models and enabling broader clinical applicability.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language models have achieved remarkable results in various domains, such as image captioning and conditioned image generation. Nevertheless, these models still encounter difficulties in achieving human-like compositional generalization. In this study, we propose a new method called Independent Density Estimation (IDE) to tackle this challenge. IDE aims to learn the connection between individual words in a sentence and the corresponding features in an image, enabling compositional generalization. We build two models based on the philosophy of IDE. The first one utilizes fully disentangled visual representations as input, and the second leverages a Variational Auto-Encoder to obtain partially disentangled features from raw images. Additionally, we propose an entropy-based compositional inference method to combine predictions of each word in the sentence. Our models exhibit superior generalization to unseen compositions compared to current models when evaluated on various datasets.

Abstract: We present TraceFlow, a novel framework for high-fidelity rendering of dynamic specular scenes by addressing two key challenges: precise reflection direction estimation and physically accurate reflection modeling. To achieve this, we propose a Residual Material-Augmented 2D Gaussian Splatting representation that models dynamic geometry and material properties, allowing accurate reflection ray computation. Furthermore, we introduce a Dynamic Environment Gaussian and a hybrid rendering pipeline that decomposes rendering into diffuse and specular components, enabling physically grounded specular synthesis via rasterization and ray tracing. Finally, we devise a coarse-to-fine training strategy to improve optimization stability and promote physically meaningful decomposition. Extensive experiments on dynamic scene benchmarks demonstrate that TraceFlow outperforms prior methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, producing sharper and more realistic specular reflections in complex dynamic environments.

Abstract: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Screening mammography reduces mortality, yet interpretation still suffers from substantial false negatives and false positives, and model accuracy often degrades when deployed across scanners, modalities, and patient populations. We propose a simple conditioning signal aimed at improving external performance based on a wavelet based vectorization of persistent homology. Using topological data analysis, we summarize image structure that persists across intensity thresholds and convert this information into spatial, multi scale maps that are provably stable to small intensity perturbations. These maps are integrated into a two stage detection pipeline through input level channel concatenation. The model is trained and validated on the CBIS DDSM digitized film mammography cohort from the United States and evaluated on two independent full field digital mammography cohorts from Portugal (INbreast) and China (CMMD), with performance reported at the patient level. On INbreast, augmenting ConvNeXt Tiny with wavelet persistence channels increases patient level AUC from 0.55 to 0.75 under a limited training budget.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) drive modern machine vision but are challenging to deploy on edge devices due to high compute demands. Traditional approaches-running the full model on-device or offloading to the cloud face trade-offs in latency, bandwidth, and privacy. Splitting the inference workload between the edge and the cloud offers a balanced solution, but transmitting intermediate features to enable such splitting introduces new bandwidth challenges. To address this, the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) initiated the Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) standard, establishing a bitstream syntax and codec pipeline tailored for compressing intermediate features. This paper presents the design and performance of the Feature Coding Test Model (FCTM), showing significant bitrate reductions-averaging 85.14%-across multiple vision tasks while preserving accuracy. FCM offers a scalable path for efficient and interoperable deployment of intelligent features in bandwidth-limited and privacy-sensitive consumer applications.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for autonomous driving explore inference-time reasoning as a way to improve driving performance and safety in challenging scenarios. Most prior work uses natural language to express chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before producing driving actions. However, text may not be the most efficient representation for reasoning. In this work, we present Latent-CoT-Drive (LCDrive): a model that expresses CoT in a latent language that captures possible outcomes of the driving actions being considered. Our approach unifies CoT reasoning and decision making by representing both in an action-aligned latent space. Instead of natural language, the model reasons by interleaving (1) action-proposal tokens, which use the same vocabulary as the model's output actions; and (2) world model tokens, which are grounded in a learned latent world model and express future outcomes of these actions. We cold start latent CoT by supervising the model's action proposals and world model tokens based on ground-truth future rollouts of the scene. We then post-train with closed-loop reinforcement learning to strengthen reasoning capabilities. On a large-scale end-to-end driving benchmark, LCDrive achieves faster inference, better trajectory quality, and larger improvements from interactive reinforcement learning compared to both non-reasoning and text-reasoning baselines.

Abstract: Machines are increasingly becoming the primary consumers of visual data, yet most deployments of machine-to-machine systems still rely on remote inference where pixel-based video is streamed using codecs optimized for human perception. Consequently, this paradigm is bandwidth intensive, scales poorly, and exposes raw images to third parties. Recent efforts in the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) redesigned the pipeline for machine-to-machine communication: Video Coding for Machines (VCM) is designed to apply task-aware coding tools in the pixel domain, and Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) is designed to compress intermediate neural features to reduce bitrate, preserve privacy, and support compute offload. Experiments show that FCM is capable of maintaining accuracy close to edge inference while significantly reducing bitrate. Additional analysis of H.26X codecs used as inner codecs in FCM reveals that H.265/High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) and H.266/Versatile Video Coding (VVC) achieve almost identical machine task performance, with an average BD-Rate increase of 1.39% when VVC is replaced with HEVC. In contrast, H.264/Advanced Video Coding (AVC) yields an average BD-Rate increase of 32.28% compared to VVC. However, for the tracking task, the impact of codec choice is minimal, with HEVC outperforming VVC and achieving BD Rate of -1.81% and 8.79% for AVC, indicating that existing hardware for already deployed codecs can support machine-to-machine communication without degrading performance.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback has emerged as a standard for aligning diffusion models. However, we identify a fundamental limitation in the standard DPO formulation because it relies on the Bradley-Terry model to aggregate diverse evaluation axes like aesthetic quality and semantic alignment into a single scalar reward. This aggregation creates a reward conflict where the model is forced to unlearn desirable features of a specific dimension if they appear in a globally non-preferred sample. To address this issue, we propose Multi Reward Conditional DPO (MCDPO). This method resolves reward conflicts by introducing a disentangled Bradley-Terry objective. MCDPO explicitly injects a preference outcome vector as a condition during training, which allows the model to learn the correct optimization direction for each reward axis independently within a single network. We further introduce dimensional reward dropout to ensure balanced optimization across dimensions. Extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and SDXL demonstrate that MCDPO achieves superior performance on benchmarks. Notably, our conditional framework enables dynamic and multiple-axis control at inference time using Classifier Free Guidance to amplify specific reward dimensions without additional training or external reward models.

Abstract: Semi-supervised few-shot learning (SSFSL) formulates real-world applications like ''auto-annotation'', as it aims to learn a model over a few labeled and abundant unlabeled examples to annotate the unlabeled ones. Despite the availability of powerful open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and their pretraining data, the SSFSL literature largely neglects these open-source resources. In contrast, the related area few-shot learning (FSL) has already exploited them to boost performance. Arguably, to achieve auto-annotation in the real world, SSFSL should leverage such open-source resources. To this end, we start by applying established SSL methods to finetune a VLM. Counterintuitively, they significantly underperform FSL baselines. Our in-depth analysis reveals the root cause: VLMs produce rather ''flat'' distributions of softmax probabilities. This results in zero utilization of unlabeled data and weak supervision signals. We address this issue with embarrassingly simple techniques: classifier initialization and temperature tuning. They jointly increase the confidence scores of pseudo-labels, improving the utilization rate of unlabeled data, and strengthening supervision signals. Building on this, we propose: Stage-Wise Finetuning with Temperature Tuning (SWIFT), which enables existing SSL methods to effectively finetune a VLM on limited labeled data, abundant unlabeled data, and task-relevant but noisy data retrieved from the VLM's pretraining set. Extensive experiments on five SSFSL benchmarks show that SWIFT outperforms recent FSL and SSL methods by $\sim$5 accuracy points. SWIFT even rivals supervised learning, which finetunes VLMs with the unlabeled data being labeled with ground truth!

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated video technologies poses challenges to information integrity. While recent benchmarks advance AIGC video detection, they overlook a critical factor: many state-of-the-art generative models embed digital watermarks in outputs, and detectors may partially rely on these patterns. To evaluate this influence, we present RobustSora, the benchmark designed to assess watermark robustness in AIGC video detection. We systematically construct a dataset of 6,500 videos comprising four types: Authentic-Clean (A-C), Authentic-Spoofed with fake watermarks (A-S), Generated-Watermarked (G-W), and Generated-DeWatermarked (G-DeW). Our benchmark introduces two evaluation tasks: Task-I tests performance on watermark-removed AI videos, while Task-II assesses false alarm rates on authentic videos with fake watermarks. Experiments with ten models spanning specialized AIGC detectors, transformer architectures, and MLLM approaches reveal performance variations of 2-8pp under watermark manipulation. Transformer-based models show consistent moderate dependency (6-8pp), while MLLMs exhibit diverse patterns (2-8pp). These findings indicate partial watermark dependency and highlight the need for watermark-aware training strategies. RobustSora provides essential tools to advance robust AIGC detection research.

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation requires both global context and local structure to ensure robustness against intra-class variations. However, 3D graph convolution (3D-GC) methods only focus on local geometry and depth information, making them vulnerable to complex objects and visual ambiguities. To address this, we present THE-Pose, a novel category-level 6D pose estimation framework that leverages a topological prior via surface embedding and hybrid graph fusion. Specifically, we extract consistent and invariant topological features from the image domain, effectively overcoming the limitations inherent in existing 3D-GC based methods. Our Hybrid Graph Fusion (HGF) module adaptively integrates the topological features with point-cloud features, seamlessly bridging 2D image context and 3D geometric structure. These fused features ensure stability for unseen or complicated objects, even under significant occlusions. Extensive experiments on the REAL275 dataset show that THE-Pose achieves a 35.8% improvement over the 3D-GC baseline (HS-Pose) and surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by 7.2% across all key metrics.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of cardiac chambers in echocardiography sequences is crucial for the quantitative analysis of cardiac function, aiding in clinical diagnosis and treatment. The imaging noise, artifacts, and the deformation and motion of the heart pose challenges to segmentation algorithms. While existing methods based on convolutional neural networks, Transformers, and space-time memory networks have improved segmentation accuracy, they often struggle with the trade-off between capturing long-range spatiotemporal dependencies and maintaining computational efficiency with fine-grained feature representation. In this paper, we introduce GDKVM, a novel architecture for echocardiography video segmentation. The model employs Linear Key-Value Association (LKVA) to effectively model inter-frame correlations, and introduces Gated Delta Rule (GDR) to efficiently store intermediate memory states. Key-Pixel Feature Fusion (KPFF) module is designed to integrate local and global features at multiple scales, enhancing robustness against boundary blurring and noise interference. We validated GDKVM on two mainstream echocardiography video datasets (CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic) and compared it with various state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show that GDKVM outperforms existing approaches in terms of segmentation accuracy and robustness, while ensuring real-time performance.

Abstract: Novel Class Discovery aims to utilise prior knowledge of known classes to classify and discover unknown classes from unlabelled data. Existing NCD methods for images primarily rely on visual features, which suffer from limitations such as insufficient feature discriminability and the long-tail distribution of data. We propose LLM-NCD, a multimodal framework that breaks this bottleneck by fusing visual-textual semantics and prototype guided clustering. Our key innovation lies in modelling cluster centres and semantic prototypes of known classes by jointly optimising known class image and text features, and a dualphase discovery mechanism that dynamically separates known or novel samples via semantic affinity thresholds and adaptive clustering. Experiments on the CIFAR-100 dataset show that compared to the current methods, this method achieves up to 25.3% improvement in accuracy for unknown classes. Notably, our method shows unique resilience to long tail distributions, a first in NCD literature.

Abstract: Recent advances in generalizable Gaussian splatting (GS) have enabled feed-forward reconstruction of scenes from tens of input views. Long-LRM notably scales this paradigm to 32 input images at $950\times540$ resolution, achieving 360° scene-level reconstruction in a single forward pass. However, directly predicting millions of Gaussian parameters at once remains highly error-sensitive: small inaccuracies in positions or other attributes lead to noticeable blurring, particularly in fine structures such as text. In parallel, implicit representation methods such as LVSM and LaCT have demonstrated significantly higher rendering fidelity by compressing scene information into model weights rather than explicit Gaussians, and decoding RGB frames using the full transformer or TTT backbone. However, this computationally intensive decompression process for every rendered frame makes real-time rendering infeasible. These observations raise key questions: Is the deep, sequential "decompression" process necessary? Can we retain the benefits of implicit representations while enabling real-time performance? We address these questions with Long-LRM++, a model that adopts a semi-explicit scene representation combined with a lightweight decoder. Long-LRM++ matches the rendering quality of LaCT on DL3DV while achieving real-time 14 FPS rendering on an A100 GPU, overcoming the speed limitations of prior implicit methods. Our design also scales to 64 input views at the $950\times540$ resolution, demonstrating strong generalization to increased input lengths. Additionally, Long-LRM++ delivers superior novel-view depth prediction on ScanNetv2 compared to direct depth rendering from Gaussians. Extensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component in the proposed framework.

Abstract: Adversarial distillation in the standard min-max adversarial training framework aims to transfer adversarial robustness from a large, robust teacher network to a compact student. However, existing work often neglects to incorporate state-of-the-art robust teachers. Through extensive analysis, we find that stronger teachers do not necessarily yield more robust students-a phenomenon known as robust saturation. While typically attributed to capacity gaps, we show that such explanations are incomplete. Instead, we identify adversarial transferability-the fraction of student-crafted adversarial examples that remain effective against the teacher-as a key factor in successful robustness transfer. Based on this insight, we propose Sample-wise Adaptive Adversarial Distillation (SAAD), which reweights training examples by their measured transferability without incurring additional computational cost. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet show that SAAD consistently improves AutoAttack robustness over prior methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/HongsinLee/saad.

Abstract: We introduce MotionEdit, a novel dataset for motion-centric image editing-the task of modifying subject actions and interactions while preserving identity, structure, and physical plausibility. Unlike existing image editing datasets that focus on static appearance changes or contain only sparse, low-quality motion edits, MotionEdit provides high-fidelity image pairs depicting realistic motion transformations extracted and verified from continuous videos. This new task is not only scientifically challenging but also practically significant, powering downstream applications such as frame-controlled video synthesis and animation.
  To evaluate model performance on the novel task, we introduce MotionEdit-Bench, a benchmark that challenges models on motion-centric edits and measures model performance with generative, discriminative, and preference-based metrics. Benchmark results reveal that motion editing remains highly challenging for existing state-of-the-art diffusion-based editing models. To address this gap, we propose MotionNFT (Motion-guided Negative-aware Fine Tuning), a post-training framework that computes motion alignment rewards based on how well the motion flow between input and model-edited images matches the ground-truth motion, guiding models toward accurate motion transformations. Extensive experiments on FLUX.1 Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit show that MotionNFT consistently improves editing quality and motion fidelity of both base models on the motion editing task without sacrificing general editing ability, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Shot transitions play a pivotal role in multi-shot video generation, as they determine the overall narrative expression and the directorial design of visual storytelling. However, recent progress has primarily focused on low-level visual consistency across shots, neglecting how transitions are designed and how cinematographic language contributes to coherent narrative expression. This often leads to mere sequential shot changes without intentional film-editing patterns. To address this limitation, we propose ShotDirector, an efficient framework that integrates parameter-level camera control and hierarchical editing-pattern-aware prompting. Specifically, we adopt a camera control module that incorporates 6-DoF poses and intrinsic settings to enable precise camera information injection. In addition, a shot-aware mask mechanism is employed to introduce hierarchical prompts aware of professional editing patterns, allowing fine-grained control over shot content. Through this design, our framework effectively combines parameter-level conditions with high-level semantic guidance, achieving film-like controllable shot transitions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we construct ShotWeaver40K, a dataset that captures the priors of film-like editing patterns, and develop a set of evaluation metrics for controllable multi-shot video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: We introduce Disentangled360, an innovative 3D-aware technology that integrates the advantages of direction disentangled volume rendering with single-image 360° unique view synthesis for applications in medical imaging and natural scene reconstruction. In contrast to current techniques that either oversimplify anisotropic light behavior or lack generalizability across various contexts, our framework distinctly differentiates between isotropic and anisotropic contributions inside a Gaussian Splatting backbone. We implement a dual-branch conditioning framework, one optimized for CT intensity driven scattering in volumetric data and the other for real-world RGB scenes through normalized camera embeddings. To address scale ambiguity and maintain structural realism, we present a hybrid pose agnostic anchoring method that adaptively samples scene depth and material transitions, functioning as stable pivots during scene distillation. Our design integrates preoperative radiography simulation and consumer-grade 360° rendering into a singular inference pipeline, facilitating rapid, photorealistic view synthesis with inherent directionality. Evaluations on the Mip-NeRF 360, RealEstate10K, and DeepDRR datasets indicate superior SSIM and LPIPS performance, while runtime assessments confirm its viability for interactive applications. Disentangled360 facilitates mixed-reality medical supervision, robotic perception, and immersive content creation, eliminating the necessity for scene-specific finetuning or expensive photon simulations.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising potential in Vision-Language Navigation (VLN). However, their practical development is severely hindered by the substantial training overhead. We recognize two key issues that contribute to the overhead: (1) the quadratic computational burden from processing long-horizon historical observations as massive sequences of tokens, and (2) the exploration-efficiency trade-off in DAgger, i.e., a data aggregation process of collecting agent-explored trajectories. While more exploration yields effective error-recovery trajectories for handling test-time distribution shifts, it comes at the cost of longer trajectory lengths for both training and inference. To address these challenges, we propose Efficient-VLN, a training-efficient VLN model. Specifically, to mitigate the token processing burden, we design two efficient memory mechanisms: a progressive memory that dynamically allocates more tokens to recent observations, and a learnable recursive memory that utilizes the key-value cache of learnable tokens as the memory state. Moreover, we introduce a dynamic mixed policy to balance the exploration-efficiency trade-off. Extensive experiments show that Efficient-VLN achieves state-of-the-art performance on R2R-CE (64.2% SR) and RxR-CE (67.0% SR). Critically, our model consumes merely 282 H800 GPU hours, demonstrating a dramatic reduction in training overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) in histopathology seeks to reduce annotation cost by learning from image-level labels, yet it remains limited by inter-class homogeneity, intra-class heterogeneity, and the region-shrinkage effect of CAM-based supervision. We propose a simple and effective prototype-driven framework that leverages vision-language alignment to improve region discovery under weak supervision. Our method integrates CoOp-style learnable prompt tuning to generate text-based prototypes and combines them with learnable image prototypes, forming a dual-modal prototype bank that captures both semantic and appearance cues. To address oversmoothing in ViT representations, we incorporate a multi-scale pyramid module that enhances spatial precision and improves localization quality. Experiments on the BCSS-WSSS benchmark show that our approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, and detailed analyses demonstrate the benefits of text description diversity, context length, and the complementary behavior of text and image prototypes. These results highlight the effectiveness of jointly leveraging textual semantics and visual prototype learning for WSSS in digital pathology.

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) in histopathology relies heavily on classification backbones, yet these models often localize only the most discriminative regions and struggle to capture the full spatial extent of tissue structures. Vision-language models such as CONCH offer rich semantic alignment and morphology-aware representations, while modern segmentation backbones like SegFormer preserve fine-grained spatial cues. However, combining these complementary strengths remains challenging, especially under weak supervision and without dense annotations. We propose a prototype learning framework for WSSS in histopathological images that integrates morphology-aware representations from CONCH, multi-scale structural cues from SegFormer, and text-guided semantic alignment to produce prototypes that are simultaneously semantically discriminative and spatially coherent. To effectively leverage these heterogeneous sources, we introduce text-guided prototype initialization that incorporates pathology descriptions to generate more complete and semantically accurate pseudo-masks. A structural distillation mechanism transfers spatial knowledge from SegFormer to preserve fine-grained morphological patterns and local tissue boundaries during prototype learning. Our approach produces high-quality pseudo masks without pixel-level annotations, improves localization completeness, and enhances semantic consistency across tissue types. Experiments on BCSS-WSSS datasets demonstrate that our prototype learning framework outperforms existing WSSS methods while remaining computationally efficient through frozen foundation model backbones and lightweight trainable adapters.

To address these challenges, we introduce Point2Pose, a framework that effectively models the distribution of human poses conditioned on sequential point cloud and pose history. Specifically, we employ a spatio-temporal point cloud encoder and a pose feature encoder to extract joint-wise features, followed by an attention-based generative regressor. Additionally, we present a large-scale indoor dataset MVPose3D, which contains multiple modalities, including IMU data of non-trivial human motions, dense multi-view point clouds, and RGB images. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating its superior performance across various datasets.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Audio-Visual Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) face prohibitive computational overhead from massive audio and video tokens. Token reduction, while extensively explored for video-only LLMs, is insufficient for the audio-visual domain, as these unimodal methods cannot leverage audio-visual cross-modal synergies. Furthermore, the distinct and dynamic information densities of audio and video render static budgets per modality suboptimal. How to perform token reduction on a joint audio-visual stream thus remains an unaddressed bottleneck. To fill this gap, we introduce EchoingPixels, a framework inspired by the coexistence and interaction of visuals and sound in real-world scenes. The core of our framework is the Cross-Modal Semantic Sieve (CS2), a module enabling early audio-visual interaction. Instead of compressing modalities independently, CS2 co-attends to the joint multimodal stream and reduces tokens from an entire combined pool of audio-visual tokens rather than using fixed budgets per modality. This single-pool approach allows it to adaptively allocate the token budget across both modalities and dynamically identify salient tokens in concert. To ensure this aggressive reduction preserves the vital temporal modeling capability, we co-design a Synchronization-Augmented RoPE (Sync-RoPE) to maintain critical temporal relationships for the sparsely selected tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoingPixels achieves performance comparable to strong baselines using only 5-20% of the original tokens, with a 2-3x speedup and memory reduction.

Abstract: Foundation models trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) on large-scale histological images have significantly accelerated the development of computational pathology. These models can serve as backbones for region-of-interest (ROI) image analysis or patch-level feature extractors in whole-slide images (WSIs) based on multiple instance learning (MIL). Existing pathology foundation models (PFMs) are typically pre-trained on Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) stained pathology images. However, images with special stains, such as immunohistochemistry, are also frequently used in clinical practice. PFMs pre-trained mainly on H\&E-stained images may be limited in clinical applications involving special stains. To address this issue, we propose StainNet, a specialized foundation model for special stains based on the vision transformer (ViT) architecture. StainNet adopts a self-distillation SSL approach and is trained on over 1.4 million patch images cropping from 20,231 publicly available special staining WSIs in the HISTAI database. To evaluate StainNet, we conduct experiments on an in-house slide-level liver malignancy classification task and two public ROI-level datasets to demonstrate its strong ability. We also perform few-ratio learning and retrieval evaluations, and compare StainNet with recently larger PFMs to further highlight its strengths. We have released the StainNet model weights at: https://huggingface.co/JWonderLand/StainNet.

Abstract: Incomplete multi-view data, where different views suffer from missing and unbalanced observations, pose significant challenges for clustering. Existing imputation-based methods attempt to estimate missing views to restore data associations, but indiscriminate imputation often introduces noise and bias, especially when the available information is insufficient. Imputation-free methods avoid this risk by relying solely on observed data, but struggle under severe incompleteness due to the lack of cross-view complementarity. To address this issue, we propose Informativeness-based Selective imputation Multi-View Clustering (ISMVC). Our method evaluates the imputation-relevant informativeness of each missing position based on intra-view similarity and cross-view consistency, and selectively imputes only when sufficient support is available. Furthermore, we integrate this selection with a variational autoencoder equipped with a mixture-of-Gaussians prior to learn clustering-friendly latent representations. By performing distribution-level imputation, ISMVC not only stabilizes the aggregation of posterior distributions but also explicitly models imputation uncertainty, enabling robust fusion and preventing overconfident reconstructions. Compared with existing cautious imputation strategies that depend on training dynamics or model feedback, our method is lightweight, data-driven, and model-agnostic. It can be readily integrated into existing IMC models as a plug-in module. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets under a more realistic and challenging unbalanced missing scenario demonstrate that our method outperforms both imputation-based and imputation-free approaches.

Abstract: Thin and elongated filamentous structures, such as microtubules and actin filaments, often play important roles in biological systems. Segmenting these filaments in biological images is a fundamental step for quantitative analysis. Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the performance of filament segmentation. However, there is a big challenge in acquiring high quality pixel-level annotated dataset for filamentous structures, as the dense distribution and geometric properties of filaments making manual annotation extremely laborious and time-consuming. To address the data shortage problem, we propose a conditional generative framework based on the Pix2Pix architecture to generate realistic filaments in microscopy images from binary masks. We also propose a filament-aware structural loss to improve the structure similarity when generating synthetic images. Our experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach and outperformed existing model trained without synthetic data.

Abstract: Real-World Image Super-Resolution (Real-ISR) aims to recover high-quality images from low-quality inputs degraded by unknown and complex real-world factors. Real-world scenarios involve diverse and coupled degradations, making it necessary to provide diffusion models with richer and more informative guidance. However, existing methods often assume known degradation severity and rely on CLIP text encoders that cannot capture numerical severity, limiting their generalization ability. To address this, we propose \textbf{HD-CLIP} (\textbf{H}ierarchical \textbf{D}egradation CLIP), which decomposes a low-quality image into a semantic embedding and an ordinal degradation embedding that captures ordered relationships and allows interpolation across unseen levels. Furthermore, we integrated it into diffusion models via classifier-free guidance (CFG) and proposed classifier-free projection guidance (CFPG). HD-CLIP leverages semantic cues to guide generative restoration while using degradation cues to suppress undesired hallucinations and artifacts. As a \textbf{plug-and-play module}, HD-CLIP can be seamlessly integrated into various super-resolution frameworks without training, significantly improving detail fidelity and perceptual realism across diverse real-world datasets.

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit impressive complex reasoning capabilities but remain largely unexplored in visual sequential planning, i.e., executing multi-step actions towards a goal. Additionally, practical sequential planning often involves non-optimal (erroneous) steps, challenging VLMs to detect and correct such steps. We propose Corrective Sequential Planning Benchmark (CoSPlan) to evaluate VLMs in error-prone, vision-based sequential planning tasks across 4 domains: maze navigation, block rearrangement, image reconstruction,and object reorganization. CoSPlan assesses two key abilities: Error Detection (identifying non-optimal action) and Step Completion (correcting and completing action sequences to reach the goal). Despite using state-of-the-art reasoning techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and Scene Graphs, VLMs (e.g. Intern-VLM and Qwen2) struggle on CoSPlan, failing to leverage contextual cues to reach goals. Addressing this, we propose a novel training-free method, Scene Graph Incremental updates (SGI), which introduces intermediate reasoning steps between the initial and goal states. SGI helps VLMs reason about sequences, yielding an average performance gain of 5.2%. In addition to enhancing reliability in corrective sequential planning, SGI generalizes to traditional planning tasks such as Plan-Bench and VQA.

Abstract: We present Any4D, a scalable multi-view transformer for metric-scale, dense feed-forward 4D reconstruction. Any4D directly generates per-pixel motion and geometry predictions for N frames, in contrast to prior work that typically focuses on either 2-view dense scene flow or sparse 3D point tracking. Moreover, unlike other recent methods for 4D reconstruction from monocular RGB videos, Any4D can process additional modalities and sensors such as RGB-D frames, IMU-based egomotion, and Radar Doppler measurements, when available. One of the key innovations that allows for such a flexible framework is a modular representation of a 4D scene; specifically, per-view 4D predictions are encoded using a variety of egocentric factors (depthmaps and camera intrinsics) represented in local camera coordinates, and allocentric factors (camera extrinsics and scene flow) represented in global world coordinates. We achieve superior performance across diverse setups - both in terms of accuracy (2-3X lower error) and compute efficiency (15X faster), opening avenues for multiple downstream applications.

Abstract: Motion generation is fundamental to computer animation and widely used across entertainment, robotics, and virtual environments. While recent methods achieve impressive results, most rely on fixed skeletal templates, which prevent them from generalizing to skeletons with different or perturbed topologies. We address the core limitation of current motion generation methods - the combined lack of large-scale heterogeneous animal motion data and unified generative frameworks capable of jointly modeling arbitrary skeletal topologies and textual conditions. To this end, we introduce OmniZoo, a large-scale animal motion dataset spanning 140 species and 32,979 sequences, enriched with multimodal annotations. Building on OmniZoo, we propose a generalized autoregressive motion generation framework capable of producing text-driven motions for arbitrary skeletal topologies. Central to our model is a Topology-aware Skeleton Embedding Module that encodes geometric and structural properties of any skeleton into a shared token space, enabling seamless fusion with textual semantics. Given a text prompt and a target skeleton, our method generates temporally coherent, physically plausible, and semantically aligned motions, and further enables cross-species motion style transfer.

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation offers a label-efficient solution to train segmentation models for volumetric medical imaging. However, existing approaches often rely on 2D encoders that neglect the inherent volumetric nature of the data. We propose TranSamba, a hybrid Transformer-Mamba architecture designed to capture 3D context for weakly supervised volumetric medical segmentation. TranSamba augments a standard Vision Transformer backbone with Cross-Plane Mamba blocks, which leverage the linear complexity of state space models for efficient information exchange across neighboring slices. The information exchange enhances the pairwise self-attention within slices computed by the Transformer blocks, directly contributing to the attention maps for object localization. TranSamba achieves effective volumetric modeling with time complexity that scales linearly with the input volume depth and maintains constant memory usage for batch processing. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that TranSamba establishes new state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming existing methods across diverse modalities and pathologies. Our source code and trained models are openly accessible at: https://github.com/YihengLyu/TranSamba.

Abstract: mmWave radars struggle to detect or count individuals in dense, static (non-moving) groups due to limitations in spatial resolution and reliance on movement for detection. We present mmCounter, which accurately counts static people in dense indoor spaces (up to three people per square meter). mmCounter achieves this by extracting ultra-low frequency (< 1 Hz) signals, primarily from breathing and micro-scale body movements such as slight torso shifts, and applying novel signal processing techniques to differentiate these subtle signals from background noise and nearby static objects. Our problem differs significantly from existing studies on breathing rate estimation, which assume the number of people is known a priori. In contrast, mmCounter utilizes a novel multi-stage signal processing pipeline to extract relevant low-frequency sources along with their spatial information and map these sources to individual people, enabling accurate counting. Extensive evaluations in various environments demonstrate that mmCounter delivers an 87% average F1 score and 0.6 mean absolute error in familiar environments, and a 60% average F1 score and 1.1 mean absolute error in previously untested environments. It can count up to seven individuals in a three square meter space, such that there is no side-by-side spacing and only a one-meter front-to-back distance.

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) task serves as a critical playground for evaluating whether foundation models can effectively perceive, understand, and reason about dynamic real-world scenarios. However, existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with simultaneously modeling spatial relationships within video frames and understanding the causal dynamics of temporal evolution on complex and reasoning-intensive VideoQA task. In this work, we equip MLLM with a comprehensive and extensible Video Toolkit, to enhance MLLM's spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities and ensure the harmony between the quantity and diversity of tools. To better control the tool invocation sequence and avoid toolchain shortcut issues, we propose a Spatiotemporal Reasoning Framework (STAR) that strategically schedules temporal and spatial tools, thereby progressively localizing the key area in the video. Our STAR framework enhances GPT-4o using lightweight tools, achieving an 8.2% gain on VideoMME and 4.6% on LongVideoBench. We believe that our proposed Video Toolkit and STAR framework make an important step towards building autonomous and intelligent video analysis assistants.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities, but often fail to perceive fine-grained visual details, limiting their applicability in precision-demanding tasks. While methods that crop salient regions of an image offer a partial solution, we identify a critical limitation they introduce: "Contextual Blindness". This failure occurs due to structural disconnect between high-fidelity details (from the crop) and the broader global context (from the original image), even when all necessary visual information is present. We argue that this limitation stems not from a lack of information 'Quantity', but from a lack of 'Structural Diversity' in the model's input. To resolve this, we propose Visual Funnel, a training-free, two-step approach. Visual Funnel first performs Contextual Anchoring to identify the region of interest in a single forward pass. It then constructs an Entropy-Scaled Portfolio that preserves the hierarchical context - ranging from focal detail to broader surroundings - by dynamically determining crop sizes based on attention entropy and refining crop centers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Visual Funnel significantly outperforms naive single-crop and unstructured multi-crop baselines. Our results further validate that simply adding more unstructured crops provides limited or even detrimental benefits, confirming that the hierarchical structure of our portfolio is key to resolving Contextual Blindness.

Abstract: Zero-shot Long Video Moment Retrieval (ZLVMR) is the task of identifying temporal segments in hour-long videos using a natural language query without task-specific training. The core technical challenge of LVMR stems from the computational infeasibility of processing entire lengthy videos in a single pass. This limitation has established a 'Search-then-Refine' approach, where candidates are rapidly narrowed down, and only those portions are analyzed, as the dominant paradigm for LVMR. However, existing approaches to this paradigm face severe limitations. Conventional supervised learning suffers from limited scalability and poor generalization, despite substantial resource consumption. Yet, existing zero-shot methods also fail, facing a dual challenge: (1) their heuristic strategies cause a 'search' phase candidate explosion, and (2) the 'refine' phase, which is vulnerable to semantic discrepancy, requires high-cost VLMs for verification, incurring significant computational overhead. We propose \textbf{P}oint-\textbf{to}-\textbf{S}pan (P2S), a novel training-free framework to overcome this challenge of inefficient 'search' and costly 'refine' phases. P2S overcomes these challenges with two key innovations: an 'Adaptive Span Generator' to prevent the search phase candidate explosion, and 'Query Decomposition' to refine candidates without relying on high-cost VLM verification. To our knowledge, P2S is the first zero-shot framework capable of temporal grounding in hour-long videos, outperforming supervised state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin (e.g., +3.7\% on R5@0.1 on MAD).

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a state-of-the-art method for novel view synthesis. However, its performance heavily relies on dense, high-quality input imagery, an assumption that is often violated in real-world applications, where data is typically sparse and motion-blurred. These two issues create a vicious cycle: sparse views ignore the multi-view constraints necessary to resolve motion blur, while motion blur erases high-frequency details crucial for aligning the limited views. Thus, reconstruction often fails catastrophically, with fragmented views and a low-frequency bias. To break this cycle, we introduce CoherentGS, a novel framework for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from sparse and blurry images. Our key insight is to address these compound degradations using a dual-prior strategy. Specifically, we combine two pre-trained generative models: a specialized deblurring network for restoring sharp details and providing photometric guidance, and a diffusion model that offers geometric priors to fill in unobserved regions of the scene. This dual-prior strategy is supported by several key techniques, including a consistency-guided camera exploration module that adaptively guides the generative process, and a depth regularization loss that ensures geometric plausibility. We evaluate CoherentGS through both quantitative and qualitative experiments on synthetic and real-world scenes, using as few as 3, 6, and 9 input views. Our results demonstrate that CoherentGS significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for this challenging task.

Abstract: Recent multimodal fusion methods, integrating images with LiDAR point clouds, have shown promise in scene flow estimation. However, the fusion of 4D millimeter wave radar and LiDAR remains unexplored. Unlike LiDAR, radar is cheaper, more robust in various weather conditions and can detect point-wise velocity, making it a valuable complement to LiDAR. However, radar inputs pose challenges due to noise, low resolution, and sparsity. Moreover, there is currently no dataset that combines LiDAR and radar data specifically for scene flow estimation. To address this gap, we construct a Radar-LiDAR scene flow dataset based on a public real-world automotive dataset. We propose an effective preprocessing strategy for radar denoising and scene flow label generation, deriving more reliable flow ground truth for radar points out of the object boundaries. Additionally, we introduce RaLiFlow, the first joint scene flow learning framework for 4D radar and LiDAR, which achieves effective radar-LiDAR fusion through a novel Dynamic-aware Bidirectional Cross-modal Fusion (DBCF) module and a carefully designed set of loss functions. The DBCF module integrates dynamic cues from radar into the local cross-attention mechanism, enabling the propagation of contextual information across modalities. Meanwhile, the proposed loss functions mitigate the adverse effects of unreliable radar data during training and enhance the instance-level consistency in scene flow predictions from both modalities, particularly for dynamic foreground areas. Extensive experiments on the repurposed scene flow dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing LiDAR-based and radar-based single-modal methods by a significant margin.

Abstract: Accurate spatial understanding is essential for image-guided surgery, augmented reality integration and context awareness. In minimally invasive procedures, where visual input is the sole intraoperative modality, establishing precise pixel-level correspondences between endoscopic frames is critical for 3D reconstruction, camera tracking, and scene interpretation. However, the surgical domain presents distinct challenges: weak perspective cues, non-Lambertian tissue reflections, and complex, deformable anatomy degrade the performance of conventional computer vision techniques. While Deep Learning models have shown strong performance in natural scenes, their features are not inherently suited for fine-grained matching in surgical images and require targeted adaptation to meet the demands of this domain. This research presents a novel Deep Learning pipeline for establishing feature correspondences in endoscopic image pairs, alongside a self-supervised optimization framework for model training. The proposed methodology leverages a novel-view synthesis pipeline to generate ground-truth inlier correspondences, subsequently utilized for mining triplets within a contrastive learning paradigm. Through this self-supervised approach, we augment the DINOv2 backbone with an additional Transformer layer, specifically optimized to produce embeddings that facilitate direct matching through cosine similarity thresholding. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our pipeline surpasses state-of-the-art methodologies on the SCARED datasets improved matching precision and lower epipolar error compared to the related work. The proposed framework constitutes a valuable contribution toward enabling more accurate high-level computer vision applications in surgical endoscopy.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have made remarkable progress, enabling sophisticated vision-language interaction and dialogue applications. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on reasoning tasks, often neglecting fine-grained recognition, which is crucial for practical application scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce the Fine-grained Recognition Open World (FROW) benchmark, designed for detailed evaluation of LVLMs with GPT-4o. On the basis of that, we propose a novel optimization strategy from two perspectives: \textit{data construction} and \textit{training process}, to improve the performance of LVLMs. Our dataset includes mosaic data, which combines multiple short-answer responses, and open-world data, generated from real-world questions and answers using GPT-4o, creating a comprehensive framework for evaluating fine-grained recognition in LVLMs. Experiments show that mosaic data improves category recognition accuracy by 1\% and open-world data boosts FROW benchmark accuracy by 10\%-20\% and content accuracy by 6\%-12\%. Meanwhile, incorporating fine-grained data into the pre-training phase can improve the model's category recognition accuracy by up to 10\%. The benchmark will be available at https://github.com/pc-inno/FROW.

Abstract: High-quality point cloud data is a critical foundation for tasks such as autonomous driving and 3D reconstruction. However, LiDAR-based point cloud acquisition is often affected by various disturbances, resulting in a large number of noise points that degrade the accuracy of subsequent point cloud object detection and recognition. Moreover, existing point cloud denoising methods typically sacrifice computational efficiency in pursuit of higher denoising accuracy, or, conversely, improve processing speed at the expense of preserving object boundaries and fine structural details, making it difficult to simultaneously achieve high denoising accuracy, strong edge preservation, and real-time performance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an adaptive dual-weight gravitational-based point cloud denoising method. First, an octree is employed to perform spatial partitioning of the global point cloud, enabling parallel acceleration. Then, within each leaf node, adaptive voxel-based occupancy statistics and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) density estimation are applied to rapidly remove clearly isolated and low-density noise points, thereby reducing the effective candidate set. Finally, a gravitational scoring function that combines density weights with adaptive distance weights is constructed to finely distinguish noise points from object points. Experiments conducted on the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository, the Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions (CADC) dataset, and in-house FMCW LiDAR point clouds acquired in our laboratory demonstrate that, compared with existing methods, the proposed approach achieves consistent improvements in F1, PSNR, and Chamfer Distance (CD) across various noise conditions while reducing the single-frame processing time, thereby validating its high accuracy, robustness, and real-time performance in multi-noise scenarios.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), earlier proven to be effective in large language and multi-modal models, has been successfully extended to enhance 2D image generation recently. However, applying RL to 3D generation remains largely unexplored due to the higher spatial complexity of 3D objects, which require globally consistent geometry and fine-grained local textures. This makes 3D generation significantly sensitive to reward designs and RL algorithms. To address these challenges, we conduct the first systematic study of RL for text-to-3D autoregressive generation across several dimensions. (1) Reward designs: We evaluate reward dimensions and model choices, showing that alignment with human preference is crucial, and that general multi-modal models provide robust signal for 3D attributes. (2) RL algorithms: We study GRPO variants, highlighting the effectiveness of token-level optimization, and further investigate the scaling of training data and iterations. (3) Text-to-3D Benchmarks: Since existing benchmarks fail to measure implicit reasoning abilities in 3D generation models, we introduce MME-3DR. (4) Advanced RL paradigms: Motivated by the natural hierarchy of 3D generation, we propose Hi-GRPO, which optimizes the global-to-local hierarchical 3D generation through dedicated reward ensembles. Based on these insights, we develop AR3D-R1, the first RL-enhanced text-to-3D model, expert from coarse shape to texture refinement. We hope this study provides insights into RL-driven reasoning for 3D generation. Code is released at https://github.com/Ivan-Tang-3D/3DGen-R1.

Abstract: The rapid growth of video content on platforms such as TikTok and YouTube has intensified the spread of multimodal hate speech, where harmful cues emerge subtly and asynchronously across visual, acoustic, and textual streams. Existing research primarily focuses on video-level classification, leaving the practically crucial task of temporal localisation, identifying when hateful segments occur, largely unaddressed. This challenge is even more noticeable under weak supervision, where only video-level labels are available, and static fusion or classification-based architectures struggle to capture cross-modal and temporal dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose MultiHateLoc, the first framework designed for weakly-supervised multimodal hate localisation. MultiHateLoc incorporates (1) modality-aware temporal encoders to model heterogeneous sequential patterns, including a tailored text-based preprocessing module for feature enhancement; (2) dynamic cross-modal fusion to adaptively emphasise the most informative modality at each moment and a cross-modal contrastive alignment strategy to enhance multimodal feature consistency; (3) a modality-aware MIL objective to identify discriminative segments under video-level supervision. Despite relying solely on coarse labels, MultiHateLoc produces fine-grained, interpretable frame-level predictions. Experiments on HateMM and MultiHateClip show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the localisation task.

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced vectorized road extraction in urban settings, yet off-road environments remain underexplored and challenging. A significant domain gap causes advanced models to fail in wild terrains due to two key issues: lack of large-scale vectorized datasets and structural weakness in prevailing methods. Models such as SAM-Road employ a node-centric paradigm that reasons at sparse endpoints, making them fragile to occlusions and ambiguous junctions in off-road scenes, leading to topological errors.This work addresses these limitations in two complementary ways. First, we release WildRoad, a gloabal off-road road network dataset constructed efficiently with a dedicated interactive annotation tool tailored for road-network labeling. Second, we introduce MaGRoad (Mask-aware Geodesic Road network extractor), a path-centric framework that aggregates multi-scale visual evidence along candidate paths to infer connectivity robustly.Extensive experiments show that MaGRoad achieves state-of-the-art performance on our challenging WildRoad benchmark while generalizing well to urban datasets. A streamlined pipeline also yields roughly 2.5x faster inference, improving practical applicability. Together, the dataset and path-centric paradigm provide a stronger foundation for mapping roads in the wild.

Abstract: Aerial-ground localization is difficult due to large viewpoint and modality gaps between ground-level LiDAR and overhead imagery. We propose TransLocNet, a cross-modal attention framework that fuses LiDAR geometry with aerial semantic context. LiDAR scans are projected into a bird's-eye-view representation and aligned with aerial features through bidirectional attention, followed by a likelihood map decoder that outputs spatial probability distributions over position and orientation. A contrastive learning module enforces a shared embedding space to improve cross-modal alignment. Experiments on CARLA and KITTI show that TransLocNet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing localization error by up to 63% and achieving sub-meter, sub-degree accuracy. These results demonstrate that TransLocNet provides robust and generalizable aerial-ground localization in both synthetic and real-world settings.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) enhances model robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) data by updating the model online during inference, yet existing methods lack theoretical insights into the fundamental causes of performance degradation under domain shifts. Recently, Neural Collapse (NC) has been proposed as an emergent geometric property of deep neural networks (DNNs), providing valuable insights for TTA. In this work, we extend NC to the sample-wise level and discover a novel phenomenon termed Sample-wise Alignment Collapse (NC3+), demonstrating that a sample's feature embedding, obtained by a trained model, aligns closely with the corresponding classifier weight. Building on NC3+, we identify that the performance degradation stems from sample-wise misalignment in adaptation which exacerbates under larger distribution shifts. This indicates the necessity of realigning the feature embeddings with their corresponding classifier weights. However, the misalignment makes pseudo-labels unreliable under domain shifts. To address this challenge, we propose NCTTA, a novel feature-classifier alignment method with hybrid targets to mitigate the impact of unreliable pseudo-labels, which blends geometric proximity with predictive confidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of NCTTA in enhancing robustness to domain shifts. For example, NCTTA outperforms Tent by 14.52% on ImageNet-C.

Abstract: This work presents an efficient algorithmic framework for real-time identification, classification, and evaluation of human physiotherapy exercises using mobile devices. The proposed method interprets a kinetic movement as a sequence of static poses, which are estimated from camera input using a pose-estimation neural network. Extracted body keypoints are transformed into trigonometric angle-based features and classified with lightweight supervised models to generate frame-level pose predictions and accuracy scores. To recognize full exercise movements and detect deviations from prescribed patterns, we employ a dynamic-programming scheme based on a modified Levenshtein distance algorithm, enabling robust sequence matching and localization of inaccuracies. The system operates entirely on the client side, ensuring scalability and real-time performance. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the methodology and highlights its applicability to remote physiotherapy supervision and m-health applications.

Abstract: Existing frameworks for learned video compression suffer from a dilemma between inaccurate temporal alignment and error propagation for motion estimation and compensation (ME/MC). The separate-transform framework employs distinct transforms for intra-frame and inter-frame compression to yield impressive rate-distortion (R-D) performance but causes evident error propagation, while the unified-transform framework eliminates error propagation via shared transforms but is inferior in ME/MC in shared latent domains. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel unifiedtransform framework with dual-domain progressive temporal alignment and quality-conditioned mixture-of-expert (QCMoE) to enable quality-consistent and error-propagation-free streaming for learned video compression. Specifically, we propose dualdomain progressive temporal alignment for ME/MC that leverages coarse pixel-domain alignment and refined latent-domain alignment to significantly enhance temporal context modeling in a coarse-to-fine fashion. The coarse pixel-domain alignment efficiently handles simple motion patterns with optical flow estimated from a single reference frame, while the refined latent-domain alignment develops a Flow-Guided Deformable Transformer (FGDT) over latents from multiple reference frames to achieve long-term motion refinement (LTMR) for complex motion patterns. Furthermore, we design a QCMoE module for continuous bit-rate adaptation that dynamically assigns different experts to adjust quantization steps per pixel based on target quality and content rather than relies on a single quantization step. QCMoE allows continuous and consistent rate control with appealing R-D performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves competitive R-D performance compared with the state-of-the-arts, while successfully eliminating error propagation.

Abstract: Shape-from-Focus (SFF) is a passive depth estimation technique that infers scene depth by analyzing focus variations in a focal stack. Most recent deep learning-based SFF methods typically operate in two stages: first, they extract focus volumes (a per pixel representation of focus likelihood across the focal stack) using heavy feature encoders; then, they estimate depth via a simple one-step aggregation technique that often introduces artifacts and amplifies noise in the depth map. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid framework. Our method computes multi-scale focus volumes traditionally using handcrafted Directional Dilated Laplacian (DDL) kernels, which capture long-range and directional focus variations to form robust focus volumes. These focus volumes are then fed into a lightweight, multi-scale GRU-based depth extraction module that iteratively refines an initial depth estimate at a lower resolution for computational efficiency. Finally, a learned convex upsampling module within our recurrent network reconstructs high-resolution depth maps while preserving fine scene details and sharp boundaries. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and traditional methods, achieving superior accuracy and generalization across diverse focal conditions.

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to segment novel classes in query images using only a small annotated support set. While prior research has mainly focused on improving decoders, the encoder's limited ability to extract meaningful features for unseen classes remains a key bottleneck. In this work, we introduce \textit{Take a Peek} (TaP), a simple yet effective method that enhances encoder adaptability for both FSS and cross-domain FSS (CD-FSS). TaP leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the encoder on the support set with minimal computational overhead, enabling fast adaptation to novel classes while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing FSS pipelines. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks--including COCO $20^i$, Pascal $5^i$, and cross-domain datasets such as DeepGlobe, ISIC, and Chest X-ray--demonstrate that TaP consistently improves segmentation performance across diverse models and shot settings. Notably, TaP delivers significant gains in complex multi-class scenarios, highlighting its practical effectiveness in realistic settings. A rank sensitivity analysis also shows that strong performance can be achieved even with low-rank adaptations, ensuring computational efficiency. By addressing a critical limitation in FSS--the encoder's generalization to novel classes--TaP paves the way toward more robust, efficient, and generalizable segmentation systems.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on various vision-language tasks, yet their visual perception remains limited. Humans, in comparison, perceive complex scenes efficiently by dynamically scanning and focusing on salient regions in a sequential "blink-like" process. Motivated by this strategy, we first investigate whether MLLMs exhibit similar behavior. Our pilot analysis reveals that MLLMs naturally attend to different visual regions across layers and that selectively allocating more computation to salient tokens can enhance visual perception. Building on this insight, we propose Blink, a dynamic visual token resolution framework that emulates the human-inspired process within a single forward pass. Specifically, Blink includes two modules: saliency-guided scanning and dynamic token resolution. It first estimates the saliency of visual tokens in each layer based on the attention map, and extends important tokens through a plug-and-play token super-resolution (TokenSR) module. In the next layer, it drops the extended tokens when they lose focus. This dynamic mechanism balances broad exploration and fine-grained focus, thereby enhancing visual perception adaptively and efficiently. Extensive experiments validate Blink, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing visual perception and multimodal understanding.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant advancements in vision understanding and reasoning. However, the autoregressive Transformer architecture used by MLLMs requries tokenization on input images, which limits their ability to accurately ground objects within the 2D image space. This raises an important question: how can sequential language tokens be improved to better ground objects in 2D spatial space for MLLMs? To address this, we present a spatial representation method for grounding objects, namely GETok, that integrates a specialized vocabulary of learnable tokens into MLLMs. GETok first uses grid tokens to partition the image plane into structured spatial anchors, and then exploits offset tokens to enable precise and iterative refinement of localization predictions. By embedding spatial relationships directly into tokens, GETok significantly advances MLLMs in native 2D space reasoning without modifying the autoregressive architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GETok achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods across various referring tasks in both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning settings.

Abstract: Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) is critical for bridging the communication gap between the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) community and the hearing world. However, robust ISLR is fundamentally constrained by data scarcity and the long-tail distribution of sign vocabulary, where gathering sufficient examples for thousands of unique signs is prohibitively expensive. Standard classification approaches struggle under these conditions, often overfitting to frequent classes while failing to generalize to rare ones. To address this bottleneck, we propose a Few-Shot Prototypical Network framework adapted for a skeleton based encoder. Unlike traditional classifiers that learn fixed decision boundaries, our approach utilizes episodic training to learn a semantic metric space where signs are classified based on their proximity to dynamic class prototypes. We integrate a Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) with a novel Multi-Scale Temporal Aggregation (MSTA) module to capture both rapid and fluid motion dynamics. Experimental results on the WLASL dataset demonstrate the superiority of this metric learning paradigm: our model achieves 43.75% Top-1 and 77.10% Top-5 accuracy on the test set. Crucially, this outperforms a standard classification baseline sharing the identical backbone architecture by over 13%, proving that the prototypical training strategy effectively outperforms in a data scarce situation where standard classification fails. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, achieving nearly 30% accuracy on the unseen SignASL dataset without fine-tuning, offering a scalable pathway for recognizing extensive sign vocabularies with limited data.

We further design a self-feedback audio agent to curate high-quality audio guidance, providing fine-grained temporal control. To facilitate this task, we additionally construct a large-scale dataset with instance-centric correspondence and comprehensive annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AVI-Edit outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, condition following, and audio-visual synchronization.

Abstract: All-in-one image restoration aims to handle diverse degradations (e.g., noise, blur, adverse weather) within a unified framework, yet existing methods increasingly rely on complex architectures (e.g., Mixture-of-Experts, diffusion models) and elaborate degradation prompt strategies. In this work, we reveal a critical insight: well-crafted feature extraction inherently encodes degradation-carrying information, and a symmetric U-Net architecture is sufficient to unleash these cues effectively. By aligning feature scales across encoder-decoder and enabling streamlined cross-scale propagation, our symmetric design preserves intrinsic degradation signals robustly, rendering simple additive fusion in skip connections sufficient for state-of-the-art performance. Our primary baseline, SymUNet, is built on this symmetric U-Net and achieves better results across benchmark datasets than existing approaches while reducing computational cost. We further propose a semantic enhanced variant, SE-SymUNet, which integrates direct semantic injection from frozen CLIP features via simple cross-attention to explicitly amplify degradation priors. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks validate the superiority of our methods. Both baselines SymUNet and SE-SymUNet establish simpler and stronger foundations for future advancements in all-in-one image restoration.

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD), a foundational task in computer vision, has advanced from single-modal to multi-modal paradigms to enhance generalization. However, most existing SOD methods assume low-noise visual conditions, overlooking the degradation of segmentation accuracy caused by weather-induced noise in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a SOD framework tailored for diverse weather conditions, encompassing a specific encoder and a replaceable decoder. To enable handling of varying weather noises, we introduce a one-hot vector as a noise indicator to represent different weather types and design a Noise Indicator Fusion Module (NIFM). The NIFM takes both semantic features and the noise indicator as dual inputs and is inserted between consecutive stages of the encoder to embed weather-aware priors via adaptive feature modulation. Critically, the proposed specific encoder retains compatibility with mainstream SOD decoders. Extensive experiments are conducted on the WXSOD dataset under varying training data scales (100%, 50%, 30% of the full training set), three encoder and seven decoder configurations. Results show that the proposed SOD framework (particularly the NIFM-enhanced specific encoder) improves segmentation accuracy under complex weather conditions compared to a vanilla encoder.

Abstract: Semantic retrieval of remote sensing (RS) images is a critical task fundamentally challenged by the \textquote{semantic gap}, the discrepancy between a model's low-level visual features and high-level human concepts. While large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising path to bridge this gap, existing methods often rely on costly, domain-specific training, and there is a lack of benchmarks to evaluate the practical utility of VLM-generated text in a zero-shot retrieval context. To address this research gap, we introduce the Remote Sensing Rich Text (RSRT) dataset, a new benchmark featuring multiple structured captions per image. Based on this dataset, we propose a fully training-free, text-only retrieval reference called TRSLLaVA. Our methodology reformulates cross-modal retrieval as a text-to-text (T2T) matching problem, leveraging rich text descriptions as queries against a database of VLM-generated captions within a unified textual embedding space. This approach completely bypasses model training or fine-tuning. Experiments on the RSITMD and RSICD benchmarks show our training-free method is highly competitive with state-of-the-art supervised models. For instance, on RSITMD, our method achieves a mean Recall of 42.62\%, nearly doubling the 23.86\% of the standard zero-shot CLIP baseline and surpassing several top supervised models. This validates that high-quality semantic representation through structured text provides a powerful and cost-effective paradigm for remote sensing image retrieval.

Abstract: We propose Track and Caption Any Motion (TCAM), a motion-centric framework for automatic video understanding that discovers and describes motion patterns without user queries. Understanding videos in challenging conditions like occlusion, camouflage, or rapid movement often depends more on motion dynamics than static appearance. TCAM autonomously observes a video, identifies multiple motion activities, and spatially grounds each natural language description to its corresponding trajectory through a motion-field attention mechanism. Our key insight is that motion patterns, when aligned with contrastive vision-language representations, provide powerful semantic signals for recognizing and describing actions. Through unified training that combines global video-text alignment with fine-grained spatial correspondence, TCAM enables query-free discovery of multiple motion expressions via multi-head cross-attention. On the MeViS benchmark, TCAM achieves 58.4% video-to-text retrieval, 64.9 JF for spatial grounding, and discovers 4.8 relevant expressions per video with 84.7% precision, demonstrating strong cross-task generalization.

Abstract: In recent years, the incidence of vision-threatening eye diseases has risen dramatically, necessitating scalable and accurate screening solutions. This paper presents a comprehensive study on deep learning architectures for the automated diagnosis of ocular conditions. To mitigate the "black-box" limitations of standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we implement a pipeline that combines deep feature extraction with interpretable image processing modules. Specifically, we focus on high-fidelity retinal vessel segmentation as an auxiliary task to guide the classification process. By grounding the model's predictions in clinically relevant morphological features, we aim to bridge the gap between algorithmic output and expert medical validation, thereby reducing false positives and improving deployment viability in clinical settings.

Abstract: We present Lang2Motion, a framework for language-guided point trajectory generation by aligning motion manifolds with joint embedding spaces. Unlike prior work focusing on human motion or video synthesis, we generate explicit trajectories for arbitrary objects using motion extracted from real-world videos via point tracking. Our transformer-based auto-encoder learns trajectory representations through dual supervision: textual motion descriptions and rendered trajectory visualizations, both mapped through CLIP's frozen encoders. Lang2Motion achieves 34.2% Recall@1 on text-to-trajectory retrieval, outperforming video-based methods by 12.5 points, and improves motion accuracy by 33-52% (12.4 ADE vs 18.3-25.3) compared to video generation baselines. We demonstrate 88.3% Top-1 accuracy on human action recognition despite training only on diverse object motions, showing effective transfer across motion domains. Lang2Motion supports style transfer, semantic interpolation, and latent-space editing through CLIP-aligned trajectory representations.

Abstract: Document parsing aims to transform unstructured PDF images into semi-structured data, facilitating the digitization and utilization of information in diverse domains. While vision language models (VLMs) have significantly advanced this task, achieving reliable, high-quality parsing in real-world scenarios remains challenging. Common practice often selects the top-performing model on standard benchmarks. However, these benchmarks may carry dataset-specific biases, leading to inconsistent model rankings and limited correlation with real-world performance. Moreover, benchmark metrics typically provide only overall scores, which can obscure distinct error patterns in output. This raises a key challenge: how can we reliably and comprehensively assess document parsing quality in the wild? We address this problem with DOCR-Inspector, which formalizes document parsing assessment as fine-grained error detection and analysis. Leveraging VLM-as-a-Judge, DOCR-Inspector analyzes a document image and its parsed output, identifies all errors, assigns them to one of 28 predefined types, and produces a comprehensive quality assessment. To enable this capability, we construct DOCRcase-200K for training and propose the Chain-of-Checklist reasoning paradigm to enable the hierarchical structure of parsing quality assessment. For empirical validation, we introduce DOCRcaseBench, a set of 882 real-world document parsing cases with manual annotations. On this benchmark, DOCR-Inspector-7B outperforms commercial models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, as well as leading open-source models. Further experiments demonstrate that its quality assessments provide valuable guidance for parsing results refinement, making DOCR-Inspector both a practical evaluator and a driver for advancing document parsing systems at scale. Model and code are released at: https://github.com/ZZZZZQT/DOCR-Inspector.

Abstract: Point tracking in video sequences is a foundational capability for real-world computer vision applications, including robotics, autonomous systems, augmented reality, and video analysis. While recent deep learning-based trackers achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging benchmarks, their reliance on per-frame GPU inference poses a major barrier to deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, where compute, power, and connectivity are limited. We introduce K-Track (Kalman-enhanced Tracking), a general-purpose, tracker-agnostic acceleration framework designed to bridge this deployment gap. K-Track reduces inference cost by combining sparse deep learning keyframe updates with lightweight Kalman filtering for intermediate frame prediction, using principled Bayesian uncertainty propagation to maintain temporal coherence. This hybrid strategy enables 5-10X speedup while retaining over 85% of the original trackers' accuracy. We evaluate K-Track across multiple state-of-the-art point trackers and demonstrate real-time performance on edge platforms such as the NVIDIA Jetson Nano and RTX Titan. By preserving accuracy while dramatically lowering computational requirements, K-Track provides a practical path toward deploying high-quality point tracking in real-world, resource-limited settings, closing the gap between modern tracking algorithms and deployable vision systems.

Abstract: Advances in generative modeling have made it increasingly easy to fabricate realistic portrayals of individuals, creating serious risks for security, communication, and public trust. Detecting such person-driven manipulations requires systems that not only distinguish altered content from authentic media but also provide clear and reliable reasoning. In this paper, we introduce TriDF, a comprehensive benchmark for interpretable DeepFake detection. TriDF contains high-quality forgeries from advanced synthesis models, covering 16 DeepFake types across image, video, and audio modalities. The benchmark evaluates three key aspects: Perception, which measures the ability of a model to identify fine-grained manipulation artifacts using human-annotated evidence; Detection, which assesses classification performance across diverse forgery families and generators; and Hallucination, which quantifies the reliability of model-generated explanations. Experiments on state-of-the-art multimodal large language models show that accurate perception is essential for reliable detection, but hallucination can severely disrupt decision-making, revealing the interdependence of these three aspects. TriDF provides a unified framework for understanding the interaction between detection accuracy, evidence identification, and explanation reliability, offering a foundation for building trustworthy systems that address real-world synthetic media threats.

Abstract: The complexity of autonomous driving scenarios requires robust models that can interpret high-level navigation commands and generate safe trajectories. While traditional rule-based systems can react to these commands, they often struggle in dynamic environments, and end-to-end methods face challenges in complying with explicit navigation commands. To address this, we present NaviHydra, a controllable navigation-guided end-to-end model distilled from an existing rule-based simulator. Our framework accepts high-level navigation commands as control signals, generating trajectories that align with specified intentions. We utilize a Bird's Eye View (BEV) based trajectory gathering method to enhance the trajectory feature extraction. Additionally, we introduce a novel navigation compliance metric to evaluate adherence to intended route, improving controllability and navigation safety. To comprehensively assess our model's controllability, we design a test that evaluates its response to various navigation commands. Our method significantly outperforms baseline models, achieving state-of-the-art results in the NAVSIM benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness in advancing autonomous driving.

Abstract: A deep understanding of the physical world is a central goal for embodied AI and realistic simulation. While current models excel at capturing an object's surface geometry and appearance, they largely neglect its internal physical properties. This omission is critical, as properties like volumetric density are fundamental for predicting an object's center of mass, stability, and interaction dynamics in applications ranging from robotic manipulation to physical simulation. The primary bottleneck has been the absence of large-scale, real-world data. To bridge this gap, we introduce XDen-1K, the first large-scale, multi-modal dataset designed for real-world physical property estimation, with a particular focus on volumetric density. The core of this dataset consists of 1,000 real-world objects across 148 categories, for which we provide comprehensive multi-modal data, including a high-resolution 3D geometric model with part-level annotations and a corresponding set of real-world biplanar X-ray scans. Building upon this data, we introduce a novel optimization framework that recovers a high-fidelity volumetric density field of each object from its sparse X-ray views. To demonstrate its practical value, we add X-ray images as a conditioning signal to an existing segmentation network and perform volumetric segmentation. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on downstream robotics tasks. The results show that leveraging the dataset can effectively improve the accuracy of center-of-mass estimation and the success rate of robotic manipulation. We believe XDen-1K will serve as a foundational resource and a challenging new benchmark, catalyzing future research in physically grounded visual inference and embodied AI.

Abstract: Recent progress in zero-shot 6D object pose estimation has been driven largely by large-scale models and cloud-based inference. However, these approaches often introduce high latency, elevated energy consumption, and deployment risks related to connectivity, cost, and data governance; factors that conflict with the practical constraints of real-world robotics, where compute is limited and on-device inference is frequently required. We introduce Geo6DPose, a lightweight, fully local, and training-free pipeline for zero-shot 6D pose estimation that trades model scale for geometric reliability. Our method combines foundation model visual features with a geometric filtering strategy: Similarity maps are computed between onboarded template DINO descriptors and scene patches, and mutual correspondences are established by projecting scene patch centers to 3D and template descriptors to the object model coordinate system. Final poses are recovered via correspondence-driven RANSAC and ranked using a weighted geometric alignment metric that jointly accounts for reprojection consistency and spatial support, improving robustness to noise, clutter, and partial visibility. Geo6DPose achieves sub-second inference on a single commodity GPU while matching the average recall of significantly larger zero-shot baselines (53.7 AR, 1.08 FPS). It requires no training, fine-tuning, or network access, and remains compatible with evolving foundation backbones, advancing practical, fully local 6D perception for robotic deployment.

Abstract: Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) allows reconstructing biology-relevant structures beyond the diffraction limit by detecting and localizing individual fluorophores -- fluorescent molecules stained onto the observed specimen -- over time to reconstruct super-resolved images. Currently, efficient SMLM requires non-overlapping emitting fluorophores, leading to long acquisition times that hinders live-cell imaging. Recent deep-learning approaches can handle denser emissions, but they rely on variants of non-maximum suppression (NMS) layers, which are unfortunately non-differentiable and may discard true positives with their local fusion strategy. In this presentation, we reformulate the SMLM training objective as a set-matching problem, deriving an optimal-transport loss that eliminates the need for NMS during inference and enables end-to-end training. Additionally, we propose an iterative neural network that integrates knowledge of the microscope's optical system inside our model. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real biological data show that both our new loss function and architecture surpass the state of the art at moderate and high emitter densities.

Abstract: We present SHARP, an approach to photorealistic view synthesis from a single image. Given a single photograph, SHARP regresses the parameters of a 3D Gaussian representation of the depicted scene. This is done in less than a second on a standard GPU via a single feedforward pass through a neural network. The 3D Gaussian representation produced by SHARP can then be rendered in real time, yielding high-resolution photorealistic images for nearby views. The representation is metric, with absolute scale, supporting metric camera movements. Experimental results demonstrate that SHARP delivers robust zero-shot generalization across datasets. It sets a new state of the art on multiple datasets, reducing LPIPS by 25-34% and DISTS by 21-43% versus the best prior model, while lowering the synthesis time by three orders of magnitude.

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is essential for the safe clinical deployment of medical image segmentation systems, enabling the identification of unreliable predictions and supporting human oversight. While prior work has largely focused on pixel-level uncertainty, landmark-based segmentation offers inherent topological guarantees yet remains underexplored from an uncertainty perspective. In this work, we study uncertainty estimation for anatomical landmark-based segmentation on chest X-rays. Inspired by hybrid neural network architectures that combine standard image convolutional encoders with graph-based generative decoders, and leveraging their variational latent space, we derive two complementary measures: (i) latent uncertainty, captured directly from the learned distribution parameters, and (ii) predictive uncertainty, obtained by generating multiple stochastic output predictions from latent samples. Through controlled corruption experiments we show that both uncertainty measures increase with perturbation severity, reflecting both global and local degradation. We demonstrate that these uncertainty signals can identify unreliable predictions by comparing with manual ground-truth, and support out-of-distribution detection on the CheXmask dataset. More importantly, we release CheXmask-U (huggingface.co/datasets/mcosarinsky/CheXmask-U), a large scale dataset of 657,566 chest X-ray landmark segmentations with per-node uncertainty estimates, enabling researchers to account for spatial variations in segmentation quality when using these anatomical masks. Our findings establish uncertainty estimation as a promising direction to enhance robustness and safe deployment of landmark-based anatomical segmentation methods in chest X-ray. A fully working interactive demo of the method is available at huggingface.co/spaces/matiasky/CheXmask-U and the source code at github.com/mcosarinsky/CheXmask-U.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving methods built on vision language models (VLMs) have undergone rapid development driven by their universal visual understanding and strong reasoning capabilities obtained from the large-scale pretraining. However, we find that current VLMs struggle to understand fine-grained 3D spatial relationships which is a fundamental requirement for systems interacting with the physical world. To address this issue, we propose SpaceDrive, a spatial-aware VLM-based driving framework that treats spatial information as explicit positional encodings (PEs) instead of textual digit tokens, enabling joint reasoning over semantic and spatial representations. SpaceDrive employs a universal positional encoder to all 3D coordinates derived from multi-view depth estimation, historical ego-states, and text prompts. These 3D PEs are first superimposed to augment the corresponding 2D visual tokens. Meanwhile, they serve as a task-agnostic coordinate representation, replacing the digit-wise numerical tokens as both inputs and outputs for the VLM. This mechanism enables the model to better index specific visual semantics in spatial reasoning and directly regress trajectory coordinates rather than generating digit-by-digit, thereby enhancing planning accuracy. Extensive experiments validate that SpaceDrive achieves state-of-the-art open-loop performance on the nuScenes dataset and the second-best Driving Score of 78.02 on the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark over existing VLM-based methods.

Abstract: Depth estimation in videos is essential for visual perception in real-world applications. However, existing methods either rely on simple frame-by-frame monocular models, leading to temporal inconsistencies and inaccuracies, or use computationally demanding temporal modeling, unsuitable for real-time applications. These limitations significantly restrict general applicability and performance in practical settings. To address this, we propose VeloDepth, an efficient and robust online video depth estimation pipeline that effectively leverages spatiotemporal priors from previous depth predictions and performs deep feature propagation. Our method introduces a novel Propagation Module that refines and propagates depth features and predictions using flow-based warping coupled with learned residual corrections. In addition, our design structurally enforces temporal consistency, resulting in stable depth predictions across consecutive frames with improved efficiency. Comprehensive zero-shot evaluation on multiple benchmarks demonstrates the state-of-the-art temporal consistency and competitive accuracy of VeloDepth, alongside its significantly faster inference compared to existing video-based depth estimators. VeloDepth thus provides a practical, efficient, and accurate solution for real-time depth estimation suitable for diverse perception tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in motion-aware large language models have shown remarkable promise for unifying motion understanding and generation tasks. However, these models typically treat understanding and generation separately, limiting the mutual benefits that could arise from interactive feedback between tasks. In this work, we reveal that motion assessment and refinement tasks act as crucial bridges to enable bidirectional knowledge flow between understanding and generation. Leveraging this insight, we propose Interleaved Reasoning for Motion Generation (IRMoGen), a novel paradigm that tightly couples motion generation with assessment and refinement through iterative text-motion dialogue. To realize this, we introduce IRG-MotionLLM, the first model that seamlessly interleaves motion generation, assessment, and refinement to improve generation performance. IRG-MotionLLM is developed progressively with a novel three-stage training scheme, initializing and subsequently enhancing native IRMoGen capabilities. To facilitate this development, we construct an automated data engine to synthesize interleaved reasoning annotations from existing text-motion datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: (i) Assessment and refinement tasks significantly improve text-motion alignment; (ii) Interleaving motion generation, assessment, and refinement steps yields consistent performance gains across training stages; and (iii) IRG-MotionLLM clearly outperforms the baseline model and achieves advanced performance on standard text-to-motion generation benchmarks. Cross-evaluator testing further validates its effectiveness. Code & Data: https://github.com/HumanMLLM/IRG-MotionLLM/tree/main.

Abstract: Colonoscopic polyp diagnosis is pivotal for early colorectal cancer detection, yet traditional automated reporting suffers from inconsistencies and hallucinations due to the scarcity of high-quality multimodal medical data. To bridge this gap, we propose LDP, a novel framework leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for professional polyp diagnosis report generation. Specifically, we curate MMEndo, a multimodal endoscopic dataset comprising expert-annotated colonoscopy image-text pairs. We fine-tune the Qwen2-VL-7B backbone using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (LoRA) and align it with clinical standards via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Extensive experiments show that our LDP outperforms existing baselines on both automated metrics and rigorous clinical expert evaluations (achieving a Physician Score of 7.2/10), significantly reducing training computational costs by 833x compared to full fine-tuning. The proposed solution offers a scalable, clinically viable path for primary healthcare, with additional validation on the IU-XRay dataset confirming its robustness.

Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based simulation of coronary blood flow provides valuable hemodynamic markers, such as pressure gradients, for diagnosing coronary artery disease (CAD). However, CFD is computationally expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to integrate into large-scale clinical workflows. These limitations restrict the availability of labeled hemodynamic data for training AI models and hinder broad adoption of non-invasive, physiology based CAD assessment. To address these challenges, we develop an end to end pipeline that automates coronary geometry extraction from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), streamlines simulation data generation, and enables efficient learning of coronary blood pressure distributions. The pipeline reduces the manual burden associated with traditional CFD workflows while producing consistent training data. We further introduce a diffusion-based regression model designed to predict coronary blood pressure directly from CCTA derived features, bypassing the need for slow CFD computation during inference. Evaluated on a dataset of simulated coronary hemodynamics, the proposed model achieves state of the art performance, with an R2 of 64.42%, a root mean squared error of 0.0974, and a normalized RMSE of 0.154, outperforming several baseline approaches. This work provides a scalable and accessible framework for rapid, non-invasive blood pressure prediction to support CAD diagnosis.

Abstract: Prostate cancer grading from whole-slide images (WSIs) remains a challenging task due to the large-scale nature of WSIs, the presence of heterogeneous tissue structures, and difficulty of selecting diagnostically relevant regions. Existing approaches often rely on random or static patch selection, leading to the inclusion of redundant or non-informative regions that degrade performance. To address this, we propose a Graph Laplacian Attention-Based Transformer (GLAT) integrated with an Iterative Refinement Module (IRM) to enhance both feature learning and spatial consistency. The IRM iteratively refines patch selection by leveraging a pretrained ResNet50 for local feature extraction and a foundation model in no-gradient mode for importance scoring, ensuring only the most relevant tissue regions are preserved. The GLAT models tissue-level connectivity by constructing a graph where patches serve as nodes, ensuring spatial consistency through graph Laplacian constraints and refining feature representations via a learnable filtering mechanism that enhances discriminative histological structures. Additionally, a convex aggregation mechanism dynamically adjusts patch importance to generate a robust WSI-level representation. Extensive experiments on five public and one private dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher performance and spatial consistency while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: While computer vision and machine learning have made great progress, their robustness is still challenged by two key issues: data distribution shift and label noise. When domain generalization (DG) encounters noise, noisy labels further exacerbate the emergence of spurious features in deep layers, i.e. spurious feature enlargement, leading to a degradation in the performance of existing algorithms. This paper, starting from domain generalization, explores how to make existing methods rework when meeting noise. We find that the latent features inside the model have certain discriminative capabilities, and different latent features focus on different parts of the image. Based on these observations, we propose the Self-Ensemble Post Learning approach (SEPL) to diversify features which can be leveraged. Specifically, SEPL consists of two parts: feature probing training and prediction ensemble inference. It leverages intermediate feature representations within the model architecture, training multiple probing classifiers to fully exploit the capabilities of pre-trained models, while the final predictions are obtained through the integration of outputs from these diverse classification heads. Considering the presence of noisy labels, we employ semi-supervised algorithms to train probing classifiers. Given that different probing classifiers focus on different areas, we integrate their predictions using a crowdsourcing inference approach. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method not only enhances the robustness of existing methods but also exhibits significant potential for real-world applications with high flexibility.

Abstract: 6D object pose estimation, which predicts the transformation of an object relative to the camera, remains challenging for unseen objects. Existing approaches typically rely on explicitly constructing feature correspondences between the query image and either the object model or template images. In this work, we propose PoseGAM, a geometry-aware multi-view framework that directly predicts object pose from a query image and multiple template images, eliminating the need for explicit matching. Built upon recent multi-view-based foundation model architectures, the method integrates object geometry information through two complementary mechanisms: explicit point-based geometry and learned features from geometry representation networks. In addition, we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset containing more than 190k objects under diverse environmental conditions to enhance robustness and generalization. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance, yielding an average AR improvement of 5.1% over prior methods and achieving up to 17.6% gains on individual datasets, indicating strong generalization to unseen objects.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in 4D content generation, the conversion of monocular videos into high-quality animated 3D assets with explicit 4D meshes remains considerably challenging. The scarcity of large-scale, naturally captured 4D mesh datasets further limits the ability to train generalizable video-to-4D models from scratch in a purely data-driven manner. Meanwhile, advances in image-to-3D generation, supported by extensive datasets, offer powerful prior models that can be leveraged. To better utilize these priors while minimizing reliance on 4D supervision, we introduce SWiT-4D, a Sliding-Window Transformer for lossless, parameter-free temporal 4D mesh generation. SWiT-4D integrates seamlessly with any Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based image-to-3D generator, adding spatial-temporal modeling across video frames while preserving the original single-image forward process, enabling 4D mesh reconstruction from videos of arbitrary length. To recover global translation, we further introduce an optimization-based trajectory module tailored for static-camera monocular videos. SWiT-4D demonstrates strong data efficiency: with only a single short (<10s) video for fine-tuning, it achieves high-fidelity geometry and stable temporal consistency, indicating practical deployability under extremely limited 4D supervision. Comprehensive experiments on both in-domain zoo-test sets and challenging out-of-domain benchmarks (C4D, Objaverse, and in-the-wild videos) show that SWiT-4D consistently outperforms existing baselines in temporal smoothness.

Abstract: Spatial understanding over continuous visual input is crucial for MLLMs to evolve into general-purpose assistants in physical environments. Yet there is still no comprehensive benchmark that holistically assesses the progress toward this goal. In this work, we introduce MMSI-Video-Bench, a fully human-annotated benchmark for video-based spatial intelligence in MLLMs. It operationalizes a four-level framework, Perception, Planning, Prediction, and Cross-Video Reasoning, through 1,106 questions grounded in 1,278 clips from 25 datasets and in-house videos. Each item is carefully designed and reviewed by 3DV experts with explanatory rationales to ensure precise, unambiguous grounding. Leveraging its diverse data sources and holistic task coverage, MMSI-Video-Bench also supports three domain-oriented sub-benchmarks (Indoor Scene Perception Bench, Robot Bench and Grounding Bench) for targeted capability assessment. We evaluate 25 strong open-source and proprietary MLLMs, revealing a striking human--AI gap: many models perform near chance, and the best reasoning model lags humans by nearly 60%. We further find that spatially fine-tuned models still fail to generalize effectively on our benchmark. Fine-grained error analysis exposes systematic failures in geometric reasoning, motion grounding, long-horizon prediction, and cross-video correspondence. We also show that typical frame-sampling strategies transfer poorly to our reasoning-intensive benchmark, and that neither 3D spatial cues nor chain-of-thought prompting yields meaningful gains. We expect our benchmark to establish a solid testbed for advancing video-based spatial intelligence.

Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of Microscopic Spatial Intelligence (MiSI), the capability to perceive and reason about the spatial relationships of invisible microscopic entities, which is fundamental to scientific discovery. To assess the potential of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in this domain, we propose a systematic benchmark framework MiSI-Bench. This framework features over 163,000 question-answer pairs and 587,000 images derived from approximately 4,000 molecular structures, covering nine complementary tasks that evaluate abilities ranging from elementary spatial transformations to complex relational identifications. Experimental results reveal that current state-of-the-art VLMs perform significantly below human level on this benchmark. However, a fine-tuned 7B model demonstrates substantial potential, even surpassing humans in spatial transformation tasks, while its poor performance in scientifically-grounded tasks like hydrogen bond recognition underscores the necessity of integrating explicit domain knowledge for progress toward scientific AGI.

Abstract: Motion capture now underpins content creation far beyond digital humans, yet most existing pipelines remain species- or template-specific. We formalize this gap as Category-Agnostic Motion Capture (CAMoCap): given a monocular video and an arbitrary rigged 3D asset as a prompt, the goal is to reconstruct a rotation-based animation such as BVH that directly drives the specific asset. We present MoCapAnything, a reference-guided, factorized framework that first predicts 3D joint trajectories and then recovers asset-specific rotations via constraint-aware inverse kinematics. The system contains three learnable modules and a lightweight IK stage: (1) a Reference Prompt Encoder that extracts per-joint queries from the asset's skeleton, mesh, and rendered images; (2) a Video Feature Extractor that computes dense visual descriptors and reconstructs a coarse 4D deforming mesh to bridge the gap between video and joint space; and (3) a Unified Motion Decoder that fuses these cues to produce temporally coherent trajectories. We also curate Truebones Zoo with 1038 motion clips, each providing a standardized skeleton-mesh-render triad. Experiments on both in-domain benchmarks and in-the-wild videos show that MoCapAnything delivers high-quality skeletal animations and exhibits meaningful cross-species retargeting across heterogeneous rigs, enabling scalable, prompt-driven 3D motion capture for arbitrary assets.

Abstract: Table extraction (TE) is a key challenge in visual document understanding. Traditional approaches detect tables first, then recognize their structure. Recently, interest has surged in developing methods, such as vision-language models (VLMs), that can extract tables directly in their full page or document context. However, progress has been difficult to demonstrate due to a lack of annotated data. To address this, we create a new large-scale dataset, PubTables-v2. PubTables-v2 supports a number of current challenging table extraction tasks. Notably, it is the first large-scale benchmark for multi-page table structure recognition. We demonstrate its usefulness by evaluating domain-specialized VLMs on these tasks and highlighting current progress. Finally, we use PubTables-v2 to create the Page-Object Table Transformer (POTATR), an image-to-graph extension of the Table Transformer to comprehensive page-level TE. Data, code, and trained models will be released.

Abstract: Recent vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches have achieved impressive results on SVG generation.

We introduce DuetSVG, a unified multimodal model that jointly generates image tokens and corresponding SVG tokens in an end-to-end manner. DuetSVG is trained on both image and SVG datasets. At inference, we apply a novel test-time scaling strategy that leverages the model's native visual predictions as guidance to improve SVG decoding quality. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods, producing visually faithful, semantically aligned, and syntactically clean SVGs across a wide range of applications.

Abstract: Motion understanding is fundamental to physical reasoning, enabling models to infer dynamics and predict future states. However, state-of-the-art models still struggle on recent motion benchmarks, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale, fine-grained motion datasets. Existing motion datasets are often constructed from costly manual annotation, severely limiting scalability. To address this challenge, we introduce FoundationMotion, a fully automated data curation pipeline that constructs large-scale motion datasets. Our approach first detects and tracks objects in videos to extract their trajectories, then leverages these trajectories and video frames with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate fine-grained captions and diverse question-answer pairs about motion and spatial reasoning. Using datasets produced by this pipeline, we fine-tune open-source models including NVILA-Video-15B and Qwen2.5-7B, achieving substantial improvements in motion understanding without compromising performance on other tasks. Notably, our models outperform strong closed-source baselines like Gemini-2.5 Flash and large open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL-72B across diverse motion understanding datasets and benchmarks. FoundationMotion thus provides a scalable solution for curating fine-grained motion datasets that enable effective fine-tuning of diverse models to enhance motion understanding and spatial reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Early children's developmental trajectories set up a natural goal for sample-efficient pretraining of vision foundation models. We introduce BabyVLM-V2, a developmentally grounded framework for infant-inspired vision-language modeling that extensively improves upon BabyVLM-V1 through a longitudinal, multifaceted pretraining set, a versatile model, and, most importantly, DevCV Toolbox for cognitive evaluation. The pretraining set maximizes coverage while minimizing curation of a longitudinal, infant-centric audiovisual corpus, yielding video-utterance, image-utterance, and multi-turn conversational data that mirror infant experiences. DevCV Toolbox adapts all vision-related measures of the recently released NIH Baby Toolbox into a benchmark suite of ten multimodal tasks, covering spatial reasoning, memory, and vocabulary understanding aligned with early children's capabilities. Experimental results show that a compact model pretrained from scratch can achieve competitive performance on DevCV Toolbox, outperforming GPT-4o on some tasks. We hope the principled, unified BabyVLM-V2 framework will accelerate research in developmentally plausible pretraining of vision foundation models.

Abstract: Speech-driven talking heads have recently emerged and enable interactive avatars. However, real-world applications are limited, as current methods achieve high visual fidelity but slow or fast yet temporally unstable. Diffusion methods provide realistic image generation, yet struggle with oneshot settings. Gaussian Splatting approaches are real-time, yet inaccuracies in facial tracking, or inconsistent Gaussian mappings, lead to unstable outputs and video artifacts that are detrimental to realistic use cases. We address this problem by mapping Gaussian Splatting using 3D Morphable Models to generate person-specific avatars. We introduce transformer-based prediction of model parameters, directly from audio, to drive temporal consistency. From monocular video and independent audio speech inputs, our method enables generation of real-time talking head videos where we report competitive quantitative and qualitative performance.

Abstract: Prior approaches injecting camera control into diffusion models have focused on specific subsets of 4D consistency tasks: novel view synthesis, text-to-video with camera control, image-to-video, amongst others. Therefore, these fragmented approaches are trained on disjoint slices of available 3D/4D data. We introduce OmniView, a unified framework that generalizes across a wide range of 4D consistency tasks. Our method separately represents space, time, and view conditions, enabling flexible combinations of these inputs. For example, OmniView can synthesize novel views from static, dynamic, and multiview inputs, extrapolate trajectories forward and backward in time, and create videos from text or image prompts with full camera control. OmniView is competitive with task-specific models across diverse benchmarks and metrics, improving image quality scores among camera-conditioned diffusion models by up to 33\% in multiview NVS LLFF dataset, 60\% in dynamic NVS Neural 3D Video benchmark, 20\% in static camera control on RE-10K, and reducing camera trajectory errors by 4x in text-conditioned video generation. With strong generalizability in one model, OmniView demonstrates the feasibility of a generalist 4D video model. Project page is available at https://snap-research.github.io/OmniView/

Abstract: Reasoning goes beyond language; the real world requires reasoning about space, time, affordances, and much more that words alone cannot convey. Existing multimodal models exploring the potential of reasoning with images are brittle and do not scale. They rely on calling specialist tools, costly generation of images, or handcrafted reasoning data to switch between text and image thoughts. Instead, we offer a simpler alternative -- Mull-Tokens -- modality-agnostic latent tokens pre-trained to hold intermediate information in either image or text modalities to let the model think free-form towards the correct answer. We investigate best practices to train Mull-Tokens inspired by latent reasoning frameworks. We first train Mull-Tokens using supervision from interleaved text-image traces, and then fine-tune without any supervision by only using the final answers. Across four challenging spatial reasoning benchmarks involving tasks such as solving puzzles and taking different perspectives, we demonstrate that Mull-Tokens improve upon several baselines utilizing text-only reasoning or interleaved image-text reasoning, achieving a +3% average improvement and up to +16% on a puzzle solving reasoning-heavy split compared to our strongest baseline. Adding to conversations around challenges in grounding textual and visual reasoning, Mull-Tokens offers a simple solution to abstractly think in multiple modalities.

Abstract: We introduce VL-JEPA, a vision-language model built on a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA). Instead of autoregressively generating tokens as in classical VLMs, VL-JEPA predicts continuous embeddings of the target texts. By learning in an abstract representation space, the model focuses on task-relevant semantics while abstracting away surface-level linguistic variability. In a strictly controlled comparison against standard token-space VLM training with the same vision encoder and training data, VL-JEPA achieves stronger performance while having 50% fewer trainable parameters. At inference time, a lightweight text decoder is invoked only when needed to translate VL-JEPA predicted embeddings into text. We show that VL-JEPA natively supports selective decoding that reduces the number of decoding operations by 2.85x while maintaining similar performance compared to non-adaptive uniform decoding. Beyond generation, the VL-JEPA's embedding space naturally supports open-vocabulary classification, text-to-video retrieval, and discriminative VQA without any architecture modification. On eight video classification and eight video retrieval datasets, the average performance VL-JEPA surpasses that of CLIP, SigLIP2, and Perception Encoder. At the same time, the model achieves comparable performance as classical VLMs (InstructBLIP, QwenVL) on four VQA datasets: GQA, TallyQA, POPE and POPEv2, despite only having 1.6B parameters.

Abstract: Recent advances in subject-driven video generation with large diffusion models have enabled personalized content synthesis conditioned on user-provided subjects. However, existing methods lack fine-grained temporal control over subject appearance and disappearance, which are essential for applications such as compositional video synthesis, storyboarding, and controllable animation. We propose AlcheMinT, a unified framework that introduces explicit timestamps conditioning for subject-driven video generation. Our approach introduces a novel positional encoding mechanism that unlocks the encoding of temporal intervals, associated in our case with subject identities, while seamlessly integrating with the pretrained video generation model positional embeddings. Additionally, we incorporate subject-descriptive text tokens to strengthen binding between visual identity and video captions, mitigating ambiguity during generation. Through token-wise concatenation, AlcheMinT avoids any additional cross-attention modules and incurs negligible parameter overhead. We establish a benchmark evaluating multiple subject identity preservation, video fidelity, and temporal adherence. Experimental results demonstrate that AlcheMinT achieves visual quality matching state-of-the-art video personalization methods, while, for the first time, enabling precise temporal control over multi-subject generation within videos.

Abstract: This paper proposes a large-scale multi-modal dataset for referring motion expression video segmentation, focusing on segmenting and tracking target objects in videos based on language description of objects' motions. Existing referring video segmentation datasets often focus on salient objects and use language expressions rich in static attributes, potentially allowing the target object to be identified in a single frame. Such datasets underemphasize the role of motion in both videos and languages. To explore the feasibility of using motion expressions and motion reasoning clues for pixel-level video understanding, we introduce MeViS, a dataset containing 33,072 human-annotated motion expressions in both text and audio, covering 8,171 objects in 2,006 videos of complex scenarios. We benchmark 15 existing methods across 4 tasks supported by MeViS, including 6 referring video object segmentation (RVOS) methods, 3 audio-guided video object segmentation (AVOS) methods, 2 referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) methods, and 4 video captioning methods for the newly introduced referring motion expression generation (RMEG) task. The results demonstrate weaknesses and limitations of existing methods in addressing motion expression-guided video understanding. We further analyze the challenges and propose an approach LMPM++ for RVOS/AVOS/RMOT that achieves new state-of-the-art results. Our dataset provides a platform that facilitates the development of motion expression-guided video understanding algorithms in complex video scenes.

Abstract: We present Flex, an efficient and effective scene encoder that addresses the computational bottleneck of processing high-volume multi-camera data in end-to-end autonomous driving. Flex employs a small set of learnable scene tokens to jointly encode information from all image tokens across different cameras and timesteps. By design, our approach is geometry-agnostic, learning a compact scene representation directly from data without relying on the explicit 3D inductive biases, such as Bird-Eye-View (BEV), occupancy or tri-plane representations, which are common in prior work. This holistic encoding strategy aggressively compresses the visual input for the downstream Large Language Model (LLM) based policy model. Evaluated on a large-scale proprietary dataset of 20,000 driving hours, our Flex achieves 2.2x greater inference throughput while improving driving performance by a large margin compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we show that these compact scene tokens develop an emergent capability for scene decomposition without any explicit supervision. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that 3D priors are necessary, demonstrating that a data-driven, joint encoding strategy offers a more scalable, efficient and effective path for future autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) aims to recover high-quality images from diverse degradations within a unified framework. However, existing methods often fail to explicitly model degradation types and struggle to adapt their restoration behavior to complex or mixed degradations. To address these issues, we propose ClusIR, a Cluster-Guided Image Restoration framework that explicitly models degradation semantics through learnable clustering and propagates cluster-aware cues across spatial and frequency domains for adaptive restoration. Specifically, ClusIR comprises two key components: a Probabilistic Cluster-Guided Routing Mechanism (PCGRM) and a Degradation-Aware Frequency Modulation Module (DAFMM). The proposed PCGRM disentangles degradation recognition from expert activation, enabling discriminative degradation perception and stable expert routing. Meanwhile, DAFMM leverages the cluster-guided priors to perform adaptive frequency decomposition and targeted modulation, collaboratively refining structural and textural representations for higher restoration fidelity. The cluster-guided synergy seamlessly bridges semantic cues with frequency-domain modulation, empowering ClusIR to attain remarkable restoration results across a wide range of degradations. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks validate that ClusIR reaches competitive performance under several scenarios.

Abstract: Self-supervised pre-training has revolutionized foundation models for languages, individual 2D images and videos, but remains largely unexplored for learning 3D-aware representations from multi-view images. In this paper, we present E-RayZer, a self-supervised large 3D Vision model that learns truly 3D-aware representations directly from unlabeled images. Unlike prior self-supervised methods such as RayZer that infer 3D indirectly through latent-space view synthesis, E-RayZer operates directly in 3D space, performing self-supervised 3D reconstruction with Explicit geometry. This formulation eliminates shortcut solutions and yields representations that are geometrically grounded. To ensure convergence and scalability, we introduce a novel fine-grained learning curriculum that organizes training from easy to hard samples and harmonizes heterogeneous data sources in an entirely unsupervised manner. Experiments demonstrate that E-RayZer significantly outperforms RayZer on pose estimation, matches or sometimes surpasses fully supervised reconstruction models such as VGGT. Furthermore, its learned representations outperform leading visual pre-training models (e.g., DINOv3, CroCo v2, VideoMAE V2, and RayZer) when transferring to 3D downstream tasks, establishing E-RayZer as a new paradigm for 3D-aware visual pre-training.

Abstract: In this work, we explore an untapped signal in diffusion model inference. While all previous methods generate images independently at inference, we instead ask if samples can be generated collaboratively. We propose Group Diffusion, unlocking the attention mechanism to be shared across images, rather than limited to just the patches within an image. This enables images to be jointly denoised at inference time, learning both intra and inter-image correspondence. We observe a clear scaling effect - larger group sizes yield stronger cross-sample attention and better generation quality. Furthermore, we introduce a qualitative measure to capture this behavior and show that its strength closely correlates with FID. Built on standard diffusion transformers, our GroupDiff achieves up to 32.2% FID improvement on ImageNet-256x256. Our work reveals cross-sample inference as an effective, previously unexplored mechanism for generative modeling.

Abstract: Visual concept personalization aims to transfer only specific image attributes, such as identity, expression, lighting, and style, into unseen contexts. However, existing methods rely on holistic embeddings from general-purpose image encoders, which entangle multiple visual factors and make it difficult to isolate a single attribute. This often leads to information leakage and incoherent synthesis. To address this limitation, we introduce Omni-Attribute, the first open-vocabulary image attribute encoder designed to learn high-fidelity, attribute-specific representations. Our approach jointly designs the data and model: (i) we curate semantically linked image pairs annotated with positive and negative attributes to explicitly teach the encoder what to preserve or suppress; and (ii) we adopt a dual-objective training paradigm that balances generative fidelity with contrastive disentanglement. The resulting embeddings prove effective for open-vocabulary attribute retrieval, personalization, and compositional generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: The success of foundation models in language and vision motivated research in fully end-to-end robot navigation foundation models (NFMs). NFMs directly map monocular visual input to control actions and ignore mid-level vision modules (tracking, depth estimation, etc) entirely. While the assumption that vision capabilities will emerge implicitly is compelling, it requires large amounts of pixel-to-action supervision that are difficult to obtain. The challenge is especially pronounced in dynamic and unstructured settings, where robust navigation requires precise geometric and dynamic understanding, while the depth-scale ambiguity in monocular views further limits accurate spatial reasoning. In this paper, we show that relying on monocular vision and ignoring mid-level vision priors is inefficient.
  We present StereoWalker, which augments NFMs with stereo inputs and explicit mid-level vision such as depth estimation and dense pixel tracking. Our intuition is straightforward: stereo inputs resolve the depth-scale ambiguity, and modern mid-level vision models provide reliable geometric and motion structure in dynamic scenes. We also curate a large stereo navigation dataset with automatic action annotation from Internet stereo videos to support training of StereoWalker and to facilitate future research. Through our experiments, we find that mid-level vision enables StereoWalker to achieve a comparable performance as the state-of-the-art using only 1.5% of the training data, and surpasses the state-of-the-art using the full data. We also observe that stereo vision yields higher navigation performance than monocular input.

Abstract: We propose a decoupled 3D scene generation framework called SceneMaker in this work. Due to the lack of sufficient open-set de-occlusion and pose estimation priors, existing methods struggle to simultaneously produce high-quality geometry and accurate poses under severe occlusion and open-set settings. To address these issues, we first decouple the de-occlusion model from 3D object generation, and enhance it by leveraging image datasets and collected de-occlusion datasets for much more diverse open-set occlusion patterns. Then, we propose a unified pose estimation model that integrates global and local mechanisms for both self-attention and cross-attention to improve accuracy. Besides, we construct an open-set 3D scene dataset to further extend the generalization of the pose estimation model. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our decoupled framework on both indoor and open-set scenes. Our codes and datasets is released at https://idea-research.github.io/SceneMaker/.

Abstract: Generative world models are reshaping embodied AI, enabling agents to synthesize realistic 4D driving environments that look convincing but often fail physically or behaviorally. Despite rapid progress, the field still lacks a unified way to assess whether generated worlds preserve geometry, obey physics, or support reliable control. We introduce WorldLens, a full-spectrum benchmark evaluating how well a model builds, understands, and behaves within its generated world. It spans five aspects -- Generation, Reconstruction, Action-Following, Downstream Task, and Human Preference -- jointly covering visual realism, geometric consistency, physical plausibility, and functional reliability. Across these dimensions, no existing world model excels universally: those with strong textures often violate physics, while geometry-stable ones lack behavioral fidelity. To align objective metrics with human judgment, we further construct WorldLens-26K, a large-scale dataset of human-annotated videos with numerical scores and textual rationales, and develop WorldLens-Agent, an evaluation model distilled from these annotations to enable scalable, explainable scoring. Together, the benchmark, dataset, and agent form a unified ecosystem for measuring world fidelity -- standardizing how future models are judged not only by how real they look, but by how real they behave.

Abstract: We introduce StereoSpace, a diffusion-based framework for monocular-to-stereo synthesis that models geometry purely through viewpoint conditioning, without explicit depth or warping. A canonical rectified space and the conditioning guide the generator to infer correspondences and fill disocclusions end-to-end. To ensure fair and leakage-free evaluation, we introduce an end-to-end protocol that excludes any ground truth or proxy geometry estimates at test time. The protocol emphasizes metrics reflecting downstream relevance: iSQoE for perceptual comfort and MEt3R for geometric consistency. StereoSpace surpasses other methods from the warp & inpaint, latent-warping, and warped-conditioning categories, achieving sharp parallax and strong robustness on layered and non-Lambertian scenes. This establishes viewpoint-conditioned diffusion as a scalable, depth-free solution for stereo generation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This article looks at how reasoning works in current Large Language Models (LLMs) that function using the token-completion method. It examines their stochastic nature and their similarity to human abductive reasoning. The argument is that these LLMs create text based on learned patterns rather than performing actual abductive reasoning. When their output seems abductive, this is largely because they are trained on human-generated texts that include reasoning structures. Examples are used to show how LLMs can produce plausible ideas, mimic commonsense reasoning, and give explanatory answers without being grounded in truth, semantics, verification, or understanding, and without performing any real abductive reasoning. This dual nature, where the models have a stochastic base but appear abductive in use, has important consequences for how LLMs are evaluated and applied. They can assist with generating ideas and supporting human thinking, but their outputs must be critically assessed because they cannot identify truth or verify their explanations. The article concludes by addressing five objections to these points, noting some limitations in the analysis, and offering an overall evaluation.

Abstract: We explore the use of small language models (SLMs) for automatic question generation as a complement to the prevalent use of their large counterparts in learning analytics research. We present a novel question generation pipeline that leverages both the text generation and the probabilistic reasoning abilities of SLMs to generate high-quality questions. Adopting a "generate-then-validate" strategy, our pipeline first performs expansive generation to create an abundance of candidate questions and refine them through selective validation based on novel probabilistic reasoning. We conducted two evaluation studies, one with seven human experts and the other with a large language model (LLM), to assess the quality of the generated questions. Most judges (humans or LLMs) agreed that the generated questions had clear answers and generally aligned well with the intended learning objectives. Our findings suggest that an SLM can effectively generate high-quality questions when guided by a well-designed pipeline that leverages its strengths.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Central to long-form text generation in vertical domains is the "impossible trinity" confronting current large language models (LLMs): the simultaneous achievement of low hallucination, deep logical coherence, and personalized expression. This study establishes that this bottleneck arises from existing generative paradigms succumbing to the Statistical Smoothing Trap, a phenomenon that overlooks the high-entropy information acquisition and structured cognitive processes integral to expert-level writing. To address this limitation, we propose the DeepNews Framework, an agentic workflow that explicitly models the implicit cognitive processes of seasoned financial journalists. The framework integrates three core modules: first, a dual-granularity retrieval mechanism grounded in information foraging theory, which enforces a 10:1 saturated information input ratio to mitigate hallucinatory outputs; second, schema-guided strategic planning, a process leveraging domain expert knowledge bases (narrative schemas) and Atomic Blocks to forge a robust logical skeleton; third, adversarial constraint prompting, a technique deploying tactics including Rhythm Break and Logic Fog to disrupt the probabilistic smoothness inherent in model-generated text. Experiments delineate a salient Knowledge Cliff in deep financial reporting: content truthfulness collapses when retrieved context falls below 15,000 characters, while a high-redundancy input exceeding 30,000 characters stabilizes the Hallucination-Free Rate (HFR) above 85%. In an ecological validity blind test conducted with a top-tier Chinese technology media outlet, the DeepNews system--built on a previous-generation model (DeepSeek-V3-0324)-achieved a 25% submission acceptance rate, significantly outperforming the 0% acceptance rate of zero-shot generation by a state-of-the-art (SOTA) model (GPT-5).

Abstract: Personalized review response generation presents a significant challenge in domains where user information is limited, such as food delivery platforms. While large language models (LLMs) offer powerful text generation capabilities, they often produce generic responses when lacking contextual user data, reducing engagement and effectiveness. In this work, we propose a two-stage prompting framework that infers both explicit (e.g., user-stated preferences) and implicit (e.g., demographic or stylistic cues) personas directly from short review texts. These inferred persona attributes are then incorporated into the response generation prompt to produce user-tailored replies. To encourage diverse yet faithful generations, we adjust decoding temperature during inference. We evaluate our method using a real-world dataset collected from a Korean food delivery app, and assess its impact on precision, diversity, and semantic consistency. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of persona-augmented prompting in enhancing the relevance and personalization of automated responses without requiring model fine-tuning.

Abstract: The safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important with their democratization. In this paper, we study the safety degradation that comes with adapting LLMs to new tasks. We attribute this safety compromise to catastrophic forgetting and frame the problem of preserving safety when fine-tuning as a continual learning (CL) problem. We consider the fine-tuning-as-a-service setup where the user uploads their data to a service provider to get a customized model that excels on the user's selected task. We adapt several CL approaches from the literature and systematically evaluate their ability to mitigate safety degradation. These include regularization-based, memory-based, and model merging approaches. We consider two scenarios, (1) benign user data and (2) poisoned user data. Our results demonstrate that CL approaches consistently achieve lower attack success rates than standard fine-tuning. Among these, DER outperforms both other CL methods and existing safety-preserving baselines while maintaining task utility. These findings generalize across three downstream tasks (GSM8K, SST2, Code) and three model families (LLaMA2-7B, Mistral-7B, Gemma-2B), establishing CL as a practical solution to preserve safety.

Abstract: This article presents experiments performed using a computational laboratory environment for language acquisition experiments. It implements a multi-agent system consisting of two agents: an adult language model and a daughter language model that aims to learn the mother language. Crucially, the daughter agent does not have access to the internal knowledge of the mother language model but only to the language exemplars the mother agent generates. These experiments illustrate how this system can be used to acquire abstract grammatical knowledge. We demonstrate how statistical analyses of patterns in the input data corresponding to grammatical categories yield discrete grammatical rules. These rules are subsequently added to the grammatical knowledge of the daughter language model. To this end, hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis was applied to the utterances consecutively generated by the mother language model. It is argued that this procedure can be used to acquire structures resembling grammatical categories proposed by linguists for natural languages. Thus, it is established that non-trivial grammatical knowledge has been acquired. Moreover, the parameter configuration of this computational laboratory environment determined using training data generated by the mother language model is validated in a second experiment with a test set similarly resulting in the acquisition of non-trivial categories.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) has recently emerged as a critical issue for safe and trustworthy application of LLMs in the medical domain. Although a variety of static medical question-answering (QA) benchmarks have been proposed, many aspects remain underexplored, such as the effectiveness of LLMs in generating responses in dynamic, interactive clinical multi-turn conversation situations and the identification of multi-faceted evaluation strategies beyond simple accuracy. However, formally evaluating a dynamic, interactive clinical situation is hindered by its vast combinatorial space of possible patient states and interaction trajectories, making it difficult to standardize and quantitatively measure such scenarios. Here, we introduce AutoMedic, a multi-agent simulation framework that enables automated evaluation of LLMs as clinical conversational agents. AutoMedic transforms off-the-shelf static QA datasets into virtual patient profiles, enabling realistic and clinically grounded multi-turn clinical dialogues between LLM agents. The performance of various clinical conversational agents is then assessed based on our CARE metric, which provides a multi-faceted evaluation standard of clinical conversational accuracy, efficiency/strategy, empathy, and robustness. Our findings, validated by human experts, demonstrate the validity of AutoMedic as an automated evaluation framework for clinical conversational agents, offering practical guidelines for the effective development of LLMs in conversational medical applications.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has made great progress in recent years, particularly in the development of Vision--Language Models (VLMs) that understand both visual and textual data. However, these advancements remain largely limited to English, reducing their accessibility for non--English speakers. It is essential to extend these capabilities to a broader range of languages. This paper explores the challenges of adapting an English-trained VLM to different languages. To this end, we will explore and compare different methods for their performance and computational cost. We consider a translation-based pipeline, LoRA finetuning, and a two-stage finetuning strategy that separates vision adaptation from language adaptation. To evaluate these methods, we use a combination of standard multimodal benchmarks translated into the target language and manual assessments by native experts. The results reveal that dataset translation remains a major bottleneck in multilingual VLM performance, with data quality limiting the effectiveness of training and evaluation. These findings suggest that future efforts should focus on native-language dataset collection and improved translation strategies.

Abstract: Real-world AI software engineering demands coding agents that can reason over massive repositories, maintain durable memory across and within long sessions, and robustly coordinate complex toolchains at test time. Existing open-source coding agents provide transparency but frequently fall short when pushed to these industrial-scale workloads, while proprietary coding agents offer strong practical performance but limited extensibility, interpretability, and controllability. We present the Confucius Code Agent (CCA), an open-sourced AI software engineer that can operate at an industrial scale. CCA is built atop the Confucius SDK, an open-sourced agent development platform designed around three complementary perspectives: Agent Experience (AX), User Experience (UX), and Developer Experience (DX). The SDK introduces a unified orchestrator with hierarchical working memory for long-context reasoning, a persistent note-taking system for cross-session continual learning, and a modular extension module for robust tool use. Moreover, a meta-agent automates the synthesis, evaluation, and refinement of agent configurations through a build-test-improve loop, enabling rapid agent development on new tasks, environments, and tool stacks. Instantiated on Confucius SDK with these mechanisms, CCA delivers strong performance on real-world software engineering tasks. On SWE-Bench-Pro, CCA achieves a state-of-the-art Resolve@1 performance of 54.3%, substantially improving over prior coding agents. Together, the Confucius SDK and CCA provide a transparent, extensible, and reproducible foundation for AI agents, bridge gaps between research prototypes and production-grade systems, and support agent development and deployment at industrial scale.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism in Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) scales quadratically with input length, making long-context inference expensive. Sliding window attention (SWA) reduces this cost to linear complexity, but naively enabling complete SWA at inference-time for models pretrained with full attention (FA) causes severe long-context performance degradation due to training-inference mismatch. This makes us wonder: Can FA-pretrained LLMs be well adapted to SWA without pretraining? We investigate this by proposing Sliding Window Attention Adaptation (SWAA), a set of practical recipes that combine five methods for better adaptation: (1) applying SWA only during prefilling; (2) preserving "sink" tokens; (3) interleaving FA/SWA layers; (4) chain-of-thought (CoT); and (5) fine-tuning. Our experiments show that SWA adaptation is feasible while non-trivial: no single method suffices, yet specific synergistic combinations effectively recover the original long-context performance. We further analyze the performance-efficiency trade-offs of different SWAA configurations and provide recommended recipes for diverse scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/yuyijiong/sliding-window-attention-adaptation

Abstract: Since large language models (LLMs) have a tendency to generate factually inaccurate output, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has gained significant attention as a key means to mitigate this downside of harnessing only LLMs. However, existing RAG methods for simple and multi-hop question answering (QA) are still prone to incorrect retrievals and hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose CoopRAG, a novel RAG framework for the question answering task in which a retriever and an LLM work cooperatively with each other by exchanging informative knowledge, and the earlier and later layers of the retriever model work cooperatively with each other to accurately rank the retrieved documents relevant to a given query. In this framework, we (i) unroll a question into sub-questions and a reasoning chain in which uncertain positions are masked, (ii) retrieve the documents relevant to the question augmented with the sub-questions and the reasoning chain, (iii) rerank the documents by contrasting layers of the retriever, and (iv) reconstruct the reasoning chain by filling the masked positions via the LLM. Our experiments demonstrate that CoopRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QA methods on three multi-hop QA datasets as well as a simple QA dataset in terms of both the retrieval and QA performances. Our code is available.\footnote{https://github.com/meaningful96/CoopRAG}

To enable reproducible and extensible research, we release the model weights, the T-Wix 500k instruction corpus, the T-Math reasoning benchmark, and the EAGLE weights on Hugging Face. These resources allow users to study Russian-language reasoning and to extend or adapt both the model and the inference pipeline. A public web demo exposes reasoning and non-reasoning modes and illustrates the speedups achieved by our inference stack across domains. T-pro 2.0 thus serves as an accessible open system for building and evaluating efficient, practical Russian LLM applications.

Abstract: The integrity and reliability of scientific literature is facing a serious threat by adversarial text generation techniques, specifically from the use of automated paraphrasing tools to mask plagiarism. These tools generate "tortured phrases", statistically improbable synonyms (e.g. "counterfeit consciousness" for "artificial intelligence"), that preserve the local grammar while obscuring the original source. Most existing detection methods depend heavily on static blocklists or general-domain language models, which suffer from high false-negative rates for novel obfuscations and cannot determine the source of the plagiarized content. In this paper, we propose Semantic Reconstruction of Adversarial Plagiarism (SRAP), a framework designed not only to detect these anomalies but to mathematically recover the original terminology. We use a two-stage architecture: (1) statistical anomaly detection with a domain-specific masked language model (SciBERT) using token-level pseudo-perplexity, and (2) source-based semantic reconstruction using dense vector retrieval (FAISS) and sentence-level alignment (SBERT). Experiments on a parallel corpus of adversarial scientific text show that while zero-shot baselines fail completely (0.00 percent restoration accuracy), our retrieval-augmented approach achieves 23.67 percent restoration accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline methods. We also show that static decision boundaries are necessary for robust detection in jargon-heavy scientific text, since dynamic thresholding fails under high variance. SRAP enables forensic analysis by linking obfuscated expressions back to their most probable source documents.

The system combines Large Language Models (LLMs), a knowledge graph-enhanced BERT (KG-BERT), and a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with attention to classify students' cognitive and affective states in real time. Unlike prior chatbots limited to either tutoring or affective support, our approach leverages multimodal data-including textual semantics, prosodic speech features, and temporal behavioral trends-to infer engagement, stress, and conceptual understanding. A pilot study with university students demonstrated improved motivation, reduced stress, and moderate academic gains compared to baseline methods. These results underline the promise of integrating semantic reasoning, multimodal fusion, and temporal modeling to support adaptive, student-centered educational interventions.

Abstract: What counts as evidence for syntactic structure? In traditional generative grammar, systematic contrasts in grammaticality such as subject-auxiliary inversion and the licensing of parasitic gaps are taken as evidence for an internal, hierarchical grammar. In this paper, we test whether large language models (LLMs), trained only on surface forms, reproduce these contrasts in ways that imply an underlying structural representation.
  We focus on two classic constructions: subject-auxiliary inversion (testing recognition of the subject boundary) and parasitic gap licensing (testing abstract dependency structure). We evaluate models including GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 using prompts eliciting acceptability ratings. Results show that LLMs reliably distinguish between grammatical and ungrammatical variants in both constructions, and as such support that they are sensitive to structure and not just linear order. Structural generalizations, distinct from cognitive knowledge, emerge from predictive training on surface forms, suggesting functional sensitivity to syntax without explicit encoding.

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive amounts of text data, primarily from a few dominant languages. Studies suggest that this over-reliance on high-resource languages, such as English, hampers LLM performance in mid- and low-resource languages. To mitigate this problem, we propose to (i) optimize the language distribution by training a small proxy model within a domain-reweighing DoGE algorithm that we extend to XDoGE for a multilingual setup, and (ii) rescale the data and train a full-size model with the established language weights either from scratch or within a continual pre-training phase (CPT). We target six languages possessing a variety of geographic and intra- and inter-language-family relations, namely, English and Spanish (high-resource), Portuguese and Catalan (mid-resource), Galician and Basque (low-resource). We experiment with Salamandra-2b, which is a promising model for these languages. We investigate the effects of substantial data repetition on minor languages and under-sampling on dominant languages using the IberoBench framework for quantitative evaluation. Finally, we release a new promising IberianLLM-7B-Instruct model centering on Iberian languages and English that we pretrained from scratch and further improved using CPT with the XDoGE weights.

Abstract: In context learning (ICL) underpins recent advances in large language models (LLMs), although its role and performance in causal reasoning remains unclear. Causal reasoning demands multihop composition and strict conjunctive control, and reliance on spurious lexical relations of the input could provide misleading results. We hypothesize that, due to their ability to project the input into a latent space, encoder and encoder decoder architectures are better suited for said multihop conjunctive reasoning versus decoder only models. To do this, we compare fine-tuned versions of all the aforementioned architectures with zero and few shot ICL in both natural language and non natural language scenarios. We find that ICL alone is insufficient for reliable causal reasoning, often overfocusing on irrelevant input features. In particular, decoder only models are noticeably brittle to distributional shifts, while finetuned encoder and encoder decoder models can generalize more robustly across our tests, including the non natural language split. Both architectures are only matched or surpassed by decoder only architectures at large scales. We conclude by noting that for cost effective, short horizon robust causal reasoning, encoder or encoder decoder architectures with targeted finetuning are preferable.

Abstract: Reward modeling has become a cornerstone of aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Yet, when extended to subjective and open-ended domains such as role play, existing reward models exhibit severe degradation, struggling to capture nuanced and persona-grounded human judgments. To address this gap, we introduce RoleRMBench, the first systematic benchmark for reward modeling in role-playing dialogue, covering seven fine-grained capabilities from narrative management to role consistency and engagement. Evaluation on RoleRMBench reveals large and consistent gaps between general-purpose reward models and human judgment, particularly in narrative and stylistic dimensions. We further propose RoleRM, a reward model trained with Continuous Implicit Preferences (CIP), which reformulates subjective evaluation as continuous consistent pairwise supervision under multiple structuring strategies. Comprehensive experiments show that RoleRM surpasses strong open- and closed-source reward models by over 24% on average, demonstrating substantial gains in narrative coherence and stylistic fidelity. Our findings highlight the importance of continuous preference representation and annotation consistency, establishing a foundation for subjective alignment in human-centered dialogue systems.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in multimodal large language models, agricultural applications remain constrained by the lack of multilingual speech data, unified multimodal architectures, and comprehensive evaluation benchmarks. To address these challenges, we present AgriGPT-Omni, an agricultural omni-framework that integrates speech, vision, and text in a unified framework. First, we construct a scalable data synthesis and collection pipeline that converts agricultural texts and images into training data, resulting in the largest agricultural speech dataset to date, including 492K synthetic and 1.4K real speech samples across six languages. Second, based on this, we train the first agricultural omni-model via a three-stage paradigm: textual knowledge injection, progressive multimodal alignment, and GRPO-based reinforcement learning, enabling unified reasoning across languages and modalities. Third, we propose AgriBench-Omni-2K, the first tri-modal benchmark for agriculture, covering diverse speech-vision-text tasks and multilingual slices, with standardized protocols and reproducible tools. Experiments show that AgriGPT-Omni significantly outperforms general-purpose baselines on multilingual and multimodal reasoning as well as real-world speech understanding. All models, data, benchmarks, and code will be released to promote reproducible research, inclusive agricultural intelligence, and sustainable AI development for low-resource regions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models are commonly trained on dominant languages like English, and their representation of low resource languages typically reflects cultural and linguistic biases present in the source language materials. Using the Serbian language as a case, this study examines the structural, historical, and sociotechnical factors shaping language technology development for low resource languages in the AI age. Drawing on semi structured interviews with ten scholars and practitioners, including linguists, digital humanists, and AI developers, it traces challenges rooted in historical destruction of Serbian textual heritage, intensified by contemporary issues that drive reductive, engineering first approaches prioritizing functionality over linguistic nuance. These include superficial transliteration, reliance on English-trained models, data bias, and dataset curation lacking cultural specificity. To address these challenges, the study proposes Data Care, a framework grounded in CARE principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics), that reframes bias mitigation from a post hoc technical fix to an integral component of corpus design, annotation, and governance, and positions Data Care as a replicable model for building inclusive, sustainable, and culturally grounded language technologies in contexts where traditional LLM development reproduces existing power imbalances and cultural blind spots.

Abstract: Textual data used to train large language models (LLMs) exhibits multifaceted bias manifestations encompassing harmful language and skewed demographic distributions. Regulations such as the European AI Act require identifying and mitigating biases against protected groups in data, with the ultimate goal of preventing unfair model outputs. However, practical guidance and operationalization are lacking. We propose a comprehensive data bias detection and mitigation pipeline comprising four components that address two data bias types, namely representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes for a configurable sensitive attribute. First, we leverage LLM-generated word lists created based on quality criteria to detect relevant group labels. Second, representation bias is quantified using the Demographic Representation Score. Third, we detect and mitigate stereotypes using sociolinguistically informed filtering. Finally, we compensate representation bias through Grammar- and Context-Aware Counterfactual Data Augmentation. We conduct a two-fold evaluation using the examples of gender, religion and age. First, the effectiveness of each individual component on data debiasing is evaluated through human validation and baseline comparison. The findings demonstrate that we successfully reduce representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes in a text dataset. Second, the effect of data debiasing on model bias reduction is evaluated by bias benchmarking of several models (0.6B-8B parameters), fine-tuned on the debiased text dataset. This evaluation reveals that LLMs fine-tuned on debiased data do not consistently show improved performance on bias benchmarks, exposing critical gaps in current evaluation methodologies and highlighting the need for targeted data manipulation to address manifested model bias.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress in solving complex reasoning tasks by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). This advancement is also inseparable from the oversight automated by reliable verifiers. However, current outcome-based verifiers (OVs) are unable to inspect the unreliable intermediate steps in the long reasoning chains of thought (CoTs). Meanwhile, current process-based verifiers (PVs) have difficulties in reliably detecting errors in the complex long CoTs, limited by the scarcity of high-quality annotations due to the prohibitive costs of human annotations. Therefore, we propose the \textbf{O}utcome-based \textbf{P}rocess \textbf{V}erifier (OPV), which verifies the rationale process of summarized outcomes from long CoTs to achieve both accurate and efficient verification and enable large-scale annotation. To empower the proposed verifier, we adopt an iterative active learning framework with expert annotations to progressively improve the verification capability of OPV with fewer annotation costs. Specifically, in each iteration, the most uncertain cases of the current best OPV are annotated and then subsequently used to train a new OPV through Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT) and RLVR for the next round. Extensive experiments demonstrate OPV's superior performance and broad applicability. It achieves new state-of-the-art results on our held-out \textsc{\thisbench}, outperforming much larger open-source models such as Qwen3-Max-Preview with an F1 score of 83.1 compared to 76.3. Furthermore, OPV effectively detects false positives within synthetic dataset, closely align with expert assessment. When collaborating with policy models, OPV consistently yields performance gains, e.g., raising the accuracy of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 55.2\% to 73.3\% on AIME2025 as the compute budget scales.

Abstract: Emergency speech recognition systems exhibit systematic performance degradation on non-standard English varieties, creating a critical gap in services for Caribbean populations. We present TRIDENT (Transcription and Routing Intelligence for Dispatcher-Empowered National Triage), a three-layer dispatcher-support architecture designed to structure emergency call inputs for human application of established triage protocols (the ESI for routine operations and START for mass casualty events), even when automatic speech recognition fails.
  The system combines Caribbean-accent-tuned ASR, local entity extraction via large language models, and bio-acoustic distress detection to provide dispatchers with three complementary signals: transcription confidence, structured clinical entities, and vocal stress indicators. Our key insight is that low ASR confidence, rather than representing system failure, serves as a valuable queue prioritization signal -- particularly when combined with elevated vocal distress markers indicating a caller in crisis whose speech may have shifted toward basilectal registers. A complementary insight drives the entity extraction layer: trained responders and composed bystanders may report life-threatening emergencies without elevated vocal stress, requiring semantic analysis to capture clinical indicators that paralinguistic features miss.
  We describe the architectural design, theoretical grounding in psycholinguistic research on stress-induced code-switching, and deployment considerations for offline operation during disaster scenarios. This work establishes a framework for accent-resilient emergency AI that ensures Caribbean voices receive equitable access to established national triage protocols. Empirical validation on Caribbean emergency calls remains future work.

Abstract: Achieving high-performing language models which include medium- and lower-resource languages remains a challenge. Massively multilingual models still underperform compared to language-specific adaptations, especially at smaller model scales. In this work, we investigate scaling as an efficient strategy for adapting pretrained models to new target languages. Through comprehensive scaling ablations with approximately FLOP-matched models, we test whether upscaling an English base model enables more effective and resource-efficient adaptation than standard continued pretraining. We find that, once exposed to sufficient target-language data, larger upscaled models can match or surpass the performance of smaller models continually pretrained on much more data, demonstrating the benefits of scaling for data efficiency. Scaling also helps preserve the base model's capabilities in English, thus reducing catastrophic forgetting. Finally, we explore whether such scaled, language-specific models can be merged to construct modular and flexible multilingual systems. We find that while merging remains less effective than joint multilingual training, upscaled merges perform better than smaller ones. We observe large performance differences across merging methods, suggesting potential for improvement through merging approaches specialized for language-level integration.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes clinical applications in India. In many such settings, speakers of Indian languages frequently communicate using romanized text rather than native scripts, yet existing research rarely evaluates this orthographic variation using real-world data. We investigate how romanization impacts the reliability of LLMs in a critical domain: maternal and newborn healthcare triage. We benchmark leading LLMs on a real-world dataset of user-generated queries spanning five Indian languages and Nepali. Our results reveal consistent degradation in performance for romanized messages, with F1 scores trailing those of native scripts by 5-12 points. At our partner maternal health organization in India, this gap could cause nearly 2 million excess errors in triage. Crucially, this performance gap by scripts is not due to a failure in clinical reasoning. We demonstrate that LLMs often correctly infer the semantic intent of romanized queries. Nevertheless, their final classification outputs remain brittle in the presence of orthographic noise in romanized inputs. Our findings highlight a critical safety blind spot in LLM-based health systems: models that appear to understand romanized input may still fail to act on it reliably.

Abstract: We introduce The FACTS Leaderboard, an online leaderboard suite and associated set of benchmarks that comprehensively evaluates the ability of language models to generate factually accurate text across diverse scenarios. The suite provides a holistic measure of factuality by aggregating the performance of models on four distinct sub-leaderboards: (1) FACTS Multimodal, which measures the factuality of responses to image-based questions; (2) FACTS Parametric, which assesses models' world knowledge by answering closed-book factoid questions from internal parameters; (3) FACTS Search, which evaluates factuality in information-seeking scenarios, where the model must use a search API; and (4) FACTS Grounding (v2), which evaluates whether long-form responses are grounded in provided documents, featuring significantly improved judge models. Each sub-leaderboard employs automated judge models to score model responses, and the final suite score is an average of the four components, designed to provide a robust and balanced assessment of a model's overall factuality. The FACTS Leaderboard Suite will be actively maintained, containing both public and private splits to allow for external participation while guarding its integrity.

Abstract: LabelFusion is a fusion ensemble for text classification that learns to combine a traditional transformer-based classifier (e.g., RoBERTa) with one or more Large Language Models (LLMs such as OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, or DeepSeek) to deliver accurate and cost-aware predictions across multi-class and multi-label tasks. The package provides a simple high-level interface (AutoFusionClassifier) that trains the full pipeline end-to-end with minimal configuration, and a flexible API for advanced users. Under the hood, LabelFusion integrates vector signals from both sources by concatenating the ML backbone's embeddings with the LLM-derived per-class scores -- obtained through structured prompt-engineering strategies -- and feeds this joint representation into a compact multi-layer perceptron (FusionMLP) that produces the final prediction. This learned fusion approach captures complementary strengths of LLM reasoning and traditional transformer-based classifiers, yielding robust performance across domains -- achieving 92.4% accuracy on AG News and 92.3% on 10-class Reuters 21578 topic classification -- while enabling practical trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and cost.

Abstract: This study analyzes the emotional tone of dialogue in J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit (1937) using computational text analysis. Dialogue was extracted with regular expressions, then preprocessed, and scored using the NRC-VAD lexicon to quantify emotional dimensions. The results show that the dialogue maintains a generally positive (high valence) and calm (low arousal) tone, with a gradually increasing sense of agency (dominance) as the story progresses. These patterns reflect the novel's emotional rhythm: moments of danger and excitement are regularly balanced by humor, camaraderie, and relief. Visualizations -- including emotional trajectory graphs and word clouds -- highlight how Tolkien's language cycles between tension and comfort. By combining computational tools with literary interpretation, this study demonstrates how digital methods can uncover subtle emotional structures in literature, revealing the steady rhythm and emotional modulation that shape the storytelling in The Hobbit.

Abstract: Emotions are central to politics and analyzing their role in political communication has a long tradition. As research increasingly leverages audio-visual materials to analyze the display of emotions, the emergence of multimodal generative AI promises great advances. However, we lack evidence about the effectiveness of multimodal AI in emotion analysis. This paper addresses this gap by evaluating current multimodal large language models (mLLMs) in video-based analysis of emotional arousal in two complementary data sets of human-labeled video recordings. I find that under ideal circumstances, mLLMs' emotional arousal ratings are highly reliable and show little to know indication of demographic bias. However, in recordings of speakers in real-world parliamentary debates, mLLMs' arousal ratings fail to deliver on this promise with potential negative consequences for downstream statistical inferences. This study therefore underscores the need for continued, thorough evaluation of emerging generative AI methods in political analysis and contributes a suitable replicable framework.

Abstract: Accurate real-time wind vector estimation is essential for enhancing the safety, navigation accuracy, and energy efficiency of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Traditional approaches rely on external sensors or simplify vehicle dynamics, which limits their applicability during agile flight or in resource-constrained platforms. This paper proposes a real-time wind estimation method based solely on onboard sensors. The approach first estimates external aerodynamic forces using a disturbance observer (DOB), and then maps these forces to wind vectors using a thin-plate spline (TPS) model. A custom-designed wind barrel mounted on the UAV enhances aerodynamic sensitivity, further improving estimation accuracy. The system is validated through comprehensive experiments in wind tunnels, indoor and outdoor flights. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistently high-accuracy wind estimation across controlled and real-world conditions, with speed RMSEs as low as \SI{0.06}{m/s} in wind tunnel tests, \SI{0.22}{m/s} during outdoor hover, and below \SI{0.38}{m/s} in indoor and outdoor dynamic flights, and direction RMSEs under \ang{7.3} across all scenarios, outperforming existing baselines. Moreover, the method provides vertical wind estimates -- unavailable in baselines -- with RMSEs below \SI{0.17}{m/s} even during fast indoor translations.

Abstract: Data valuation and monetisation are emerging as central challenges in data-driven economies, yet no unified framework exists to measure or manage data value across organisational contexts. This paper presents a systematic literature review of metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to data valuation and monetisation, focusing on the Internal Processes Perspective of the Balanced Scorecard (BSC). As part of a broader effort to explore all four BSC perspectives, we identify, categorise, and interrelate hundreds of metrics within a comprehensive taxonomy structured around three core clusters: Data Quality, Governance & Compliance, and Operational Efficiency. The taxonomy consolidates overlapping definitions, clarifies conceptual dependencies, and links technical, organisational, and regulatory indicators that underpin data value creation. By integrating these dimensions, it provides a foundation for the development of standardised and evidence-based valuation frameworks. Beyond its theoretical contribution, the taxonomy supports ongoing practical applications in decision-support systems and data valuation models, advancing the broader goal of establishing a coherent, dynamic approach to assessing and monetising data across industries.

Abstract: Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have demonstrated strong capability in modeling complex semantics across multi-type nodes and relations. However, their scalability to large-scale graphs remains challenging due to structural redundancy and high-dimensional node features. Existing graph condensation approaches, such as GCond, are primarily developed for homogeneous graphs and rely on gradient matching, resulting in considerable computational, memory, and optimization overhead. We propose HGC-Herd, a training-free condensation framework that generates compact yet informative heterogeneous graphs while maintaining both semantic and structural fidelity. HGC-Herd integrates lightweight feature propagation to encode multi-hop relational context and employs a class-wise herding mechanism to identify representative nodes per class, producing balanced and discriminative subsets for downstream learning tasks. Extensive experiments on ACM, DBLP, and Freebase validate that HGC-Herd attains comparable or superior accuracy to full-graph training while markedly reducing both runtime and memory consumption. These results underscore its practical value for efficient and scalable heterogeneous graph representation learning.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Constructing a Pareto set is pivotal for navigating the capability-efficiency trade-offs in Large Language Models (LLMs); however, existing merging techniques remain inadequate for this task. Coarse-grained, model-level methods yield only a sparse set of suboptimal solutions, while fine-grained, layer-wise approaches suffer from the "curse of dimensionality," rendering the search space computationally intractable. To resolve this dichotomy, we propose BAMBO (Bayesian Adaptive Multi-objective Block-wise Optimization), a novel framework that automatically constructs the LLM Pareto set. BAMBO renders the search tractable by introducing a Hybrid Optimal Block Partitioning strategy. Formulated as a 1D clustering problem, this strategy leverages a dynamic programming approach to optimally balance intra-block homogeneity and inter-block information distribution, thereby dramatically reducing dimensionality without sacrificing critical granularity. The entire process is automated within an evolutionary loop driven by the q-Expected Hypervolume Improvement (qEHVI) acquisition function. Experiments demonstrate that BAMBO discovers a superior and more comprehensive Pareto frontier than baselines, enabling agile model selection tailored to diverse operational constraints. Code is available at: https://github.com/xin8coder/BAMBO.

Abstract: Inspired by how humans combine direct interaction with action-free experience (e.g., videos), we study world models that learn from heterogeneous data. Standard world models typically rely on action-conditioned trajectories, which limits effectiveness when action labels are scarce. We introduce a family of latent-action world models that jointly use action-conditioned and action-free data by learning a shared latent action representation. This latent space aligns observed control signals with actions inferred from passive observations, enabling a single dynamics model to train on large-scale unlabeled trajectories while requiring only a small set of action-labeled ones. We use the latent-action world model to learn a latent-action policy through offline reinforcement learning (RL), thereby bridging two traditionally separate domains: offline RL, which typically relies on action-conditioned data, and action-free training, which is rarely used with subsequent RL. On the DeepMind Control Suite, our approach achieves strong performance while using about an order of magnitude fewer action-labeled samples than purely action-conditioned baselines. These results show that latent actions enable training on both passive and interactive data, which makes world models learn more efficiently.

Abstract: Finding cause-effect relationships is of key importance in science. Causal discovery aims to recover a graph from data that succinctly describes these cause-effect relationships. However, current methods face several challenges, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data and complex dependencies. Incorporating prior knowledge about the system can aid causal discovery. In this work, we leverage Cluster-DAGs as a prior knowledge framework to warm-start causal discovery. We show that Cluster-DAGs offer greater flexibility than existing approaches based on tiered background knowledge and introduce two modified constraint-based algorithms, Cluster-PC and Cluster-FCI, for causal discovery in the fully and partially observed setting, respectively. Empirical evaluation on simulated data demonstrates that Cluster-PC and Cluster-FCI outperform their respective baselines without prior knowledge.

Abstract: Accelerated gradient methods like Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG) achieve faster convergence on well-conditioned problems but often diverge on ill-conditioned or non-convex landscapes due to aggressive momentum accumulation. We propose Heavy-Ball Synthetic Gradient Extrapolation (HB-SGE), a robust first-order method that combines heavy-ball momentum with predictive gradient extrapolation. Unlike classical momentum methods that accumulate historical gradients, HB-SGE estimates future gradient directions using local Taylor approximations, providing adaptive acceleration while maintaining stability. We prove convergence guarantees for strongly convex functions and demonstrate empirically that HB-SGE prevents divergence on problems where NAG and standard momentum fail. On ill-conditioned quadratics (condition number $κ=50$), HB-SGE converges in 119 iterations while both SGD and NAG diverge. On the non-convex Rosenbrock function, HB-SGE achieves convergence in 2,718 iterations where classical momentum methods diverge within 10 steps. While NAG remains faster on well-conditioned problems, HB-SGE provides a robust alternative with speedup over SGD across diverse landscapes, requiring only $O(d)$ memory overhead and the same hyperparameters as standard momentum.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is integral for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Multiple-Reference Preference Optimization (MRPO) builds on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by fine-tuning LLMs on preference datasets while regularizing the policy towards a mixture of reference models to leverage their collective desirable properties. However, current methods for setting the reference weights are ad-hoc and statistically unsound, leading to unreliable performance. To address this, we introduce four new weighting strategies: two offline methods that leverage held-out validation signal; one online method that uses a sliding-window estimator to reduce overfitting; and an online method that treats reference weighting as a $K$-armed bandit via Thompson Sampling. Experiments using Qwen2.5-0.5B as the policy model and seven reference models from the Llama, Mistral, Qwen, Yi, and Phi families (0.5B-14B each) show that all 4 of our strategies outperform the current MRPO weighting methods on UltraFeedback and SafeRLHF in preference accuracy. More thought-provokingly, however, we find that single-reference DPO, using any of 6 out of 7 references, consistently outperforms all tested multiple-reference approaches -- calling into question the practical appeal of multiple-reference approaches.

Abstract: In the unsupervised pre-training for reinforcement learning, the agent aims to learn a prior policy for downstream tasks without relying on task-specific reward functions. We focus on state entropy maximization (SEM), where the goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the entropy of the state stationary distribution. In this paper, we introduce SEMDICE, a principled off-policy algorithm that computes an SEM policy from an arbitrary off-policy dataset, which optimizes the policy directly within the space of stationary distributions. SEMDICE computes a single, stationary Markov state-entropy-maximizing policy from an arbitrary off-policy dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that SEMDICE outperforms baseline algorithms in maximizing state entropy while achieving the best adaptation efficiency for downstream tasks among SEM-based unsupervised RL pre-training methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks through in-context learning but often under-perform in Named Entity Recognition (NER), especially for lower-resource languages like Portuguese. While open-weight LLMs enable local deployment, no single model dominates all tasks, motivating ensemble approaches. However, existing LLM ensembles focus on text generation or classification, leaving NER under-explored. In this context, this work proposes a novel three-step ensemble pipeline for zero-shot NER using similarly capable, locally run LLMs. Our method outperforms individual LLMs in four out of five Portuguese NER datasets by leveraging a heuristic to select optimal model combinations with minimal annotated data. Moreover, we show that ensembles obtained on different source datasets generally outperform individual LLMs in cross-dataset configurations, potentially eliminating the need for annotated data for the current task. Our work advances scalable, low-resource, and zero-shot NER by effectively combining multiple small LLMs without fine-tuning. Code is available at https://github.com/Joao-Luz/local-llm-ner-ensemble.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-driven agents are emerging as a powerful new paradigm for solving complex problems. Despite the empirical success of these practices, a theoretical framework to understand and unify their macroscopic dynamics remains lacking. This Letter proposes a method based on the least action principle to estimate the underlying generative directionality of LLMs embedded within agents. By experimentally measuring the transition probabilities between LLM-generated states, we statistically discover a detailed balance in LLM-generated transitions, indicating that LLM generation may not be achieved by generally learning rule sets and strategies, but rather by implicitly learning a class of underlying potential functions that may transcend different LLM architectures and prompt templates. To our knowledge, this is the first discovery of a macroscopic physical law in LLM generative dynamics that does not depend on specific model details. This work is an attempt to establish a macroscopic dynamics theory of complex AI systems, aiming to elevate the study of AI agents from a collection of engineering practices to a science built on effective measurements that are predictable and quantifiable.

Abstract: This paper presents a mixed-methodology to forecast illegal border crossings in Europe across five key migratory routes, with a one-year time horizon. The methodology integrates machine learning techniques with qualitative insights from migration experts. This approach aims at improving the predictive capacity of data-driven models through the inclusion of a human-assessed covariate, an innovation that addresses challenges posed by sudden shifts in migration patterns and limitations in traditional datasets. The proposed methodology responds directly to the forecasting needs outlined in the EU Pact on Migration and Asylum, supporting the Asylum and Migration Management Regulation (AMMR). It is designed to provide policy-relevant forecasts that inform strategic decisions, early warning systems, and solidarity mechanisms among EU Member States. By joining data-driven modeling with expert judgment, this work aligns with existing academic recommendations and introduces a novel operational tool tailored for EU migration governance. The methodology is tested and validated with known data to demonstrate its applicability and reliability in migration-related policy context.

Abstract: Evaluating defensive performance in soccer remains challenging, as effective defending is often expressed not through visible on-ball actions such as interceptions and tackles, but through preventing dangerous opportunities before they arise. Existing approaches have largely focused on valuing on-ball actions, leaving much of defenders' true impact unmeasured. To address this gap, we propose DEFCON (DEFensive CONtribution evaluator), a comprehensive framework that quantifies player-level defensive contributions for every attacking situation in soccer. Leveraging Graph Attention Networks, DEFCON estimates the success probability and expected value of each attacking option, along with each defender's responsibility for stopping it. These components yield an Expected Possession Value (EPV) for the attacking team before and after each action, and DEFCON assigns positive or negative credits to defenders according to whether they reduced or increased the opponent's EPV. Trained on 2023-24 and evaluated on 2024-25 Eredivisie event and tracking data, DEFCON's aggregated player credits exhibit strong positive correlations with market valuations. Finally, we showcase several practical applications, including in-game timelines of defensive contributions, spatial analyses across pitch zones, and pairwise summaries of attacker-defender interactions.

Abstract: Time series forecasting requires models that can efficiently capture complex temporal dependencies, especially in large-scale and high-dimensional settings. While Transformer-based architectures excel at modeling long-range dependencies, their quadratic computational complexity poses limitations on scalability and adaptability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce DB2-TransF, a novel Transformer-inspired architecture that replaces the self-attention mechanism with a learnable Daubechies wavelet coefficient layer. This wavelet-based module efficiently captures multi-scale local and global patterns and enhances the modeling of correlations across multiple time series for the time series forecasting task. Extensive experiments on 13 standard forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that DB2-TransF achieves comparable or superior predictive accuracy to conventional Transformers, while substantially reducing memory usage for the time series forecasting task. The obtained experimental results position DB2-TransF as a scalable and resource-efficient framework for advanced time series forecasting.

Abstract: Autoregressive forecasting is central to predictive control in diabetes and hemodynamic management, where different operating zones carry different clinical risks. Standard models trained with teacher forcing suffer from exposure bias, yielding unstable multi-step forecasts for closed-loop use. We introduce Soft-Token Trajectory Forecasting (SoTra), which propagates continuous probability distributions (``soft tokens'') to mitigate exposure bias and learn calibrated, uncertainty-aware trajectories. A risk-aware decoding module then minimizes expected clinical harm. In glucose forecasting, SoTra reduces average zone-based risk by 18\%; in blood-pressure forecasting, it lowers effective clinical risk by approximately 15\%. These improvements support its use in safety-critical predictive control.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become effective zero-shot classifiers, but their high computational requirements and environmental costs limit their practicality for large-scale annotation in high-performance computing (HPC) environments. To support more sustainable workflows, we present \textsc{Text2Graph}, an open-source Python package that provides a modular implementation of existing text-to-graph classification approaches. The framework enables users to combine LLM-based partial annotation with Graph Neural Network (GNN) label propagation in a flexible manner, making it straightforward to swap components such as feature extractors, edge construction methods, and sampling strategies. We benchmark \textsc{Text2Graph} on a zero-shot setting using five datasets spanning topic classification and sentiment analysis tasks, comparing multiple variants against other zero-shot approaches for text classification. In addition to reporting performance, we provide detailed estimates of energy consumption and carbon emissions, showing that graph-based propagation achieves competitive results at a fraction of the energy and environmental cost.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable image-based diagnosis remains a fundamental challenge in medical AI, particularly under domain shifts and rare-class conditions. Deep learning models often struggle with real-world distribution changes, exhibit bias against infrequent pathologies, and lack the transparency required for deployment in safety-critical clinical environments. We introduce MedXAI (An Explainable Framework for Medical Imaging Classification), a unified expert knowledge based framework that integrates deep vision models with clinician-derived expert knowledge to improve generalization, reduce rare-class bias, and provide human-understandable explanations by localizing the relevant diagnostic features rather than relying on technical post-hoc methods (e.g., Saliency Maps, LIME). We evaluate MedXAI across heterogeneous modalities on two challenging tasks: (i) Seizure Onset Zone localization from resting-state fMRI, and (ii) Diabetic Retinopathy grading. Ex periments on ten multicenter datasets show consistent gains, including a 3% improvement in cross-domain generalization and a 10% improvmnet in F1 score of rare class, substantially outperforming strong deep learning baselines. Ablations confirm that the symbolic components act as effective clinical priors and regularizers, improving robustness under distribution shift. MedXAI delivers clinically aligned explanations while achieving superior in-domain and cross-domain performance, particularly for rare diseases in multimodal medical AI.

Abstract: Learning the flows of hybrid systems that have both continuous and discrete time dynamics is challenging. The existing method learns the dynamics in each discrete mode, which suffers from the combination of mode switching and discontinuities in the flows. In this work, we propose CHyLL (Continuous Hybrid System Learning in Latent Space), which learns a continuous neural representation of a hybrid system without trajectory segmentation, event functions, or mode switching. The key insight of CHyLL is that the reset map glues the state space at the guard surface, reformulating the state space as a piecewise smooth quotient manifold where the flow becomes spatially continuous. Building upon these insights and the embedding theorems grounded in differential topology, CHyLL concurrently learns a singularity-free neural embedding in a higher-dimensional space and the continuous flow in it. We showcase that CHyLL can accurately predict the flow of hybrid systems with superior accuracy and identify the topological invariants of the hybrid systems. Finally, we apply CHyLL to the stochastic optimal control problem.

Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms some classical estimators in undersampled regimes, and performs comparably with some well-established state-of-the-art estimators.

Abstract: Traditional feature engineering approaches for molecular sequence classification suffer from sparsity issues and computational complexity, while deep learning models often underperform on tabular biological data. This paper introduces a novel topological approach that transforms molecular sequences into images by combining Chaos Game Representation (CGR) with Rips complex construction from algebraic topology. Our method maps sequence elements to 2D coordinates via CGR, computes pairwise distances, and constructs Rips complexes to capture both local structural and global topological features. We provide formal guarantees on representation uniqueness, topological stability, and information preservation. Extensive experiments on anticancer peptide datasets demonstrate superior performance over vector-based, sequence language models, and existing image-based methods, achieving 86.8\% and 94.5\% accuracy on breast and lung cancer datasets, respectively. The topological representation preserves critical sequence information while enabling effective utilization of vision-based deep learning architectures for molecular sequence analysis.

Abstract: Early detection and characterization of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, remain critical for effective clinical response and public-health planning. The global availability of large-scale viral sequence data presents significant opportunities for computational analysis; however, existing approaches face notable limitations. Phylogenetic tree-based methods are computationally intensive and do not scale efficiently to today's multi-million-sequence datasets. Similarly, current embedding-based techniques often rely on aligned sequences or exhibit suboptimal predictive performance and high runtime costs, creating barriers to practical large-scale analysis. In this study, we focus on the most prevalent SARS-CoV-2 lineages associated with the spike protein region and introduce a scalable embedding method that leverages hashing to generate compact, low-dimensional representations of spike sequences. These embeddings are subsequently used to train a variety of machine learning models for supervised lineage classification. We conduct an extensive evaluation comparing our approach with multiple baseline and state-of-the-art biological sequence embedding methods across diverse metrics. Our results demonstrate that the proposed embeddings offer substantial improvements in efficiency, achieving up to 86.4\% classification accuracy while reducing embedding generation time by as much as 99.81\%. This highlights the method's potential as a fast, effective, and scalable solution for large-scale viral sequence analysis.

Abstract: Causal discovery methods have traditionally been developed under two distinct regimes: independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and timeseries data, each governed by separate modelling assumptions. In this paper, we argue that the i.i.d. setting can and should be reframed in terms of exchangeability, a strictly more general symmetry principle. We present the implications of this reframing, alongside two core arguments: (1) a conceptual argument, based on extending the dependency of experimental causal inference on exchangeability to causal discovery; and (2) an empirical argument, showing that many existing i.i.d. causal-discovery methods are predicated on exchangeability assumptions, and that the sole extensive widely-used real-world "i.i.d." benchmark (the Tübingen dataset) consists mainly of exchangeable (and not i.i.d.) examples. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel synthetic dataset that enforces only the exchangeability assumption, without imposing the stronger i.i.d. assumption. We show that our exchangeable synthetic dataset mirrors the statistical structure of the real-world "i.i.d." dataset more closely than all other i.i.d. synthetic datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the predictive capability of this dataset by proposing a neural-network-based causal-discovery algorithm trained exclusively on our synthetic dataset, and which performs similarly to other state-of-the-art i.i.d. methods on the real-world benchmark.

Abstract: High-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) provides a noninvasive neural interface for assistive and rehabilitation control, but mapping neural activity to user motor intent remains challenging. We assess a spiking neural network (SNN) as a neuromorphic architecture against a temporal convolutional network (TCN) for decoding fingertip force from motor-unit (MU) firing derived from HD-sEMG. Data were collected from a single participant (10 trials) with two forearm electrode arrays; MU activity was obtained via FastICA-based decomposition, and models were trained on overlapping windows with end-to-end causal convolutions. On held-out trials, the TCN achieved 4.44% MVC RMSE (Pearson r = 0.974) while the SNN achieved 8.25% MVC (r = 0.922). While the TCN was more accurate, we view the SNN as a realistic neuromorphic baseline that could close much of this gap with modest architectural and hyperparameter refinements.

Abstract: In practical deep learning deployment, the scarcity of data and the imbalance of label distributions often lead to semantically uncovered regions within the real-world data distribution, hindering model training and causing misclassification near class boundaries as well as unstable behaviors in peripheral areas. Although recent large language models (LLMs) show promise for data augmentation, an integrated framework that simultaneously achieves directional control of generation, domain alignment, and quality control has not yet been fully established. To address these challenges, we propose a Cluster-conditioned Interpolative and Extrapolative framework for Geometry-Aware and Domain-aligned data augmentation (CIEGAD), which systematically complements both in-distribution and out-of-distribution semantically uncovered regions. CIEGAD constructs domain profiles through cluster conditioning, allocates generation with a hierarchical frequency-geometric allocation integrating class frequency and geometric indicators, and finely controls generation directions via the coexistence of interpolative and extrapolative synthesis. It further performs quality control through geometry-constrained filtering combined with an LLM-as-a-Judge mechanism. Experiments on multiple classification tasks demonstrate that CIEGAD effectively extends the periphery of real-world data distributions while maintaining high alignment between generated and real-world data as well as semantic diversity. In particular, for long-tailed and multi-class classification tasks, CIEGAD consistently improves F1 and recall, validating the triple harmony of distributional consistency, diversity, and quality. These results indicate that CIEGAD serves as a practically oriented data augmentation framework that complements underrepresented regions while preserving alignment with real-world data.

Abstract: Non-random missing data is a ubiquitous yet undertreated flaw in multidimensional time series, fundamentally threatening the reliability of data-driven analysis and decision-making. Pure low-rank tensor completion, as a classical data recovery method, falls short in handling non-random missingness, both methodologically and theoretically. Hankel-structured tensor completion models provide a feasible approach for recovering multidimensional time series with non-random missing patterns. However, most Hankel-based multidimensional data recovery methods both suffer from unclear sources of Hankel tensor low-rankness and lack an exact recovery theory for non-random missing data. To address these issues, we propose the temporal isometric delay-embedding transform, which constructs a Hankel tensor whose low-rankness is naturally induced by the smoothness and periodicity of the underlying time series. Leveraging this property, we develop the \textit{Low-Rank Tensor Completion with Temporal Isometric Delay-embedding Transform} (LRTC-TIDT) model, which characterizes the low-rank structure under the \textit{Tensor Singular Value Decomposition} (t-SVD) framework. Once the prescribed non-random sampling conditions and mild incoherence assumptions are satisfied, the proposed LRTC-TIDT model achieves exact recovery, as confirmed by simulation experiments under various non-random missing patterns. Furthermore, LRTC-TIDT consistently outperforms existing tensor-based methods across multiple real-world tasks, including network flow reconstruction, urban traffic estimation, and temperature field prediction. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/HaoShu2000/LRTC-TIDT.

Abstract: Federated domain generalization (FedDG) addresses distribution shifts among clients in a federated learning framework. FedDG methods aggregate the parameters of locally trained client models to form a global model that generalizes to unseen clients while preserving data privacy. While improving the generalization capability of the global model, many existing approaches in FedDG jeopardize privacy by sharing statistics of client data between themselves. Our solution addresses this problem by contributing new ways to perform local client training and model aggregation. To improve local client training, we enforce (domain) invariance across local models with the help of a novel technique, \textbf{latent space inversion}, which enables better client privacy. When clients are not \emph{i.i.d}, aggregating their local models may discard certain local adaptations. To overcome this, we propose an \textbf{important weight} aggregation strategy to prioritize parameters that significantly influence predictions of local models during aggregation. Our extensive experiments show that our approach achieves superior results over state-of-the-art methods with less communication overhead.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical task for artificial intelligence with numerous real-world applications. Traditional approaches primarily rely on historical time series data to predict the future values. However, in practical scenarios, this is often insufficient for accurate predictions due to the limited information available. To address this challenge, multimodal time series forecasting methods which incorporate additional data modalities, mainly text data, alongside time series data have been explored. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Information Routing (AIR) framework, a novel approach for multimodal time series forecasting. Unlike existing methods that treat text data on par with time series data as interchangeable auxiliary features for forecasting, AIR leverages text information to dynamically guide the time series model by controlling how and to what extent multivariate time series information should be combined. We also present a text-refinement pipeline that employs a large language model to convert raw text data into a form suitable for multimodal forecasting, and we introduce a benchmark that facilitates multimodal forecasting experiments based on this pipeline. Experiment results with the real world market data such as crude oil price and exchange rates demonstrate that AIR effectively modulates the behavior of the time series model using textual inputs, significantly enhancing forecasting accuracy in various time series forecasting tasks.

Abstract: Multi-output Gaussian process (MGP) models have attracted significant attention for their flexibility and uncertainty-quantification capabilities, and have been widely adopted in multi-source transfer learning scenarios due to their ability to capture inter-task correlations. However, they still face several challenges in transfer learning. First, the input spaces of the source and target domains are often heterogeneous, which makes direct knowledge transfer difficult. Second, potential prior knowledge and physical information are typically ignored during heterogeneous transfer, hampering the utilization of domain-specific insights and leading to unstable mappings. Third, inappropriate information sharing among target and sources can easily lead to negative transfer. Traditional models fail to address these issues in a unified way. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a Double-Regularized Heterogeneous Gaussian Process framework (R^2-HGP). Specifically, a trainable prior probability mapping model is first proposed to align the heterogeneous input domains. The resulting aligned inputs are treated as latent variables, upon which a multi-source transfer GP model is constructed and the entire structure is integrated into a novel conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) based framework. Physical insights is further incorporated as a regularization term to ensure that the alignment results adhere to known physical knowledge. Next, within the multi-source transfer GP model, a sparsity penalty is imposed on the transfer coefficients, enabling the model to adaptively select the most informative source outputs and suppress negative transfer. Extensive simulations and real-world engineering case studies validate the effectiveness of our R^2-HGP, demonstrating consistent superiority over state-of-the-art benchmarks across diverse evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Surrogate models provide fast alternatives to costly aerodynamic simulations and are extremely useful in design and optimization applications. This study proposes the use of a recent kernel-based neural surrogate, KHRONOS. In this work, we blend sparse high-fidelity (HF) data with low-fidelity (LF) information to predict aerodynamic fields under varying constraints in computational resources. Unlike traditional approaches, KHRONOS is built upon variational principles, interpolation theory, and tensor decomposition. These elements provide a mathematical basis for heavy pruning compared to dense neural networks. Using the AirfRANS dataset as a high-fidelity benchmark and NeuralFoil to generate low-fidelity counterparts, this work compares the performance of KHRONOS with three contemporary model architectures: a multilayer perceptron (MLP), a graph neural network (GNN), and a physics-informed neural network (PINN). We consider varying levels of high-fidelity data availability (0%, 10%, and 30%) and increasingly complex geometry parameterizations. These are used to predict the surface pressure coefficient distribution over the airfoil. Results indicate that, whilst all models eventually achieve comparable predictive accuracy, KHRONOS excels in resource-constrained conditions. In this domain, KHRONOS consistently requires orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters and delivers much faster training and inference than contemporary dense neural networks at comparable accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of KHRONOS and similar architectures to balance accuracy and efficiency in multi-fidelity aerodynamic field prediction.

Abstract: Background. Treatment selection for low to intermediate risk patients with severe aortic stenosis between surgical (SAVR) and transcatheter (TAVR) aortic valve replacement remains variable in clinical practice, driven by patient heterogeneity and institutional preferences. While existing models predict postprocedural risk, there is a lack of interpretable, individualized treatment recommendations that directly optimize long-term outcomes.
  Methods. We introduce an interpretable prescriptive framework that integrates prognostic matching, counterfactual outcome modeling, and an Optimal Policy Tree (OPT) to recommend the treatment minimizing expected 5-year mortality. Using data from Hartford Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital, we emulate randomization via prognostic matching and sample weighting and estimate counterfactual mortality under both SAVR and TAVR. The policy model, trained on these counterfactual predictions, partitions patients into clinically coherent subgroups and prescribes the treatment associated with lower estimated risk.
  Findings. If the OPT prescriptions are applied, counterfactual evaluation showed an estimated reduction in 5-year mortality of 20.3\% in Hartford and 13.8\% in St. Vincent's relative to real-life prescriptions, showing promising generalizability to unseen data from a different institution. The learned decision boundaries aligned with real-world outcomes and clinical observations.
  Interpretation. Our interpretable prescriptive framework is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to provide transparent, data-driven recommendations for TAVR versus SAVR that improve estimated long-term outcomes both in an internal and external cohort, while remaining clinically grounded and contributing toward a more systematic and evidence-based approach to precision medicine in structural heart disease.

Abstract: Magnetization of a ferromagnetic substance in response to an externally applied magnetic field increases with the strength of the field. This is because at the microscopic level, magnetic moments in certain regions or domains of the substance increasingly align with the applied field, while the amount of misaligned domains decreases. The alignment of such magnetic domains with an applied magnetic field forms the physical basis for the nonlinearity of magnetization. In this paper, the nonlinear function is approximated as a combination of continued fraction of straight lines. The resulting fit is used to interpret the nonlinear behavior in both growing and shrinking magnetic domains. The continued fraction of straight lines used here is an algebraic expression which can be used to estimate parameters using nonlinear regression.

Abstract: Distributed machine learning systems require strong privacy guarantees, verifiable compliance, and scalable deployment across heterogeneous and multi-cloud environments. This work introduces a cloud-native privacy-preserving architecture that integrates federated learning, differential privacy, zero-knowledge compliance proofs, and adaptive governance powered by reinforcement learning. The framework supports secure model training and inference without centralizing sensitive data, while enabling cryptographically verifiable policy enforcement across institutions and cloud platforms. A full prototype deployed across hybrid Kubernetes clusters demonstrates reduced membership-inference risk, consistent enforcement of formal privacy budgets, and stable model performance under differential privacy. Experimental evaluation across multi-institution workloads shows that the architecture maintains utility with minimal overhead while providing continuous, risk-aware governance. The proposed framework establishes a practical foundation for deploying trustworthy and compliant distributed machine learning systems at scale.

Abstract: Agentic systems built on large language models operate through recursive feedback loops, where each output becomes the next input. Yet the geometric behavior of these agentic loops (whether they converge, diverge, or exhibit more complex dynamics) remains poorly understood. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analyzing agentic trajectories in semantic embedding space, treating iterative transformations as discrete dynamical systems. We distinguish the artifact space, where linguistic transformations occur, from the embedding space, where geometric measurements are performed. Because cosine similarity is biased by embedding anisotropy, we introduce an isotonic calibration that eliminates systematic bias and aligns similarities with human semantic judgments while preserving high local stability. This enables rigorous measurement of trajectories, clusters and attractors. Through controlled experiments on singular agentic loops, we identify two fundamental regimes. A contractive rewriting loop converges toward a stable attractor with decreasing dispersion, while an exploratory summarize and negate loop produces unbounded divergence with no cluster formation. These regimes display qualitatively distinct geometric signatures of contraction and expansion. Our results show that prompt design directly governs the dynamical regime of an agentic loop, enabling systematic control of convergence, divergence and trajectory structure in iterative LLM transformations.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in underwater environments remains a major challenge due to the absence of GPS, degraded visibility, and the presence of submerged obstacles. This article investigates these issues through the case of the BlueROV2, an open platform widely used for scientific experimentation. We propose a deep reinforcement learning approach based on the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, using an observation space that combines target-oriented navigation information, a virtual occupancy grid, and ray-casting along the boundaries of the operational area. The learned policy is compared against a reference deterministic kinematic planner, the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), commonly employed as a robust baseline for obstacle avoidance. The evaluation is conducted in a realistic simulation environment and complemented by validation on a physical BlueROV2 supervised by a 3D digital twin of the test site, helping to reduce risks associated with real-world experimentation. The results show that the PPO policy consistently outperforms DWA in highly cluttered environments, notably thanks to better local adaptation and reduced collisions. Finally, the experiments demonstrate the transferability of the learned behavior from simulation to the real world, confirming the relevance of deep RL for autonomous navigation in underwater robotics.

Abstract: Temporal-difference (TD) methods learn state and action values efficiently by bootstrapping from their own future value predictions, but such a self-bootstrapping mechanism is prone to bootstrapping bias, where the errors in the value targets accumulate across steps and result in biased value estimates. Recent work has proposed to use chunked critics, which estimate the value of short action sequences ("chunks") rather than individual actions, speeding up value backup. However, extracting policies from chunked critics is challenging: policies must output the entire action chunk open-loop, which can be sub-optimal for environments that require policy reactivity and also challenging to model especially when the chunk length grows. Our key insight is to decouple the chunk length of the critic from that of the policy, allowing the policy to operate over shorter action chunks. We propose a novel algorithm that achieves this by optimizing the policy against a distilled critic for partial action chunks, constructed by optimistically backing up from the original chunked critic to approximate the maximum value achievable when a partial action chunk is extended to a complete one. This design retains the benefits of multi-step value propagation while sidestepping both the open-loop sub-optimality and the difficulty of learning action chunking policies for long action chunks. We evaluate our method on challenging, long-horizon offline goal-conditioned tasks and show that it reliably outperforms prior methods. Code: github.com/ColinQiyangLi/dqc.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) underpin critical applications yet remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, typically reliant on heuristic brute-force methods. Despite significant empirical advancements in backdoor research, the lack of rigorous theoretical analysis limits understanding of underlying mechanisms, constraining attack predictability and adaptability. Therefore, we provide a theoretical analysis targeting backdoor attacks, focusing on how sparse decision boundaries enable disproportionate model manipulation. Based on this finding, we derive a closed-form, ambiguous boundary region, wherein negligible relabeled samples induce substantial misclassification. Influence function analysis further quantifies significant parameter shifts caused by these margin samples, with minimal impact on clean accuracy, formally grounding why such low poison rates suffice for efficacious attacks. Leveraging these insights, we propose Eminence, an explainable and robust black-box backdoor framework with provable theoretical guarantees and inherent stealth properties. Eminence optimizes a universal, visually subtle trigger that strategically exploits vulnerable decision boundaries and effectively achieves robust misclassification with exceptionally low poison rates (< 0.1%, compared to SOTA methods typically requiring > 1%). Comprehensive experiments validate our theoretical discussions and demonstrate the effectiveness of Eminence, confirming an exponential relationship between margin poisoning and adversarial boundary manipulation. Eminence maintains > 90% attack success rate, exhibits negligible clean-accuracy loss, and demonstrates high transferability across diverse models, datasets and scenarios.

Abstract: Modern deep networks operate in a rough, finite-regularity regime where Jacobian-induced operators exhibit heavy-tailed spectra and strong basis drift. In this work, we derive a unified operator-theoretoretic description of neural training dynamics directly from gradient descent. Starting from the exact evolution $\dot e_t = -M(t)e_t$ in function space, we apply Kato perturbation theory to obtain a rigorous system of coupled mode ODEs and show that, after coarse-graining, these dynamics converge to a spectral transport-dissipation PDE \[ \partial_t g + \partial_λ(v g) = -λg + S, \] where $v$ captures eigenbasis drift and $S$ encodes nonlocal spectral coupling.
  We prove that neural training preserves functional regularity, forcing the drift to take an asymptotic power-law form $v(λ,t)\sim -c(t)λ^b$. In the weak-coupling regime -- naturally induced by spectral locality and SGD noise -- the PDE admits self-similar solutions with a resolution frontier, polynomial amplitude growth, and power-law dissipation. This structure yields explicit scaling-law exponents, explains the geometry of double descent, and shows that the effective training time satisfies $τ(t)=t^αL(t)$ for slowly varying $L$.
  Finally, we show that NTK training and feature learning arise as two limits of the same PDE: $v\equiv 0$ recovers lazy dynamics, while $v\neq 0$ produces representation drift. Our results provide a unified spectral framework connecting operator geometry, optimization dynamics, and the universal scaling behavior of modern deep networks.

Abstract: A key aspect of human cognition is metacognition - the ability to assess one's own knowledge and judgment reliability. While deep learning models can express confidence in their predictions, they often suffer from poor calibration, a cognitive bias where expressed confidence does not reflect true competence. Do models truly know what they know? Drawing from human cognitive science, we propose a new framework for evaluating and leveraging AI metacognition. We introduce meta-d', a psychologically-grounded measure of metacognitive sensitivity, to characterise how reliably a model's confidence predicts its own accuracy. We then use this dynamic sensitivity score as context for a bandit-based arbiter that performs test-time model selection, learning which of several expert models to trust for a given task. Our experiments across multiple datasets and deep learning model combinations (including CNNs and VLMs) demonstrate that this metacognitive approach improves joint-inference accuracy over constituent models. This work provides a novel behavioural account of AI models, recasting ensemble selection as a problem of evaluating both short-term signals (confidence prediction scores) and medium-term traits (metacognitive sensitivity).

Abstract: Forward Osmosis (FO) is a promising low-energy membrane separation technology, but challenges in accurately modelling its water flux (Jw) persist due to complex internal mass transfer phenomena. Traditional mechanistic models struggle with empirical parameter variability, while purely data-driven models lack physical consistency and rigorous uncertainty quantification (UQ). This study introduces a novel Robust Hybrid Physics-ML framework employing Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for highly accurate, uncertainty-aware Jw prediction. The core innovation lies in training the GPR on the residual error between the detailed, non-linear FO physical model prediction (Jw_physical) and the experimental water flux (Jw_actual). Crucially, we implement a full UQ methodology by decomposing the total predictive variance (sigma2_total) into model uncertainty (epistemic, from GPR's posterior variance) and input uncertainty (aleatoric, analytically propagated via the Delta method for multi-variate correlated inputs). Leveraging the inherent strength of GPR in low-data regimes, the model, trained on a meagre 120 data points, achieved a state-of-the-art Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.26% and an R2 of 0.999 on the independent test data, validating a truly robust and reliable surrogate model for advanced FO process optimization and digital twin development.

Abstract: Neural network constraint satisfaction is crucial for safety-critical applications such as power system optimization, robotic path planning, and autonomous driving. However, existing constraint satisfaction methods face efficiency-applicability trade-offs, with hard constraint methods suffering from either high computational complexity or restrictive assumptions on constraint structures. The Sampling Kaczmarz-Motzkin (SKM) method is a randomized iterative algorithm for solving large-scale linear inequality systems with favorable convergence properties, but its argmax operations introduce non-differentiability, posing challenges for neural network applications. This work proposes the Trainable Sampling Kaczmarz-Motzkin Network (T-SKM-Net) framework and, for the first time, systematically integrates SKM-type methods into neural network constraint satisfaction. The framework transforms mixed constraint problems into pure inequality problems through null space transformation, employs SKM for iterative solving, and maps solutions back to the original constraint space, efficiently handling both equality and inequality constraints. We provide theoretical proof of post-processing effectiveness in expectation and end-to-end trainability guarantees based on unbiased gradient estimators, demonstrating that despite non-differentiable operations, the framework supports standard backpropagation. On the DCOPF case118 benchmark, our method achieves 4.27ms/item GPU serial forward inference with 0.0025% max optimality gap with post-processing mode and 5.25ms/item with 0.0008% max optimality gap with joint training mode, delivering over 25$\times$ speedup compared to the pandapower solver while maintaining zero constraint violations under given tolerance.

Abstract: Robust adversarial reinforcement learning has emerged as an effective paradigm for training agents to handle uncertain disturbance in real environments, with critical applications in sequential decision-making domains such as autonomous driving and robotic control. Within this paradigm, agent training is typically formulated as a zero-sum Markov game between a protagonist and an adversary to enhance policy robustness. However, the trainable nature of the adversary inevitably induces non-stationarity in the learning dynamics, leading to exacerbated training instability and convergence difficulties, particularly in high-dimensional complex environments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Uncertainty-Aware Critic Ensemble for robust adversarial Reinforcement learning (UACER), which consists of two strategies: 1) Diversified critic ensemble: a diverse set of K critic networks is exploited in parallel to stabilize Q-value estimation rather than conventional single-critic architectures for both variance reduction and robustness enhancement. 2) Time-varying Decay Uncertainty (TDU) mechanism: advancing beyond simple linear combinations, we develop a variance-derived Q-value aggregation strategy that explicitly incorporates epistemic uncertainty to dynamically regulate the exploration-exploitation trade-off while simultaneously stabilizing the training process. Comprehensive experiments across several MuJoCo control problems validate the superior effectiveness of UACER, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of overall performance, stability, and efficiency.

Abstract: Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL) faces a critical dilemma in balancing the use of a fixed offline dataset with newly collected online experiences. Standard methods, often relying on a fixed data-mixing ratio, struggle to manage the trade-off between early learning stability and asymptotic performance. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Replay Buffer (ARB), a novel approach that dynamically prioritizes data sampling based on a lightweight metric we call 'on-policyness'. Unlike prior methods that rely on complex learning procedures or fixed ratios, ARB is designed to be learning-free and simple to implement, seamlessly integrating into existing O2O RL algorithms. It assesses how closely collected trajectories align with the current policy's behavior and assigns a proportional sampling weight to each transition within that trajectory. This strategy effectively leverages offline data for initial stability while progressively focusing learning on the most relevant, high-rewarding online experiences. Our extensive experiments on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that ARB consistently mitigates early performance degradation and significantly improves the final performance of various O2O RL algorithms, highlighting the importance of an adaptive, behavior-aware replay buffer design.

Abstract: Recently, the disentangled latent space of a variational autoencoder (VAE) has been used to reason about multi-label out-of-distribution (OOD) test samples that are derived from different distributions than training samples. Disentangled latent space means having one-to-many maps between latent dimensions and generative factors or important characteristics of an image. This paper proposes a disentangled distilled encoder (DDE) framework to decrease the OOD reasoner size for deployment on resource-constrained devices while preserving disentanglement. DDE formalizes student-teacher distillation for model compression as a constrained optimization problem while preserving disentanglement with disentanglement constraints. Theoretical guarantees for disentanglement during distillation based on Rademacher complexity are established. The approach is evaluated empirically by deploying the compressed model on an NVIDIA

Abstract: A pre-trained unconditional diffusion model, combined with posterior sampling or maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation techniques, can solve arbitrary inverse problems without task-specific training or fine-tuning. However, existing posterior sampling and MAP estimation methods often rely on modeling approximations and can be computationally demanding. In this work, we propose the variational mode-seeking loss (VML), which, when minimized during each reverse diffusion step, guides the generated sample towards the MAP estimate. VML arises from a novel perspective of minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the diffusion posterior $p(\mathbf{x}_0|\mathbf{x}_t)$ and the measurement posterior $p(\mathbf{x}_0|\mathbf{y})$, where $\mathbf{y}$ denotes the measurement. Importantly, for linear inverse problems, VML can be analytically derived and need not be approximated. Based on further theoretical insights, we propose VML-MAP, an empirically effective algorithm for solving inverse problems, and validate its efficacy over existing methods in both performance and computational time, through extensive experiments on diverse image-restoration tasks across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Many state-of-the-art LLMs are trained to think before giving their answer. Reasoning can greatly improve language model capabilities and safety, but it also makes them less interactive: given a new input, a model must stop thinking before it can respond. Real-world use cases such as voice-based or embedded assistants require an LLM agent to respond and adapt to additional information in real time, which is incompatible with sequential interactions. In contrast, humans can listen, think, and act asynchronously: we begin thinking about the problem while reading it and continue thinking while formulating the answer. In this work, we augment LLMs capable of reasoning to operate in a similar way without additional training. Our method uses the properties of rotary embeddings to enable LLMs built for sequential interactions to simultaneously think, listen, and generate outputs. We evaluate our approach on math, commonsense, and safety reasoning and find that it can generate accurate thinking-augmented answers in real time, reducing time to first non-thinking token from minutes to <= 5s. and the overall real-time delays by 6-11x.

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache is the primary memory bottleneck in long-context Large Language Models, yet it is typically treated as an opaque numerical tensor. In this work, we propose \textbf{STA-Attention}, a framework that utilizes Top-K Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose the KV cache into interpretable ``semantic atoms.'' Unlike standard $L_1$-regularized SAEs, our Top-K approach eliminates shrinkage bias, preserving the precise dot-product geometry required for attention. Our analysis uncovers a fundamental \textbf{Key-Value Asymmetry}: while Key vectors serve as highly sparse routers dominated by a ``Semantic Elbow,'' deep Value vectors carry dense content payloads requiring a larger budget. Based on this structure, we introduce a Dual-Budget Strategy that selectively preserves the most informative semantic components while filtering representational noise. Experiments on Yi-6B, Mistral-7B, Qwen2.5-32B, and others show that our semantic reconstructions maintain perplexity and zero-shot performance comparable to the original models, effectively bridging the gap between mechanistic interpretability and faithful attention modeling.

Abstract: Although normalization layers have long been viewed as indispensable components of deep learning architectures, the recent introduction of Dynamic Tanh (DyT) has demonstrated that alternatives are possible. The point-wise function DyT constrains extreme values for stable convergence and reaches normalization-level performance; this work seeks further for function designs that can surpass it. We first study how the intrinsic properties of point-wise functions influence training and performance. Building on these findings, we conduct a large-scale search for a more effective function design. Through this exploration, we introduce $\mathrm{Derf}(x) = \mathrm{erf}(αx + s)$, where $\mathrm{erf}(x)$ is the rescaled Gaussian cumulative distribution function, and identify it as the most performant design. Derf outperforms LayerNorm, RMSNorm, and DyT across a wide range of domains, including vision (image recognition and generation), speech representation, and DNA sequence modeling. Our findings suggest that the performance gains of Derf largely stem from its improved generalization rather than stronger fitting capacity. Its simplicity and stronger performance make Derf a practical choice for normalization-free Transformer architectures.

Abstract: The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle facilitates effective representation learning by preserving label-relevant information while compressing irrelevant information. However, its strong reliance on accurate labels makes it inherently vulnerable to label noise, prevalent in real-world scenarios, resulting in significant performance degradation and overfitting. To address this issue, we propose LaT-IB, a novel Label-Noise ResistanT Information Bottleneck method which introduces a "Minimal-Sufficient-Clean" (MSC) criterion. Instantiated as a mutual information regularizer to retain task-relevant information while discarding noise, MSC addresses standard IB's vulnerability to noisy label supervision. To achieve this, LaT-IB employs a noise-aware latent disentanglement that decomposes the latent representation into components aligned with to the clean label space and the noise space. Theoretically, we first derive mutual information bounds for each component of our objective including prediction, compression, and disentanglement, and moreover prove that optimizing it encourages representations invariant to input noise and separates clean and noisy label information. Furthermore, we design a three-phase training framework: Warmup, Knowledge Injection and Robust Training, to progressively guide the model toward noise-resistant representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaT-IB achieves superior robustness and efficiency under label noise, significantly enhancing robustness and applicability in real-world scenarios with label noise.

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are effective for modeling Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs), which encode complex multi-typed entities and relations. However, HGNNs often suffer from type information loss and structural noise, limiting their representational fidelity and generalization. We propose THeGAU, a model-agnostic framework that combines a type-aware graph autoencoder with guided graph augmentation to improve node classification. THeGAU reconstructs schema-valid edges as an auxiliary task to preserve node-type semantics and introduces a decoder-driven augmentation mechanism to selectively refine noisy structures. This joint design enhances robustness, accuracy, and efficiency while significantly reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments on three benchmark HIN datasets (IMDB, ACM, and DBLP) demonstrate that THeGAU consistently outperforms existing HGNN methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple backbones.

Abstract: This thesis develops theoretical frameworks and algorithms that advance constrained reinforcement learning (RL) across control, preference learning, and alignment of large language models. The first contribution addresses constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) under the average-cost criterion through the Average-Constrained Policy Optimization (ACPO) algorithm. ACPO integrates sensitivity analysis with trust-region updates to ensure stable constraint handling, achieving state-of-the-art empirical performance with theoretical guarantees. Constrained RL is then extended to finite-horizon settings via e-COP, the first policy optimization method for episodic CMDPs. Built on an episodic policy difference lemma, e-COP offers provable performance, simplicity, and scalability in safety-critical environments. The thesis then investigates reinforcement learning from human preferences. warmPref-PS introduces a posterior sampling strategy for linear bandits that integrates offline preference data from heterogeneous raters into online learning. Explicit modeling of rater competence yields substantial regret reduction and more efficient data collection for RLHF. The PSPL algorithm further advances preference-based RL by jointly sampling reward models and transition dynamics from pairwise trajectory comparisons, providing Bayesian simple-regret guarantees and robust empirical identification of optimal policies. The final contribution applies these methods to large-scale model alignment. A multi-objective constrained optimization view yields MOPO, an iterative algorithm with closed-form updates that scales to multi-billion-parameter language models and remains robust across alignment settings. Collectively, the thesis unifies constrained RL across average-cost, episodic, and preference-driven paradigms, delivering theoretical advances and practical tools for safe and aligned decision-making.

Abstract: Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide principled uncertainty quantification but suffer from substantial computational and memory overhead compared to deterministic networks. While quantization techniques have successfully reduced resource requirements in standard deep learning models, their application to probabilistic models remains largely unexplored. We introduce a systematic multi-level quantization framework for Stochastic Variational Inference based BNNs that distinguishes between three quantization strategies: Variational Parameter Quantization (VPQ), Sampled Parameter Quantization (SPQ), and Joint Quantization (JQ). Our logarithmic quantization for variance parameters, and specialized activation functions to preserve the distributional structure are essential for calibrated uncertainty estimation. Through comprehensive experiments on Dirty-MNIST, we demonstrate that BNNs can be quantized down to 4-bit precision while maintaining both classification accuracy and uncertainty disentanglement. At 4 bits, Joint Quantization achieves up to 8x memory reduction compared to floating-point implementations with minimal degradation in epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimation. These results enable deployment of BNNs on resource-constrained edge devices and provide design guidelines for future analog "Bayesian Machines" operating at inherently low precision.

Abstract: As context windows in large language models continue to expand, it is essential to characterize how attention behaves at extreme sequence lengths. We introduce token-sample complexity: the rate at which attention computed on $n$ tokens converges to its infinite-token limit. We estimate finite-$n$ convergence bounds at two levels: pointwise uniform convergence of the attention map, and convergence of moments for the transformed token distribution. For compactly supported (and more generally sub-Gaussian) distributions, our first result shows that the attention map converges uniformly on a ball of radius $R$ at rate $C(R)/\sqrt{n}$, where $C(R)$ grows exponentially with $R$. For large $R$, this estimate loses practical value, and our second result addresses this issue by establishing convergence rates for the moments of the transformed distribution (the token output of the attention layer). In this case, the rate is $C'(R)/n^β$ with $β<\tfrac{1}{2}$, and $C'(R)$ depends polynomially on the size of the support of the distribution. The exponent $β$ depends on the attention geometry and the spectral properties of the tokens distribution. We also examine the regime in which the attention parameter tends to infinity and the softmax approaches a hardmax, and in this setting, we establish a logarithmic rate of convergence. Experiments on synthetic Gaussian data and real BERT models on Wikipedia text confirm our predictions.

Abstract: Outlier detection identifies data points that significantly deviate from the majority of the data distribution. Explaining outliers is crucial for understanding the underlying factors that contribute to their detection, validating their significance, and identifying potential biases or errors. Effective explanations provide actionable insights, facilitating preventive measures to avoid similar outliers in the future. Counterfactual explanations clarify why specific data points are classified as outliers by identifying minimal changes required to alter their prediction. Although valuable, most existing counterfactual explanation methods overlook the unique challenges posed by outlier detection, and fail to target classical, widely adopted outlier detection algorithms. Local Outlier Factor (LOF) is one the most popular unsupervised outlier detection methods, quantifying outlierness through relative local density. Despite LOF's widespread use across diverse applications, it lacks interpretability. To address this limitation, we introduce Density-based Counterfactuals for Outliers (DCFO), a novel method specifically designed to generate counterfactual explanations for LOF. DCFO partitions the data space into regions where LOF behaves smoothly, enabling efficient gradient-based optimisation. Extensive experimental validation on 50 OpenML datasets demonstrates that DCFO consistently outperforms benchmarked competitors, offering superior proximity and validity of generated counterfactuals.

Abstract: Compositional generalization -- the ability to understand and generate novel combinations of learned concepts -- enables models to extend their capabilities beyond limited experiences. While effective, the data structures and principles that enable this crucial capability remain poorly understood. We propose that compositional generalization fundamentally requires decomposing high-level concepts into basic, low-level concepts that can be recombined across similar contexts, similar to how humans draw analogies between concepts. For example, someone who has never seen a peacock eating rice can envision this scene by relating it to their previous observations of a chicken eating rice.
  In this work, we formalize these intuitive processes using principles of causal modularity and minimal changes. We introduce a hierarchical data-generating process that naturally encodes different levels of concepts and their interaction mechanisms. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this approach enables compositional generalization supporting complex relations between composed concepts, advancing beyond prior work that assumes simpler interactions like additive effects. Critically, we also prove that this latent hierarchical structure is provably recoverable (identifiable) from observable data like text-image pairs, a necessary step for learning such a generative process. To validate our theory, we apply insights from our theoretical framework and achieve significant improvements on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) offers a privacy-preserving paradigm for Edge AI scenarios like mobile health diagnostics, where sensitive multimodal data reside on distributed, resource-constrained devices.

This paper introduces HybridVFL, a novel framework designed to overcome this bottleneck by employing client-side feature disentanglement paired with a server-side cross-modal transformer for context-aware fusion. Through systematic evaluation on the multimodal HAM10000 skin lesion dataset, we demonstrate that HybridVFL significantly outperforms standard federated baselines, validating the criticality of advanced fusion mechanisms in robust, privacy-preserving systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have led to the development of Foundation Models (FMs) for weather forecasting, yet their ability to predict extreme weather events remains limited. Existing approaches either focus on general weather conditions or specialize in specific-type extremes, neglecting the real-world atmospheric patterns of diversified extreme events. In this work, we identify two key characteristics of extreme events: (1) the spectral disparity against normal weather regimes, and (2) the hierarchical drivers and geographic blending of diverse extremes. Along this line, we propose UniExtreme, a universal extreme weather forecasting foundation model that integrates (1) an Adaptive Frequency Modulation (AFM) module that captures region-wise spectral differences between normal and extreme weather, through learnable Beta-distribution filters and multi-granularity spectral aggregation, and (2) an Event Prior Augmentation (EPA) module which incorporates region-specific extreme event priors to resolve hierarchical extreme diversity and composite extreme schema, via a dual-level memory fusion network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniExtreme outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both extreme and general weather forecasting, showcasing superior adaptability across diverse extreme scenarios.

Abstract: Deep generative models, while revolutionizing fields like image and text generation, largely operate as opaque black boxes, hindering human understanding, control, and alignment. While methods like sparse autoencoders (SAEs) show remarkable empirical success, they often lack theoretical guarantees, risking subjective insights. Our primary objective is to establish a principled foundation for interpretable generative models. We demonstrate that the principle of causal minimality -- favoring the simplest causal explanation -- can endow the latent representations of diffusion vision and autoregressive language models with clear causal interpretation and robust, component-wise identifiable control. We introduce a novel theoretical framework for hierarchical selection models, where higher-level concepts emerge from the constrained composition of lower-level variables, better capturing the complex dependencies in data generation. Under theoretically derived minimality conditions (manifesting as sparsity or compression constraints), we show that learned representations can be equivalent to the true latent variables of the data-generating process. Empirically, applying these constraints to leading generative models allows us to extract their innate hierarchical concept graphs, offering fresh insights into their internal knowledge organization. Furthermore, these causally grounded concepts serve as levers for fine-grained model steering, paving the way for transparent, reliable systems.

Abstract: Neural operators offer powerful approaches for solving parametric partial differential equations, but extending them to spherical domains remains challenging due to the need to preserve intrinsic geometry while avoiding distortions that break rotational consistency. Existing spherical operators rely on rotational equivariance but often lack the flexibility for real-world complexity. We propose a general operator-design framework based on the designable spherical Green's function and its harmonic expansion, establishing a solid operator-theoretic foundation for spherical learning. Based on this, we propose an absolute and relative position-dependent Green's function that enables flexible balance of equivariance and invariance for real-world modeling. The resulting operator, Green's-function Spherical Neural Operator (GSNO) with a novel spectral learning method, can adapt to anisotropic, constraint-rich systems while retaining spectral efficiency. To exploit GSNO, we develop GSHNet, a hierarchical architecture that combines multi-scale spectral modeling with spherical up-down sampling, enhancing global feature representation. Evaluations on diffusion MRI, shallow water dynamics, and global weather forecasting, GSNO and GSHNet consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods. Our results position GSNO as a principled and general framework for spherical operator learning, bridging rigorous theory with real-world complexity.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a dominant paradigm for graph classification. Specifically, most existing GNNs mainly rely on the message passing strategy between neighbor nodes, where the expressivity is limited by the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test. Although a number of k-WL-based GNNs have been proposed to overcome this limitation, their computational cost increases rapidly with k, significantly restricting the practical applicability. Moreover, since the k-WL models mainly operate on node tuples, these k-WL-based GNNs cannot retain fine-grained node- or edge-level semantics required by attribution methods (e.g., Integrated Gradients), leading to the less interpretable problem. To overcome the above shortcomings, in this paper, we propose a novel Line Graph Aggregation Network (LGAN), that constructs a line graph from the induced subgraph centered at each node to perform the higher-order aggregation. We theoretically prove that the LGAN not only possesses the greater expressive power than the 2-WL under injective aggregation assumptions, but also has lower time complexity. Empirical evaluations on benchmarks demonstrate that the LGAN outperforms state-of-the-art k-WL-based GNNs, while offering better interpretability.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis reaction prediction seeks to infer plausible reactant molecules for a given product and is a central problem in computer-aided organic synthesis. Despite recent progress, many existing models still fall short of the accuracy and robustness required for practical deployment. This work studies a template-free, Transformer-based framework that eliminates reliance on handcrafted reaction templates or additional chemical rule engines. The model injects molecular graph information into the attention mechanism to jointly exploit \SMILES\ sequences and structural cues, and further applies a paired data augmentation strategy to enhance training diversity and scale. On the USPTO-50K benchmark, our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance among template-free methods and substantially outperforming a vanilla Transformer baseline.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) promise a unified approach for mechanistic interpretability, concept discovery, and model steering in LLMs and LVLMs. However, realizing this potential requires that the learned features be both interpretable and steerable. To that end, we introduce two new computationally inexpensive interpretability and steerability metrics and conduct a systematic analysis on LVLMs. Our analysis uncovers two observations; (i) a majority of SAE neurons exhibit either low interpretability or low steerability or both, rendering them ineffective for downstream use; and (ii) due to the unsupervised nature of SAEs, user-desired concepts are often absent in the learned dictionary, thus limiting their practical utility. To address these limitations, we propose Concept Bottleneck Sparse Autoencoders (CB-SAE) - a novel post-hoc framework that prunes low-utility neurons and augments the latent space with a lightweight concept bottleneck aligned to a user-defined concept set. The resulting CB-SAE improves interpretability by +32.1% and steerability by +14.5% across LVLMs and image generation tasks. We will make our code and model weights available.

Internal activation analysis reveals that NB2E induces bit-phase representations, enabling MLPs to learn and extrapolate signal structure independently of position.

Abstract: This paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework that enables controllable and diverse player behaviors without relying on human gameplay data. Existing approaches often require large-scale player trajectories, train separate models for different player types, or provide no direct mapping between interpretable behavioral parameters and the learned policy, limiting their scalability and controllability. We define player behavior in an N-dimensional continuous space and uniformly sample target behavior vectors from a region that encompasses the subset representing real human styles. During training, each agent receives both its current and target behavior vectors as input, and the reward is based on the normalized reduction in distance between them. This allows the policy to learn how actions influence behavioral statistics, enabling smooth control over attributes such as aggressiveness, mobility, and cooperativeness. A single PPO-based multi-agent policy can reproduce new or unseen play styles without retraining. Experiments conducted in a custom multi-player Unity game show that the proposed framework produces significantly greater behavioral diversity than a win-only baseline and reliably matches specified behavior vectors across diverse targets. The method offers a scalable solution for automated playtesting, game balancing, human-like behavior simulation, and replacing disconnected players in online games.

Abstract: Symbolic regression is a powerful tool for discovering governing equations directly from data, but its sensitivity to noise hinders its broader application. This paper introduces a Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) framework for Bayesian symbolic regression that approximates the posterior distribution over symbolic expressions, enhancing robustness and enabling uncertainty quantification for symbolic regression in the presence of noise. Differing from traditional genetic programming approaches, the SMC-based algorithm combines probabilistic selection, adaptive tempering, and the use of normalized marginal likelihood to efficiently explore the search space of symbolic expressions, yielding parsimonious expressions with improved generalization. When compared to standard genetic programming baselines, the proposed method better deals with challenging, noisy benchmark datasets. The reduced tendency to overfit and enhanced ability to discover accurate and interpretable equations paves the way for more robust symbolic regression in scientific discovery and engineering design applications.

Abstract: Transport-based methods have emerged as a leading paradigm for building generative models from large, clean datasets. However, in many scientific and engineering domains, clean data are often unavailable: instead, we only observe measurements corrupted through a noisy, ill-conditioned channel. A generative model for the original data thus requires solving an inverse problem at the level of distributions. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to this task based on Stochastic Interpolants: we iteratively update a transport map between corrupted and clean data samples using only access to the corrupted dataset as well as black box access to the corruption channel. Under appropriate conditions, this iterative procedure converges towards a self-consistent transport map that effectively inverts the corruption channel, thus enabling a generative model for the clean data. We refer to the resulting method as the self-consistent stochastic interpolant (SCSI). It (i) is computationally efficient compared to variational alternatives, (ii) highly flexible, handling arbitrary nonlinear forward models with only black-box access, and (iii) enjoys theoretical guarantees. We demonstrate superior performance on inverse problems in natural image processing and scientific reconstruction, and establish convergence guarantees of the scheme under appropriate assumptions.

Abstract: Modern LLM pre-training consumes vast amounts of compute and training data, making the scaling behavior, or scaling laws, of different models a key distinguishing factor. Discrete diffusion language models (DLMs) have been proposed as an alternative to autoregressive language models (ALMs). However, their scaling behavior has not yet been fully explored, with prior work suggesting that they require more data and compute to match the performance of ALMs.
  We study the scaling behavior of DLMs on different noise types by smoothly interpolating between masked and uniform diffusion while paying close attention to crucial hyperparameters such as batch size and learning rate. Our experiments reveal that the scaling behavior of DLMs strongly depends on the noise type and is considerably different from ALMs. While all noise types converge to similar loss values in compute-bound scaling, we find that uniform diffusion requires more parameters and less data for compute-efficient training compared to masked diffusion, making them a promising candidate in data-bound settings. We scale our uniform diffusion model up to 10B parameters trained for $10^{22}$ FLOPs, confirming the predicted scaling behavior and making it the largest publicly known uniform diffusion model to date.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models achieve strong performance across language and other discrete domains, providing a powerful alternative to autoregressive models. However, their strong performance relies on large training datasets, which are costly or risky to obtain, especially when adapting to new domains. Transfer learning is the natural way to adapt pretrained discrete diffusion models, but current methods require fine-tuning large diffusion models, which is computationally expensive and often impractical. Building on ratio-based transfer learning for continuous diffusion, we provide Guided Transfer Learning for discrete diffusion models (GTL). This enables sampling from a target distribution without modifying the pretrained denoiser. The same guidance formulation applies to both discrete-time diffusion and continuous-time score-based discrete diffusion, yielding a unified treatment. Guided discrete diffusion often requires many forward passes of the guidance network, which becomes impractical for large vocabularies and long sequences. To address this, we further present an efficient guided sampler that concentrates evaluations on planner-selected positions and top candidate tokens, thus lowering sampling time and computation. This makes guided language modeling practical at scale for large vocabularies and long sequences. We evaluate GTL on sequential data, including synthetic Markov chains and language modeling, and provide empirical analyses of its behavior.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations provide actionable insights by identifying minimal input changes required to achieve a desired model prediction. Beyond their interpretability benefits, counterfactuals can also be leveraged for model reconstruction, where a surrogate model is trained to replicate the behavior of a target model. In this work, we demonstrate that model reconstruction can be significantly improved by recognizing that counterfactuals, which typically lie close to the decision boundary, can serve as informative though less representative samples for both classes. This is particularly beneficial in settings with limited access to labeled data. We propose a method that integrates original data samples with counterfactuals to approximate class prototypes using the Wasserstein barycenter, thereby preserving the underlying distributional structure of each class. This approach enhances the quality of the surrogate model and mitigates the issue of decision boundary shift, which commonly arises when counterfactuals are naively treated as ordinary training instances. Empirical results across multiple datasets show that our method improves fidelity between the surrogate and target models, validating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Parabolic trough Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plants operate large hydraulic networks of collector loops that must deliver a uniform outlet temperature despite spatially heterogeneous optical performance, heat losses, and pressure drops. While loop temperatures are measured, loop-level mass flows and receiver heat-loss parameters are unobserved, making it impossible to diagnose hydraulic imbalances or receiver degradation using standard monitoring tools.
  We present a physics-informed learning framework that infers (i) loop-level mass-flow ratios and (ii) time-varying receiver heat-transfer coefficients directly from routine operational data. The method exploits nocturnal homogenization periods -- when hot oil is circulated through a non-irradiated field -- to isolate hydraulic and thermal-loss effects. A differentiable conjugate heat-transfer model is discretized and embedded into an end-to-end learning pipeline optimized using historical plant data from the 50 MW Andasol 3 solar field.
  The model accurately reconstructs loop temperatures (RMSE $<2^\circ$C) and produces physically meaningful estimates of loop imbalances and receiver heat losses. Comparison against drone-based infrared thermography (QScan) shows strong correspondence, correctly identifying all areas with high-loss receivers. This demonstrates that noisy real-world CSP operational data contain enough information to recover latent physical parameters when combined with appropriate modeling and differentiable optimization.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The resource requirements of Neural Networks can be significantly reduced through pruning -- the removal of seemingly less important parameters. However, with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), full retraining to recover pruning-induced performance degradation is often prohibitive and classical approaches such as global magnitude pruning are suboptimal on Transformer architectures. State-of-the-art methods hence solve a layer-wise mask selection problem, the problem of finding a pruning mask which minimizes the per-layer pruning error on a small set of calibration data. Exactly solving this problem to optimality using Integer Programming (IP) solvers is computationally infeasible due to its combinatorial nature and the size of the search space, and existing approaches therefore rely on approximations or heuristics. In this work, we demonstrate that the mask selection problem can be made drastically more tractable at LLM scale. To that end, we decouple the rows by enforcing equal sparsity levels per row. This allows us to derive optimal 1-swaps (exchanging one kept and one pruned weight) that can be computed efficiently using the Gram matrix of the calibration data. Using these observations, we propose a tractable and simple 1-swap algorithm that warm starts from any pruning mask, runs efficiently on GPUs at LLM scale, and is essentially hyperparameter-free. We demonstrate that our approach reduces per-layer pruning error by up to 60% over Wanda (Sun et al., 2023) and consistently improves perplexity and zero-shot accuracy across state-of-the-art GPT architectures.

Abstract: The construction of adversarial attacks for neural networks appears to be a crucial challenge for their deployment in various services. To estimate the adversarial robustness of a neural network, a fast and efficient approach is needed to construct adversarial attacks. Since the formalization of adversarial attack construction involves solving a specific optimization problem, we consider the problem of constructing an efficient and effective adversarial attack from a numerical optimization perspective. Specifically, we suggest utilizing advanced projection-free methods, known as modified Frank-Wolfe methods, to construct white-box adversarial attacks on the given input data. We perform a theoretical and numerical evaluation of these methods and compare them with standard approaches based on projection operations or geometrical intuition. Numerical experiments are performed on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, utilizing a multiclass logistic regression model, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and the Vision Transformer (ViT).

Abstract: The success of modern machine learning hinges on access to high-quality training data. In many real-world scenarios, such as acquiring data from public repositories or sharing across institutions, data is naturally organized into discrete datasets that vary in relevance, quality, and utility. Selecting which repositories or institutions to search for useful datasets, and which datasets to incorporate into model training are therefore critical decisions, yet most existing methods select individual samples and treat all data as equally relevant, ignoring differences between datasets and their sources. In this work, we formalize the task of dataset selection: selecting entire datasets from a large, heterogeneous pool to improve downstream performance under resource constraints. We propose Dataset Selection via Hierarchies (DaSH), a dataset selection method that models utility at both dataset and group (e.g., collections, institutions) levels, enabling efficient generalization from limited observations. Across two public benchmarks (Digit-Five and DomainNet), DaSH outperforms state-of-the-art data selection baselines by up to 26.2% in accuracy, while requiring significantly fewer exploration steps. Ablations show DaSH is robust to low-resource settings and lack of relevant datasets, making it suitable for scalable and adaptive dataset selection in practical multi-source learning workflows.

Abstract: Normalizing Flows (NFs) have been established as a principled framework for generative modeling. Standard NFs consist of a forward process and a reverse process: the forward process maps data to noise, while the reverse process generates samples by inverting it. Typical NF forward transformations are constrained by explicit invertibility, ensuring that the reverse process can serve as their exact analytic inverse. Recent developments in TARFlow and its variants have revitalized NF methods by combining Transformers and autoregressive flows, but have also exposed causal decoding as a major bottleneck. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Normalizing Flow ($\textbf{BiFlow}$), a framework that removes the need for an exact analytic inverse. BiFlow learns a reverse model that approximates the underlying noise-to-data inverse mapping, enabling more flexible loss functions and architectures. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that BiFlow, compared to its causal decoding counterpart, improves generation quality while accelerating sampling by up to two orders of magnitude. BiFlow yields state-of-the-art results among NF-based methods and competitive performance among single-evaluation ("1-NFE") methods. Following recent encouraging progress on NFs, we hope our work will draw further attention to this classical paradigm.

The system is structured around three interlinked agents Prediction, Planning, and Execution, which collaboratively enable real time situational awareness, response planning, and intervention. By incorporating local environmental factors and operationalizing multi agent coordination, this approach offers a scalable and proactive solution for climate resilient disaster preparedness across vulnerable mountainous terrains.

Abstract: We report on the structural evolution, spin phonon interactions, and magnetoelastic effects in bulk LaFeO3 perovskite across its antiferromagnetic transition. We found that while the lattice constants exhibit slight deviations at the Neel temperature(TN), due to spin phonon interactions, individual interatomic bonds display distinct behavior. The octahedral B site basal plane, involving oxygen ion pairs that mediate superexchange interactions, displays bond contraction (or elongation) assimilable to the observed in x ray diffraction for negative thermal expansion. These bond deviations reach a singular point near TN, where a sharp change in bond length is observed. A similar abrupt change is also detected in the nearest neighbor La O2 basal plane distances, which we interpret as arising from ion size differences within the 3d 2p hybridized states associated with the superexchange mechanism. High-resolution SXRD measurements of the c-axis Fe3+ O1 and La3+ O1 apex distances reveal a distinct inflection at the Neel temperature. This behavior supports the role of lattice distortions and crystal field modifications in the emergence of non collinear weak ferromagnetism in RFeO3 (R = rare earth) perovskites. Furthermore, our SXRD patterns show an increase in diffraction line intensities peaking at TN, suggesting a straightforward indicator for spin-phonon interactions that also resolves into lattice metastability deduced by nonlinear thermal expansion in the paramagnetic phase. Preliminary results across the full RFeO3 (R = rare earth) series indicate a shared structural framework among all members, potentially offering insights into previously inconclusive structural interpretations in oxides with common octahedral sublattices.

Abstract: The exploration of topological phase transition (TPT) mechanisms constitutes a central theme in quantum materials research. Conventionally, transitions between Weyl semimetals (WSMs) and other topological states rely on the breaking of time-reversal symmetry (TRS) or precise manipulation of lattice symmetry, thus constraints the available control strategies and restrict the scope of viable material systems. In this work, we propose a novel mechanism for TPT that operates without TRS breaking or lattice symmetry modification: a class of semiconductors can be directly transformed into an ideal WSM via bandgap closure. This transition is driven by chemical doping, which simultaneously modulates the band gap and enhances spin-orbit coupling (SOC), leading to band inversion between the valence and conduction bands and thereby triggering the TPT. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the feasibility of this mechanism in the Cu$_2$SnSe$_3$ family of materials, where two pairs of Weyl points emerge with energies extremely close to the Fermi level. The bulk Fermi surface becomes nearly point-like, while the surface Fermi surface consists exclusively of Fermi arcs. This symmetry-independent mechanism bypasses the constraints of conventional symmetry-based engineering, and also offers an ideal platform for probing the anomalous transport properties of WSMs.

Abstract: ZrTe5 is a highly tunable, high-mobility topological material that hosts a rich variety of quantum phenomena, making it a promising platform for next-generation quantum technologies. Despite intensive research efforts, experimental studies have reported inconsistent and sometimes conflicting results for its electronic and topological states, largely due to variations in sample quality. Here, through systematic frst-principles investigations of all intrinsic point defects, we identify a practical route to achieving stable and ideal topological characteristics in ZrTe5. We show that the competition between two dominant charged defects, donor-like Zr interstitials and acceptor-like Te vacancies, governs the Fermi-level position. Furthermore, variations in defect density determine the topological phases of the samples. We theoretically propose and experimentally confrm that increasing the Te/Zr ratio during crystal growth effectively suppresses intrinsic defects and stabilizes ZrTe5 in a nearly ideal weak topological insulator state. These fndings provide clear guidance for defect control and sample optimization, paving the way toward robust and reproducible realization of topological quantum states in ZrTe5 for future quantum applications.

Abstract: Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) is a fundamental technique for probing magnetization dynamics in spintronic and magnetic materials. However, conventional FMR measurements rely on broadband vector network analyzers (VNAs), whose high cost limits accessibility for small laboratories and educational environments. To overcome this barrier, we have developed a compact and low-cost FMR measurement platform - the NanoVNA-FMR system-based on a commercially available NanoVNA. The setup integrates an electromagnet and a coplanar waveguide (CPW) and is fully automated using Python scripts. This enables synchronized magnetic-field sweeping, S-parameter acquisition, and real-time visualization. The system successfully captures clear FMR spectra that exhibit systematic shifts in resonance frequency with increasing magnetic field. The results are in excellent agreement with those obtained using a conventional VNA-based FMR system, confirming the quantitative reliability of the NanoVNA approach. Additionally, a 3D-printed sample holder further reduces overall system cost. These results demonstrate that the NanoVNA-FMR system provides a practical, accurate, and accessible alternative for quantitative magnetic characterization and educational applications.

Abstract: Deep learning potentials for complex many-body systems often face challenges of insufficient accuracy and a lack of physical realism. This paper proposes an "Observable-Constrained Variational Framework" (OCVF), a general top-down correction paradigm designed to infuse physical realism into theoretical "skeleton" models (H_o) by imposing constraints from macroscopic experimental observables (\mathfrak{O}_{\text{exp},s}). We theoretically derive OCVF as a numerically tractable extension of the "Constrained-Ensemble Variational Method" (CEVM), wherein a neural network (ΔH_θ) learns the correction functional required to match the experimental data. We apply OCVF to BaTiO3 (BTO) to validate the framework: a neural network potential trained on DFT data serves as H_o, and experimental PDF data at various temperatures are used as constraints (\mathfrak{O}{\text{exp},s}). The final model, H_o + ΔH_θ, successfully predicts the complete phase transition sequence accurately (s', s \neq s'). Compared to the prior model, the accuracy of the Cubic-Tetragonal (C-T) phase transition temperature is improved by 95.8\% , and the Orthorhombic-Rhombohedral (O-R) T_c accuracy is improved by 36.1\%. Furthermore, the lattice structure accuracy in the Rhombohedral (R) phase is improved by 55.6\%, validating the efficacy of the OCVF framework in calibrating theoretical models via observational constraints.

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions with ultrasmall nanometric dimensions hold significant promise for next-generation high-density spintronic devices. Direct real-space imaging of these topological spin textures is critical for elucidating their emergent properties at the nanoscale. Here, we present Lorentz transmission electron microscopy studies of nanometric skyrmion lattices in B20-structured Mn0.5Fe0.5Ge crystals using Fresnel mode. According to conventional chiral discrimination methods relying on static bright-dark contrast, we demonstrate an abnormal periodic chiral-reversal phenomenon retrieved through the transport of intensity equation analysis of defocus-dependent Fresnel images. Through systematic off-axis electron holography experiments and numerical simulations, we attribute these chiral misinterpretations to the sinusoidal modulation mechanism of the contrast transfer functionthat correlates with both defocus values and skyrmion dimensions. Our findings establish quantitative limitations of conventional Fresnel contrast analysis for ultrasmall skyrmions while revealing fundamental insights into defocus-mediated phase-to-intensity conversion processes in nanoscale magnetic imaging.

Abstract: Altermagnets represent a novel magnetic phase with transformative potential for ultrafast spintronics, yet efficient control of their magnetic states remains challenging. We demonstrate an ultra-low-power electric-field control of altermagnetism in MnTe through strain-mediated coupling in MnTe/PMN-PT heterostructures with negligible Joule heating. Application of +6 kV/cm electric fields induces piezoelectric strain in PMN-PT, modulating the Néel temperature from 310 to 328 K. As a result, around the magnetic phase transition, the altermagnetic spin splitting of MnTe is reversibly switched "on" and "off" by the electric fields. Meanwhile, the piezoelectric strain generates lattice distortions and magnetic structure changes in MnTe, enabling up to 9.7% resistance modulation around the magnetic phase transition temperature. Leveraging this effect, we implement programmable resistance states in a Hopfield neuromorphic network, achieving 100% pattern recognition accuracy at <=40% noise levels. This approach establishes the electric-field control as a low-power strategy for altermagnetic manipulation while demonstrating the viability of altermagnetic materials for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing beyond conventional charge-based architectures.

Abstract: In a collinear magnet, the predominant magnetic moments are collectively aligned along a specific spatial orientation, and this alignment may yield intriguing phenomena such as spin orientation driven polarization. It is well known that spin orientation driven polarization is a relativistic effect that widely occurs in various type-II multiferroics. However, a universal theory that describes such a phenomenon and directs the corresponding materials discovery is lacking. Here, we revisit the magnetic structures of collinear magnets and explore the spin-orientation-dependent phenomena therein. Based on symmetry principles, we analyze the spin point groups (SPGs) that are associated with collinear magnets in the non-relativistic regime, demonstrate how relativistic spin-orbit interaction reduces each SPG to various magnetic point groups that are associated with different magnetic alignments, and classify the SPGs with respect to spin orientation driven polarization. We employ our theory to elucidate the mechanisms of spin orientation driven polarization in a variety of type-II multiferroics. Combined with first-principles simulations, we further show that polarization may be driven in nonpolar collinear antiferromagnets (e.g., CuFeS$_2$) by reorienting their magnetic alignments. Our theory provides guidelines for designing and discovering materials with spin orientation driven polarization, which will benefit the development of spintronics based on type-II multiferroics and related materials.

Abstract: Electric field induced spin-orbit torques are the crucial mechanism for electric regulations of antiferromagnetic order. However, the spin-orbit torques in antiferromagnets and the induced spin dynamics remain largely unexplored. In this work, the full classifications of SOTs in bulk collinear AFMs have been achieved based on magnetic point group. Dependent on the symmetries connecting the opposite spin sublattices, the SOTs are classified into six distinct types. Among them, the SOTs and the induced Neel vector dynamics in three representative AFMs have been investigated, where the spin sublattices are connected by fractional translation, spatial inversion, and neither by translation nor inversion symmetry respectively. The SOTs on spin sublattices have been calculated by first-principles calculations based on Kubo linear response theory, and then the induced spin dynamics are simulated by LLG equations. In typical PT symmetric AFM and the inversion symmetry breaking altermagnet, the simulations indicate that the deterministic switching of Neel vectors can be driven by field like torques. What's more, the fully electric writing of multiple antiferromagnetic domains into single domain state with preset Neel vector direction and 180 deterministic switching may also be realized. Our work may shed light on the current control of antiferromagnetic orders in collinear AFMs. Especially, for inversion symmetry breaking altermagnet, the electric writing and reading of Neel vector are highly desirable for antiferromagnetic memory applications.

Abstract: Colloidal epitaxial heterostructures are nanoparticles composed of two different materials connected at an interface, which can exhibit properties different from those of their individual components. Combining dissimilar materials offers opportunities to create several functional heterostructures. Yet, assessing structural compatibility (the main prerequisite for epitaxial growth) is challenging when pairing complex materials with different lattice parameters/crystal structures. This complicates both the selection of target heterostructures for synthesis and the assignment of interface models when new heterostructures are obtained. Here, we demonstrate Ogre as a powerful tool to accelerate the design and characterization of colloidal heterostructures. To this end we implemented developments tailored for the efficient prediction of epitaxial interfaces between ionic/polar materials, which encompass most colloidal semiconductors. These include pre-screening candidate models based on charge balance at the interface and using a classical potential for fast energy evaluations, with parameters automatically extracted from the input bulk structures. These developments are validated for CsPbBr3/Pb4S3Br2 heterostructures, where Ogre produces interface models in agreement with density functional theory and experiments. Furthermore, we use Ogre to rationalize the templating effect of CsPbCl3 on the growth of lead sulfochlorides, where perovskite seeds induce the formation of Pb4S3Cl2 rather than Pb3S2Cl2 due to better epitaxial compatibility. Combining Ogre simulations with experimental data enables us to unravel the structure and composition of the hitherto unsolved CsPbBr3/BixPbySz interface and assign a structure to many other reported metal halide/oxide based interfaces. The Ogre package is available on GitHub or via the OgreInterface desktop application, available for Windows, Linux and Mac.

In this work we study the alloy of the widely used AlN with SiC for their relative abundance, current use in other electronics applications and expected phase competition between wurtzite and other polymorphs, the kind of which has lead to some of the most interesting results notably between AlN and ScN. Here the pseudo-binary (SiC)(AlN) alloy is studied from first-principles over the entire composition range. Relevant crystalline phases are identified using the First-Principles Random Structure Sampling approach which, in accordance with previous bulk experiments, finds wurtzite, zincblende and rhombohedral phases to be the only statistically relevant phases of the alloy. Further study of these phases is done through Special Quasi-random Structures (SQS) and, in the case of the wurtzite phase, predictions of the stiffness, piezoelectric and dielectric tensors. Analysis of these tensors is done through the scope of a Bulk AcousticWave (BAW) filter application, where trends and trade-offs between the c-axis acoustic velocity and piezoelectric response enable identification of relevant compositions.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic oxides are increasingly studied for their multifunctional potential in fields like spintronics, optoelectronics, and energy conversion. In this research, we conduct a detailed first-principles study of pure monolayer Fe3O4 and its modification through Zr adsorption at two sites: on top of an Fe atom and at the bridge between Fe atoms. Using spin-polarized density functional theory with the GGA plus U method, we examine how adsorption affects structure, electronic, magnetic, optical, elastic, and piezoelectric properties. The original monolayer shows half-metallicity, strong spin polarization, and a moderate in-plane piezoelectric effect. Zr adsorption causes local lattice distortions and orbital hybridization, resulting in intermediate electronic states, a reduced bandgap, and increased optical absorption in both spin channels. Notably, Zr at the bridge site greatly enhances dielectric response, optical conductivity, and piezoelectric coefficients, tripling e11 compared to the pristine layer. Elastic constants indicate mechanical softening after functionalization, and energy loss spectra display shifts in plasmon resonance. These findings suggest Zr adsorption offers a controllable, non-destructive way to tune spin, charge, and lattice interactions in Fe4O4 monolayers, connecting magnetic, optical, and piezoelectric functionalities within a single 2D material platform.

Abstract: Elemental antimony (Sb) is a promising material for phase-change memory, neuromorphic computing and nanophotonic applications, because its compositional simplicity can prevent phase segregation upon extensive programming. Scaling down the film thickness is a necessary step to prolong the lifetime of amorphous Sb, but the optical properties of Sb are also significantly altered as the thickness is reduced to a few nanometers, adding complexity to device optimization. In this work, we aim to provide atomistic understanding of the thickness-dependent optical responses in Sb thin films. As thickness decreases, both the extinction coefficient and optical contrast reduce in the near-infrared spectrum, consistent with previous optical measurements. Such thickness dependence gives rise to a bottom thickness limit of 2 nm in photonic applications, as predicted by coarse-grained device simulations. Further bonding analysis reveals a fundamentally different behavior for amorphous and crystalline Sb upon downscaling, resulting in the reduction of optical contrast. Thin film experiments are also carried out to validate our predictions. The thickness-dependent optical trend is fully demonstrated by our ellipsometric spectroscopy experiments, and the bottom thickness limit of 2 nm is confirmed by structural characterization experiments. Finally, we show that the greatly improved amorphous-phase stability of the 2 nm Sb thin film enables robust and reversible optical switching in a silicon-based waveguide device.

This study gives a comprehensive analysis of the bulk, surface (001), and Ge-Sn-terminated interfaces within GGA and mGGA functionals. Interestingly, the inherent asymmetric arrangements of the systems exhibit remarkable optoelectronic and piezoelectric properties. The piezoelectric performance of each surface cut has been validated through the electromechanical coupling calculation.

One class of materials where this is surely the case are materials with strong microstructural disorder such as random composites, random porous materials or disordered metamaterials. For this class of materials we propose an intermediately-homogenized peridynamic modelling approach where the disordered microstructure is not resolved in full spatial detail but described in terms of random order parameter fields which retain essential information about the local heterogeneity and spatial correlations of material properties.

Abstract: Epitaxial strain plays a key role in determining the structure and functionality of thin films, with the choice of substrate being traditionally used to control the magnitude of the applied strain. However, even in the large family of perovskite materials, this allows for only a limited, discrete set of strain states to be achieved. Here we report on an approach to controlling epitaxial strain for the growth of perovskite materials by involving a single SrTiO$_{3}$ substrate (the most available perovskite in single crystal form) and a buffer layer that consists of the solid solution Sr(Sn, Ge)$_{x}$Ti$_{1-x}$O$_{3}$, of which the lattice parameter can be tuned in a continuous fashion, from 3.880 Å up to 4.007 Å, while maintaining coherent epitaxial growth on SrTiO$_{3}$ with high quality interfaces. Using a BaTiO$_{3}$ overlayer as a model system, we show that changes to the buffer layer composition, i.e. increase of in-plane lattice parameter, change the strain state of BaTiO$_{3}$ from fully relaxed, through highly compressively strained, to an exotic state showing 'inverted' epitaxy in which the buffer layer is relaxed from the substrate but lattice matched to the overlayer.

Abstract: Ferroelastic domain walls (DWs) underpin key functionalities in complex oxides. In free-standing ferroic thin films, where elastic interactions are highly thickness dependent, understanding DW behaviour across length scales and external stimuli is crucial. A thickness-dependent monopolar-to-dipolar crossover in elastic DW behaviour has been reported; however, how temperature influences this regime remains unexplored. Here, LaAlO3 thin films spanning the dipolar ($<200$ nm) and crossover (200-300 nm) regimes are investigated using in situ heating scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and a machine-learning-driven image analysis approach. By tracking DW curvature and density from above $T_C$ (approximately $550,^\circ$C) to room temperature (RT), a distinct interplay between temperature and thickness is identified. In the dipolar regime, DWs are mobile and curved near $T_C$ and gradually freeze upon cooling, consistent with the well-known temperature freezing regime. In contrast, within the crossover regime, DWs are nearly static, with minimal reconfiguration through cooling and curvature an order of magnitude lower at RT. These results map the evolution of DWs across the thermally driven super-elastic to freezing regimes, revealing how thickness and temperature govern DW morphology and dynamics, and providing insight relevant for domain engineering in free-standing oxide thin films.

Abstract: Wide band gap materials are particularly relevant at high temperatures. The band gap shrinkage at higher temperatures prevents device applications with narrow band gap semiconductors. Considering $α$-phase strontium cyanurate as a prototype structure, we identify a group of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) that exhibit ultra-wide band gaps ranging from 5.5 to 5.7 eV. Recently, a strontium cyanurate compound was found to undergo a phase transition from a high-symmetry $β$-phase to a low-symmetry ferroelectric $α$-phase when the temperature was reduced. In the present study, utilizing group theory techniques, we unravel that a zone-center $Γ_2^-$ phonon mode modifies our structures from high-symmetry $β$-phase to a low-symmetry $α$-phase for A$_3$(O$_3$C$_3$N$_3$)$_2$ MOFs with A = Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba. We implement first-principles calculations to investigate structural, ferroelectric, and optical properties of these compounds in $α$-phase. The switching barriers between bistable polar states are also estimated. Further, to realize their feasibility, we examine the dynamical and thermal stabilities for all of these MOFs.

Abstract: This work presents a simple scheme for finding new crystalline compounds by adapting structure types from neighbor atoms compounds. The approach is demonstrated for the selenide and sulfide families of binary compounds. It predicts ten new compounds that are not currently included in the inorganic crystal structure database (ICSD). The compounds primarily originated from a small search domain that includes near neighbors. Comparison with extended searches that include structures from binary systems of more remote atoms in the periodic table demonstrate the relative efficiency of near neighbor screening. This points at the possibility of using similar directed searches as a heuristic rule for efficiently finding new stable compounds in additional compound families.

Abstract: While 2D materials have enormous potential for future device technologies, many challenges must be overcome before they can be deployed at an industrial scale. One of these challenges is identifying the right semiconductor/insulator combination that ensures high performance, stability, and reliability. In contrast to conventional 2D interfaces, which suffer from van der Waals gaps or covalent bonding issues, zippered structures such as the high-mobility 2D semiconductor Bi$_2$O$_2$Se and its native high-$κ$ oxide Bi$_2$SeO$_5$ offer high-quality interfaces, good scalability, and excellent device performance. While most prior work has focused mainly on basic device behavior, here we also thoroughly assess the stability and reliability of this material system using a multiscale approach that integrates electrical characterization, density functional theory, and TCAD simulations, linking atomistic states to device-scale reliability. By analyzing four transistor design generations (top-gated, fin, and two gate-all-around FETs), we provide realistic predictions for how this system performs at the ultimate scaling limit. We identify oxygen-related defects in the oxide as the main contributors to hysteresis and recoverable threshold shifts, and we propose mitigation strategies through encapsulation or oxygen-rich annealing. Benchmarking the extracted material parameters against IRDS 2037 requirements, we demonstrate that Bi$_2$O$_2$Se/Bi$_2$SeO$_5$ transistors can achieve high drain and low gate currents at ultra-scaled conditions. These findings position this material system as a technologically credible and manufacturing-relevant pathway for future nanoelectronics.

Abstract: Donor-acceptor type compounds are an important category of organic materials that show properties suitable for light emission applications. To achieve a full understanding of the mechanism of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) process, we studied the structure-property relationship for a series of carbazole based TADF emitters, 2CzPN, 4CzPN, 4CzIPN, 4CzBN and 5CzBN. We applied density functional theory to investigate kinetic and electronic properties. We find that the energetic position of triplet excited state of these emitters depends on their molecular structure. Our findings emphasize that to enable reverse intersystem crossing and eventually TADF, strong spin orbit coupling and minimal energy difference between singlet and triplet states $ΔE_{ST}$ must be obtained simultaneously. We also find that the reverse intersystem crossing rates $k_{RISC}$ values are higher where $ΔE_{ST}$ values are closer to reorganization energy. Furthermore, a small change in the absorption peak of optical absorption spectra with and without spin orbit coupling (SOC) is observed for each emitter. This result is extremely beneficial for the design of new TADF molecules, and we believe that our work contributes to the progress of future development of high-performance organic molecular light-emitting devices.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for automated data extraction and property prediction across materials science, yet their use in superconductivity research remains limited. Here we construct a large experimental database of 78,203 records, covering 19,058 unique compositions, extracted from scientific literature using an LLM-driven workflow. Each entry includes chemical composition, critical temperature, measurement pressure, structural descriptors, and critical fields. We fine-tune several open-source LLMs for three tasks: (i) classifying superconductors vs. non-superconductors, (ii) predicting the superconducting transition temperature directly from composition or structure-informed inputs, and (iii) inverse design of candidate compositions conditioned on target Tc. The fine-tuned LLMs achieve performance comparable to traditional feature-based models and in some cases exceed them, while substantially outperforming their base versions and capturing meaningful chemical and structural trends. The inverse-design model generates chemically plausible compositions, including 28% novel candidates not seen in training. Finally, applying the trained predictors to the GNoME database identifies unreported materials with predicted Tc > 10 K. Although unverified, these candidates illustrate how integrating an LLM-driven workflow can enable scalable hypothesis generation for superconductivity discovery.

Abstract: Spin-gapless semiconductors (SGSs) that simultaneously host fully compensated ferrimagnetism are highly sought for energy-efficient and stray-field-free spintronic technologies, yet their realization in chemically disordered systems has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the binary Heusler alloy Cr3Al despite adopting a fully A2-disordered structure exhibits a rare coexistence of SGS transport and a fully compensated ferrimagnetic (FCF) ground state. Single-crystalline and polycrystalline Cr3Al samples were synthesized, and comprehensive structural analyses using single crystal XRD, synchrotron powder XRD, and neutron powder diffraction reveal complete Cr/Al site mixing. Remarkably, this chemical disorder does not disrupt magnetic order; instead, magnetization, X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), and temperature-dependent neutron diffraction establish a robust compensated ferrimagnetic state with a vanishingly small ordered moment of 0.1(1) muB/f.u and a high Curie temperature of 773(2) K. Electrical and thermal transport measurements uncover clear SGS characteristics, including weak temperature-dependent conductivity, very low Seebeck coefficients, and electron-hole compensated transport. Hall measurements show unusual temperature-dependent carrier concentrations consistent with disorder-modified electronic states. First-principles calculations on an A2-disordered SQS structure reproduce the experimentally observed negligibly small magnetization (0.0072 muB/f.u) and reveal a vanishing spin-up band gap unambiguously supporting SGS behavior driven by chemical disorder. Our results identify Cr3Al as the first experimentally verified A2-disordered Heusler alloy exhibiting both fully compensated ferrimagnetism and spin-gapless semiconducting transport, positioning it as a robust and disorder-tolerant platform for next-generation, high-temperature spintronic devices.

Abstract: Germanium magnesium-telluroborate glasses with the composition 78B2O3-10GeO2-5TeO2-7-x MgO-xTm2O3, x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 mol% were fabricated by using the melt quenching process. With the increase of Tm2O3 concentration, the density values increase from 3.574 to 4.153 g.cm-1, while the molar volume values decrease from 21.145 to 19.445 cm3/mol. Fourier transform infrared analysis supports the existence and conversion of BO3 and BO4. The conversion of BO3 to BO4 would lead to greater bridging oxygens BOs, influencing and reinforcing the glass network. The optical features were studied. The optical band gap decreased by increasing Tm2O3 content in the glass formula, while the index of refraction increased. The parameters take the values between 3.16 eV and 2.31 eV. Other optical and physical constants were determined like optical conductivity, electronegativity, metallization, reflection loss, steepness parameters, and transmission coefficient. Judd-Ofelt theory is used to estimate the optical intensities and line strengths of the present glasses. Radiative lifetimes and branching ratios are evaluated of different manifolds belonging to Tm3+ doped present glasses. The results showed the possibility of potential applications for these materials in the fields of laser development, Light-emitting diodes (LEDs), optical amplification and optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: Learning is most effective when it's connected to relevant, relatable examples that resonate with learners on a personal level. However, existing educational AI tools don't focus on generating examples or adapting to learners' changing understanding, struggles, or growing skills. We've developed ExaCraft, an AI system that generates personalized examples by adapting to the learner's dynamic context. Through the Google Gemini AI and Python Flask API, accessible via a Chrome extension, ExaCraft combines user-defined profiles (including location, education, profession, and complexity preferences) with real-time analysis of learner behavior. This ensures examples are both culturally relevant and tailored to individual learning needs. The system's core innovation is its ability to adapt to five key aspects of the learning context: indicators of struggle, mastery patterns, topic progression history, session boundaries, and learning progression signals. Our demonstration will show how ExaCraft's examples evolve from basic concepts to advanced technical implementations, responding to topic repetition, regeneration requests, and topic progression patterns in different use cases.

An "Embodied Information Hub" is proposed as a new way to share knowledge through physical and conversational interaction. The prototype, Suzume-chan, is a small, soft AI agent running locally with a language model and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). It learns from spoken explanations and responds through dialogue, reducing psychological distance and making knowledge sharing warmer and more human-centered.

Abstract: Fact-checking health-related claims has become increasingly critical as misinformation proliferates online. Effective verification requires both the retrieval of high-quality evidence and rigorous reasoning processes. In this paper, we propose a two-stage framework for health misinformation detection: Agreement Score Prediction followed by Multi-Agent Debate. In the first stage, we employ large language models (LLMs) to independently evaluate retrieved articles and compute an aggregated agreement score that reflects the overall evidence stance. When this score indicates insufficient consensus-falling below a predefined threshold-the system proceeds to a second stage. Multiple agents engage in structured debate to synthesize conflicting evidence and generate well-reasoned verdicts with explicit justifications. Experimental results demonstrate that our two-stage approach achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods, highlighting the value of combining automated scoring with collaborative reasoning for complex verification tasks.

Abstract: Echocardiography is central to contemporary cardiovascular care, but full-study interpretation remains a cognitively demanding, multi-view task that is still performed manually. While recent foundation models for echocardiography can achieve strong performance on individual perceptual subtasks such as view classification, segmentation, or disease prediction, they typically operate in isolation and do not provide a unified, clinically coherent assessment. In this work, we introduce Echo-CoPilot, a multi-view, multi-task agent that uses a large language model to orchestrate a suite of specialized echocardiography tools. Within a ReAct-style loop, the agent decomposes clinician queries, invokes tools for view recognition, cardiac structure segmentation, measurement and disease prediction, and report synthesis, and integrates their outputs into guideline-aware answers and narrative summaries. We evaluate Echo-CoPilot on the public MIMIC-EchoQA benchmark, where it achieves an accuracy of 50.8\%, outperforming both general-purpose and biomedical video vision-language models. Qualitative analyses further show that the agent leverages quantitative measurements and physiologic context to resolve challenging cases near clinical decision thresholds, such as borderline left ventricular hypertrophy or pericardial effusion severity. The code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly touted as powerful tools for automating scientific information extraction. However, existing methods and tools often struggle with the realities of scientific literature: long-context documents, multi-modal content, and reconciling varied and inconsistent fine-grained information across multiple publications into standardized formats. These challenges are further compounded when the desired data schema or extraction ontology changes rapidly, making it difficult to re-architect or fine-tune existing systems. We present SciEx, a modular and composable framework that decouples key components including PDF parsing, multi-modal retrieval, extraction, and aggregation. This design streamlines on-demand data extraction while enabling extensibility and flexible integration of new models, prompting strategies, and reasoning mechanisms. We evaluate SciEx on datasets spanning three scientific topics for its ability to extract fine-grained information accurately and consistently. Our findings provide practical insights into both the strengths and limitations of current LLM-based pipelines.

Abstract: This paper presents the Unified Smart Factory Model (USFM), a comprehensive framework designed to translate high-level sustainability goals into measurable factory-level indicators with a systematic information map of manufacturing activities. The manufacturing activities were modelled as set of manufacturing, assembly and auxiliary processes using Object Process Methodology, a Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) language. USFM integrates Manufacturing Process and System, Data Process, and Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Selection and Assessment in a single framework. Through a detailed case study of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) assembly factory, the paper demonstrates how environmental sustainability KPIs can be selected, modelled, and mapped to the necessary data, highlighting energy consumption and environmental impact metrics. The model's systematic approach can reduce redundancy, minimize the risk of missing critical information, and enhance data collection. The paper concluded that the USFM bridges the gap between sustainability goals and practical implementation, providing significant benefits for industries specifically SMEs aiming to achieve sustainability targets.

Abstract: Force field-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are indispensable for probing the structure, dynamics, and functions of biomolecular systems, including proteins and protein-ligand complexes. Despite their broad utility in drug discovery and protein engineering, the technical complexity of MD setup, encompassing parameterization, input preparation, and software configuration, remains a major barrier for widespread and efficient usage. Agentic LLMs have demonstrated their capacity to autonomously execute multi-step scientific processes, and to date, they have not successfully been used to automate protein-ligand MD workflows. Here, we present DynaMate, a modular multi-agent framework that autonomously designs and executes complete MD workflows for both protein and protein-ligand systems, and offers free energy binding affinity calculations with the MM/PB(GB)SA method. The framework integrates dynamic tool use, web search, PaperQA, and a self-correcting behavior. DynaMate comprises three specialized modules, interacting to plan the experiment, perform the simulation, and analyze the results. We evaluated its performance across twelve benchmark systems of varying complexity, assessing success rate, efficiency, and adaptability. DynaMate reliably performed full MD simulations, corrected runtime errors through iterative reasoning, and produced meaningful analyses of protein-ligand interactions. This automated framework paves the way toward standardized, scalable, and time-efficient molecular modeling pipelines for future biomolecular and drug design applications.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems increasingly assume consequential decision-making roles, a widening gap has emerged between technical capabilities and institutional accountability. Ethical guidance alone is insufficient to counter this challenge; it demands architectures that embed governance into the execution fabric of the ecosystem. This paper presents the Ten Criteria for Trustworthy Orchestration AI, a comprehensive assurance framework that integrates human input, semantic coherence, audit and provenance integrity into a unified Control-Panel architecture. Unlike conventional agentic AI initiatives that primarily focus on AI-to-AI coordination, the proposed framework provides an umbrella of governance to the entire AI components, their consumers and human participants. By taking aspiration from international standards and Australia's National Framework for AI Assurance initiative, this work demonstrates that trustworthiness can be systematically incorporated (by engineering) into AI systems, ensuring the execution fabric remains verifiable, transparent, reproducible and under meaningful human control.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have shown promising results in developing generalist robotics that can perform diverse tasks in open-ended scenarios given multimodal inputs. However, current work has been mainly focused on indoor, household scenarios. In this work, we present SimWorld-Robotics~(SWR), a simulation platform for embodied AI in large-scale, photorealistic urban environments. Built on Unreal Engine 5, SWR procedurally generates unlimited photorealistic urban scenes populated with dynamic elements such as pedestrians and traffic systems, surpassing prior urban simulations in realism, complexity, and scalability. It also supports multi-robot control and communication. With these key features, we build two challenging robot benchmarks: (1) a multimodal instruction-following task, where a robot must follow vision-language navigation instructions to reach a destination in the presence of pedestrians and traffic; and (2) a multi-agent search task, where two robots must communicate to cooperatively locate and meet each other. Unlike existing benchmarks, these two new benchmarks comprehensively evaluate a wide range of critical robot capacities in realistic scenarios, including (1) multimodal instructions grounding, (2) 3D spatial reasoning in large environments, (3) safe, long-range navigation with people and traffic, (4) multi-robot collaboration, and (5) grounded communication. Our experimental results demonstrate that state-of-the-art models, including vision-language models (VLMs), struggle with our tasks, lacking robust perception, reasoning, and planning abilities necessary for urban environments.

Abstract: Efficiency in optimisation and search processes persists to be one of the challenges, which affects the performance and use of optimisation algorithms. Utilising a pool of operators instead of a single operator to handle move operations within a neighbourhood remains promising, but an optimum or near optimum sequence of operators necessitates further investigation. One of the promising ideas is to generalise experiences and seek how to utilise it. Although numerous works are done around this issue for single objective optimisation, multi-objective cases have not much been touched in this regard. A generalised approach based on multi-objective reinforcement learning approach seems to create remedy for this issue and offer good solutions. This paper overviews a generalisation approach proposed with certain stages completed and phases outstanding that is aimed to help demonstrate the efficiency of using multi-objective reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) is inherently sequential, creating a latency bottleneck that scales linearly with output length. While ``Decomposition-and-Fill'' methods like Skeleton-of-Thought attempt to parallelize generation via external orchestration, they suffer from \textit{coherence drift} due to the lack of cross-stream communication. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Parallel Decoder Transformer (PDT)}, a parameter-efficient architecture that embeds coordination primitives directly into the inference process of a frozen pre-trained model.
  Instead of retraining the base model, PDT injects lightweight \textit{Speculative Note Conditioning (SNC)} adapters that allow parallel decoding streams to synchronize via a shared, dynamic latent space. We formulate coordination as a \textit{speculative consensus} problem, where sibling streams broadcast semantic ``notes'' to a global bus, gated by a learned verification head. We validate our approach on a 50,000-step curriculum using a frozen 20B-parameter backbone. Our results demonstrate that PDT achieves effective self-correction, reaching \textbf{77.8\% precision} in coverage prediction and recovering approximate serial semantics without modifying the trunk weights. This establishes PDT as a scalable, efficient alternative to full model fine-tuning for structured parallel generation.

Abstract: While much research in artificial intelligence (AI) has focused on scaling capabilities, the accelerating pace of development makes countervailing work on producing harmless, "aligned" systems increasingly urgent. Yet research on alignment has diverged along two largely parallel tracks: safety--centered on scaled intelligence, deceptive or scheming behaviors, and existential risk--and ethics--focused on present harms, the reproduction of social bias, and flaws in production pipelines. Although both communities warn of insufficient investment in alignment, they disagree on what alignment means or ought to mean. As a result, their efforts have evolved in relative isolation, shaped by distinct methodologies, institutional homes, and disciplinary genealogies.
  We present a large-scale, quantitative study showing the structural split between AI safety and AI ethics. Using a bibliometric and co-authorship network analysis of 6,442 papers from twelve major ML and NLP conferences (2020-2025), we find that over 80% of collaborations occur within either the safety or ethics communities, and cross-field connectivity is highly concentrated: roughly 5% of papers account for more than 85% of bridging links. Removing a small number of these brokers sharply increases segregation, indicating that cross-disciplinary exchange depends on a handful of actors rather than broad, distributed collaboration. These results show that the safety-ethics divide is not only conceptual but institutional, with implications for research agendas, policy, and venues. We argue that integrating technical safety work with normative ethics--via shared benchmarks, cross-institutional venues, and mixed-method methodologies--is essential for building AI systems that are both robust and just.

Abstract: Data center (DC) infrastructure serves as the backbone to support the escalating demand for computing capacity. Traditional design methodologies that blend human expertise with specialized simulation tools scale poorly with the increasing system complexity. Recent studies adopt generative artificial intelligence to design plausible human-centric indoor layouts. However, they do not consider the underlying physics, making them unsuitable for the DC design that sets quantifiable operational objectives and strict physical constraints. To bridge the gap, we propose Phythesis, a novel framework that synergizes large language models (LLMs) and physics-guided evolutionary optimization to automate simulation-ready (SimReady) scene synthesis for energy-efficient DC design. Phythesis employs an iterative bi-level optimization architecture, where (i) the LLM-driven optimization level generates physically plausible three-dimensional layouts and self-criticizes them to refine the scene topology, and (ii) the physics-informed optimization level identifies the optimal asset parameters and selects the best asset combination. Experiments on three generation scales show that Phythesis achieves 57.3% generation success rate increase and 11.5% power usage effectiveness (PUE) improvement, compared with the vanilla LLM-based solution.

Abstract: We investigate how LLMs encode sociodemographic attributes of human conversational partners inferred from indirect cues such as names and occupations. We show that LLMs develop linear representations of user demographics within activation space, wherein stereotypically associated attributes are encoded along interpretable geometric directions. We first probe residual streams across layers of four open transformer-based LLMs (Magistral 24B, Qwen3 14B, GPT-OSS 20B, OLMo2-1B) prompted with explicit demographic disclosure. We show that the same probes predict demographics from implicit cues: names activate census-aligned gender and race representations, while occupations trigger representations correlated with real-world workforce statistics. These linear representations allow us to explain demographic inferences implicitly formed by LLMs during conversation. We demonstrate that these implicit demographic representations actively shape downstream behavior, such as career recommendations. Our study further highlights that models that pass bias benchmark tests may still harbor and leverage implicit biases, with implications for fairness when applied at scale.

Abstract: Analyzing large-scale text corpora is a core challenge in machine learning, crucial for tasks like identifying undesirable model behaviors or biases in training data. Current methods often rely on costly LLM-based techniques (e.g. annotating dataset differences) or dense embedding models (e.g. for clustering), which lack control over the properties of interest. We propose using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to create SAE embeddings: representations whose dimensions map to interpretable concepts. Through four data analysis tasks, we show that SAE embeddings are more cost-effective and reliable than LLMs and more controllable than dense embeddings. Using the large hypothesis space of SAEs, we can uncover insights such as (1) semantic differences between datasets and (2) unexpected concept correlations in documents. For instance, by comparing model responses, we find that Grok-4 clarifies ambiguities more often than nine other frontier models. Relative to LLMs, SAE embeddings uncover bigger differences at 2-8x lower cost and identify biases more reliably. Additionally, SAE embeddings are controllable: by filtering concepts, we can (3) cluster documents along axes of interest and (4) outperform dense embeddings on property-based retrieval. Using SAE embeddings, we study model behavior with two case studies: investigating how OpenAI model behavior has changed over time and finding "trigger" phrases learned by Tulu-3 (Lambert et al., 2024) from its training data. These results position SAEs as a versatile tool for unstructured data analysis and highlight the neglected importance of interpreting models through their data.

Abstract: Conspiratorial discourse is increasingly embedded within digital communication ecosystems, yet its structure and spread remain difficult to study. This work analyzes conspiratorial narratives in Singapore-based Telegram groups, showing that such content is woven into everyday discussions rather than confined to isolated echo chambers. We propose a two-stage computational framework. First, we fine-tune RoBERTa-large to classify messages as conspiratorial or not, achieving an F1-score of 0.866 on 2,000 expert-labeled messages. Second, we build a signed belief graph in which nodes represent messages and edge signs reflect alignment in belief labels, weighted by textual similarity. We introduce a Signed Belief Graph Neural Network (SiBeGNN) that uses a Sign Disentanglement Loss to learn embeddings that separate ideological alignment from stylistic features.
  Using hierarchical clustering on these embeddings, we identify seven narrative archetypes across 553,648 messages: legal topics, medical concerns, media discussions, finance, contradictions in authority, group moderation, and general chat. SiBeGNN yields stronger clustering quality (cDBI = 8.38) than baseline methods (13.60 to 67.27), supported by 88 percent inter-rater agreement in expert evaluations. Our analysis shows that conspiratorial messages appear not only in clusters focused on skepticism or distrust, but also within routine discussions of finance, law, and everyday matters. These findings challenge common assumptions about online radicalization by demonstrating that conspiratorial discourse operates within ordinary social interaction. The proposed framework advances computational methods for belief-driven discourse analysis and offers applications for stance detection, political communication studies, and content moderation policy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in democratizing access to information. However, in the domain of agriculture, general-purpose models frequently suffer from contextual hallucination, which provides non-factual advice or answers are scientifically sound in one region but disastrous in another due to variations in soil, climate, and local regulations. We introduce AgriRegion, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed specifically for high-fidelity, region-aware agricultural advisory. Unlike standard RAG approaches that rely solely on semantic similarity, AgriRegion incorporates a geospatial metadata injection layer and a region-prioritized re-ranking mechanism. By restricting the knowledge base to verified local agricultural extension services and enforcing geo-spatial constraints during retrieval, AgriRegion ensures that the advice regarding planting schedules, pest control, and fertilization is locally accurate. We create a novel benchmark dataset, AgriRegion-Eval, which comprises 160 domain-specific questions across 12 agricultural subfields. Experiments demonstrate that AgriRegion reduces hallucinations by 10-20% compared to state-of-the-art LLMs systems and significantly improves trust scores according to a comprehensive evaluation.

Abstract: Foundation model developers are among the world's most important companies. As these companies become increasingly consequential, how do their transparency practices evolve? The 2025 Foundation Model Transparency Index is the third edition of an annual effort to characterize and quantify the transparency of foundation model developers. The 2025 FMTI introduces new indicators related to data acquisition, usage data, and monitoring and evaluates companies like Alibaba, DeepSeek, and xAI for the first time. The 2024 FMTI reported that transparency was improving, but the 2025 FMTI finds this progress has deteriorated: the average score out of 100 fell from 58 in 2024 to 40 in 2025. Companies are most opaque about their training data and training compute as well as the post-deployment usage and impact of their flagship models. In spite of this general trend, IBM stands out as a positive outlier, scoring 95, in contrast to the lowest scorers, xAI and Midjourney, at just 14. The five members of the Frontier Model Forum we score end up in the middle of the Index: we posit that these companies avoid reputational harms from low scores but lack incentives to be transparency leaders. As policymakers around the world increasingly mandate certain types of transparency, this work reveals the current state of transparency for foundation model developers, how it may change given newly enacted policy, and where more aggressive policy interventions are necessary to address critical information deficits.

Abstract: Medical care follows complex clinical pathways that extend beyond isolated physician-patient encounters, emphasizing decision-making and transitions between different stages. Current benchmarks focusing on static exams or isolated dialogues inadequately evaluate large language models (LLMs) in dynamic clinical scenarios. We introduce CP-Env, a controllable agentic hospital environment designed to evaluate LLMs across end-to-end clinical pathways. CP-Env simulates a hospital ecosystem with patient and physician agents, constructing scenarios ranging from triage and specialist consultation to diagnostic testing and multidisciplinary team meetings for agent interaction. Following real hospital adaptive flow of healthcare, it enables branching, long-horizon task execution. We propose a three-tiered evaluation framework encompassing Clinical Efficacy, Process Competency, and Professional Ethics. Results reveal that most models struggle with pathway complexity, exhibiting hallucinations and losing critical diagnostic details. Interestingly, excessive reasoning steps can sometimes prove counterproductive, while top models tend to exhibit reduced tool dependency through internalized knowledge. CP-Env advances medical AI agents development through comprehensive end-to-end clinical evaluation. We provide the benchmark and evaluation tools for further research and development at https://github.com/SPIRAL-MED/CP-Env.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MIPs) are powerful and flexible tools for modeling a wide range of real-world combinatorial optimization problems. Predict-and-Search methods operate by using a predictive model to estimate promising variable assignments and then guiding a search procedure toward high-quality solutions. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating machine learning (ML) into the Predict-and-Search framework significantly enhances its performance. Still, it is restricted to binary problems and overlooks the presence of fixed variables that commonly arise in practical settings. This work extends the Predict-and-Search (PaS) framework to parametric MIPs and introduces ID-PaS, an identity-aware learning framework that enables the ML model to handle heterogeneous variables more effectively. Experiments on several real-world large-scale problems demonstrate that ID-PaS consistently achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art solver Gurobi and PaS.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various reasoning tasks, yet they often struggle with problems involving missing information, exhibiting issues such as incomplete responses, factual errors, and hallucinations. While forward reasoning approaches like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) have shown success in structured problem-solving, they frequently fail to systematically identify and recover omitted information. In this paper, we explore the potential of reverse thinking methodologies to enhance LLMs' performance on missing information detection tasks. Drawing inspiration from recent work on backward reasoning, we propose a novel framework that guides LLMs through reverse thinking to identify necessary conditions and pinpoint missing elements. Our approach transforms the challenging task of missing information identification into a more manageable backward reasoning problem, significantly improving model accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our reverse thinking approach achieves substantial performance gains compared to traditional forward reasoning methods, providing a promising direction for enhancing LLMs' logical completeness and reasoning robustness.

Abstract: Attention improves representation learning over RNNs, but its discrete nature limits continuous-time (CT) modeling. We introduce Neuronal Attention Circuit (NAC), a novel, biologically plausible CT-Attention mechanism that reformulates attention logits computation as the solution to a linear first-order ODE with nonlinear interlinked gates derived from repurposing \textit{C. elegans} Neuronal Circuit Policies (NCPs) wiring mechanism. NAC replaces dense projections with sparse sensory gates for key-query projections and a sparse backbone network with two heads for computing \textit{content-target} and \textit{learnable time-constant} gates, enabling efficient adaptive dynamics. NAC supports three attention logit computation modes: (i) explicit Euler integration, (ii) exact closed-form solution, and (iii) steady-state approximation. To improve memory intensity, we implemented a sparse Top-\emph{K} pairwise concatenation scheme that selectively curates key-query interactions. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, including state stability, bounded approximation errors, and universal approximation. Empirically, we implemented NAC in diverse domains, including irregular time-series classification, lane-keeping for autonomous vehicles, and industrial prognostics. We observed that NAC matches or outperforms competing baselines in accuracy and occupies an intermediate position in runtime and memory efficiency compared with several CT baselines.

Abstract: Despite excelling on multimodal benchmarks, vision-language models (VLMs) largely remain a black box. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretability framework to systematically analyze the internal mechanisms of VLMs, focusing on the functional roles of attention heads in multimodal reasoning. To this end, we introduce CogVision, a dataset that decomposes complex multimodal questions into step-by-step subquestions designed to simulate human reasoning through a chain-of-thought paradigm, with each subquestion associated with specific receptive or cognitive functions such as high-level visual reception and inference. Using a probing-based methodology, we identify attention heads that specialize in these functions and characterize them as functional heads. Our analysis across diverse VLM families reveals that these functional heads are universally sparse, vary in number and distribution across functions, and mediate interactions and hierarchical organization. Furthermore, intervention experiments demonstrate their critical role in multimodal reasoning: removing functional heads leads to performance degradation, while emphasizing them enhances accuracy. These findings provide new insights into the cognitive organization of VLMs and suggest promising directions for designing models with more human-aligned perceptual and reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Precise environmental perception is critical for the reliability of autonomous driving systems. While collaborative perception mitigates the limitations of single-agent perception through information sharing, it encounters a fundamental communication-performance trade-off. Existing communication-efficient approaches typically assume MB-level data transmission per collaboration, which may fail due to practical network constraints. To address these issues, we propose InfoCom, an information-aware framework establishing the pioneering theoretical foundation for communication-efficient collaborative perception via extended Information Bottleneck principles. Departing from mainstream feature manipulation, InfoCom introduces a novel information purification paradigm that theoretically optimizes the extraction of minimal sufficient task-critical information under Information Bottleneck constraints. Its core innovations include: i) An Information-Aware Encoding condensing features into minimal messages while preserving perception-relevant information; ii) A Sparse Mask Generation identifying spatial cues with negligible communication cost; and iii) A Multi-Scale Decoding that progressively recovers perceptual information through mask-guided mechanisms rather than simple feature reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that InfoCom achieves near-lossless perception while reducing communication overhead from megabyte to kilobyte-scale, representing 440-fold and 90-fold reductions per agent compared to Where2comm and ERMVP, respectively.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to navigate complex environments by following natural-language instructions. General Scene Adaptation for VLN (GSA-VLN) shifts the focus from zero-shot generalization to continual, environment-specific adaptation, narrowing the gap between static benchmarks and real-world deployment. However, current GSA-VLN frameworks exclude user feedback, relying solely on unsupervised adaptation from repeated environmental exposure. In practice, user feedback offers natural and valuable supervision that can significantly enhance adaptation quality. We introduce a user-feedback-driven adaptation framework that extends GSA-VLN by systematically integrating human interactions into continual learning. Our approach converts user feedback-navigation instructions and corrective signals-into high-quality, environment-aligned training data, enabling efficient and realistic adaptation. A memory-bank warm-start mechanism further reuses previously acquired environmental knowledge, mitigating cold-start degradation and ensuring stable redeployment. Experiments on the GSA-R2R benchmark show that our method consistently surpasses strong baselines such as GR-DUET, improving navigation success and path efficiency. The memory-bank warm start stabilizes early navigation and reduces performance drops after updates. Results under both continual and hybrid adaptation settings confirm the robustness and generality of our framework, demonstrating sustained improvement across diverse deployment conditions.

Abstract: Inference-time steering enables pretrained diffusion/flow models to be adapted to new tasks without retraining. A widely used approach is the ratio-of-densities method, which defines a time-indexed target path by reweighting probability-density trajectories from multiple models with positive, or in some cases, negative exponents. This construction, however, harbors a critical and previously unformalized failure mode: Marginal Path Collapse, where intermediate densities become non-normalizable even though endpoints remain valid. Collapse arises systematically when composing heterogeneous models trained on different noise schedules or datasets, including a common setting in molecular design where de-novo, conformer, and pocket-conditioned models must be combined for tasks such as flexible-pose scaffold decoration. We provide a novel and complete solution for the problem. First, we derive a simple path existence criterion that predicts exactly when collapse occurs from noise schedules and exponents alone. Second, we introduce Adaptive path Correction with Exponents (ACE), which extends Feynman-Kac steering to time-varying exponents and guarantees a valid probability path. On a synthetic 2D benchmark and on flexible-pose scaffold decoration, ACE eliminates collapse and enables high-guidance compositional generation, improving distributional and docking metrics over constant-exponent baselines and even specialized task-specific scaffold decoration models. Our work turns ratio-of-densities steering with heterogeneous experts from an unstable heuristic into a reliable tool for controllable generation.

Abstract: Data-protection regulations such as the GDPR grant every participant in a federated system a right to be forgotten. Federated unlearning has therefore emerged as a research frontier, aiming to remove a specific party's contribution from the learned model while preserving the utility of the remaining parties. However, most unlearning techniques focus on Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL), where data are partitioned by samples. In contrast, Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) allows organizations that possess complementary feature spaces to train a joint model without sharing raw data. The resulting feature-partitioned architecture renders HFL-oriented unlearning methods ineffective. In this paper, we propose REMISVFU, a plug-and-play representation misdirection framework that enables fast, client-level unlearning in splitVFL systems. When a deletion request arrives, the forgetting party collapses its encoder output to a randomly sampled anchor on the unit sphere, severing the statistical link between its features and the global model. To maintain utility for the remaining parties, the server jointly optimizes a retention loss and a forgetting loss, aligning their gradients via orthogonal projection to eliminate destructive interference. Evaluations on public benchmarks show that REMISVFU suppresses back-door attack success to the natural class-prior level and sacrifices only about 2.5% points of clean accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the challenge of recommending emerging items, whose interactions gradually accumulate over time. Existing methods often overlook this dynamic process, typically assuming that emerging items have few or even no historical interactions. Such an assumption oversimplifies the problem, as a good model must preserve the uniqueness of emerging items while leveraging their shared patterns with established ones. To address this challenge, we propose EmerFlow, a novel LLM-empowered representation learning framework that generates distinctive embeddings for emerging items. It first enriches the raw features of emerging items through LLM reasoning, then aligns these representations with the embedding space of the existing recommendation model. Finally, new interactions are incorporated through meta-learning to refine the embeddings. This enables EmerFlow to learn expressive embeddings for emerging items from only limited interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse domains, including movies and pharmaceuticals, show that EmerFlow consistently outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: The rapid development of mobile GUI agents has stimulated growing research interest in long-horizon task automation. However, building agents for these tasks faces a critical bottleneck: the reliance on ever-expanding interaction history incurs substantial context overhead. Existing context management and compression techniques often fail to preserve vital semantic information, leading to degraded task performance. We propose AgentProg, a program-guided approach for agent context management that reframes the interaction history as a program with variables and control flow. By organizing information according to the structure of program, this structure provides a principled mechanism to determine which information should be retained and which can be discarded. We further integrate a global belief state mechanism inspired by Belief MDP framework to handle partial observability and adapt to unexpected environmental changes. Experiments on AndroidWorld and our extended long-horizon task suite demonstrate that AgentProg has achieved the state-of-the-art success rates on these benchmarks. More importantly, it maintains robust performance on long-horizon tasks while baseline methods experience catastrophic degradation. Our system is open-sourced at https://github.com/MobileLLM/AgentProg.

Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has become a common choice in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Considering existing RL-based finetuning methods, entropy intervention turns out to be an effective way to benefit exploratory ability, thereby improving policy performance. Notably, most existing studies intervene in entropy by simply controlling the update of specific tokens during policy optimization of RL. They ignore the entropy intervention during the RL sampling that can boost the performance of GRPO by improving the diversity of responses. In this paper, we propose Selective-adversarial Entropy Intervention, namely SaEI, which enhances policy entropy by distorting the visual input with the token-selective adversarial objective coming from the entropy of sampled responses. Specifically, we first propose entropy-guided adversarial sampling (EgAS) that formulates the entropy of sampled responses as an adversarial objective. Then, the corresponding adversarial gradient can be used to attack the visual input for producing adversarial samples, allowing the policy model to explore a larger answer space during RL sampling. Then, we propose token-selective entropy computation (TsEC) to maximize the effectiveness of adversarial attack in EgAS without distorting factual knowledge within VLMs. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets show that our proposed method can greatly improve policy exploration via entropy intervention, to boost reasoning capabilities. Code will be released once the paper is accepted.

Abstract: The representation of graphs is commonly based on the adjacency matrix concept. This formulation is the foundation of most algebraic and computational approaches to graph processing. The advent of deep learning language models offers a wide range of powerful computational models that are specialized in the processing of text. However, current procedures to represent graphs are not amenable to processing by these models. In this work, a new method to represent graphs is proposed. It represents the adjacency matrix of a graph by a string of simple instructions. The instructions build the adjacency matrix step by step. The transformation is reversible, i.e. given a graph the string can be produced and vice versa. The proposed representation is compact and it maintains the local structural patterns of the graph. Therefore, it is envisaged that it could be useful to boost the processing of graphs by deep learning models. A tentative computational experiment is reported, with favorable results.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous systems requires controllers that satisfy hard, state-wise constraints without relying on online interaction. While existing Safe Offline RL methods typically enforce soft expected-cost constraints, they do not guarantee forward invariance. Conversely, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide rigorous safety guarantees but usually depend on expert-designed barrier functions or full knowledge of the system dynamics. We introduce Value-Guided Offline Control Barrier Functions (V-OCBF), a framework that learns a neural CBF entirely from offline demonstrations. Unlike prior approaches, V-OCBF does not assume access to the dynamics model; instead, it derives a recursive finite-difference barrier update, enabling model-free learning of a barrier that propagates safety information over time. Moreover, V-OCBF incorporates an expectile-based objective that avoids querying the barrier on out-of-distribution actions and restricts updates to the dataset-supported action set. The learned barrier is then used with a Quadratic Program (QP) formulation to synthesize real-time safe control. Across multiple case studies, V-OCBF yields substantially fewer safety violations than baseline methods while maintaining strong task performance, highlighting its scalability for offline synthesis of safety-critical controllers without online interaction or hand-engineered barriers.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have made fine-tuning text-to-image models for personalization increasingly accessible, but have also raised significant concerns regarding unauthorized data usage and privacy infringement. Current protection methods are limited to passively degrading image quality, failing to achieve stable control. While Targeted Data Protection (TDP) offers a promising paradigm for active redirection toward user-specified target concepts, existing TDP attempts suffer from poor controllability due to snapshot-matching approaches that fail to account for complete learning dynamics. We introduce TAFAP (Trajectory Alignment via Fine-tuning with Adversarial Perturbations), the first method to successfully achieve effective TDP by controlling the entire training trajectory. Unlike snapshot-based methods whose protective influence is easily diluted as training progresses, TAFAP employs trajectory-matching inspired by dataset distillation to enforce persistent, verifiable transformations throughout fine-tuning. We validate our method through extensive experiments, demonstrating the first successful targeted transformation in diffusion models with simultaneous control over both identity and visual patterns. TAFAP significantly outperforms existing TDP attempts, achieving robust redirection toward target concepts while maintaining high image quality. This work enables verifiable safeguards and provides a new framework for controlling and tracing alterations in diffusion model outputs.

Abstract: The landscape of scientific peer review is rapidly evolving with the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs). This shift is driven by two parallel trends: the widespread individual adoption of LLMs by reviewers to manage workload (the "Lazy Reviewer" hypothesis) and the formal institutional deployment of AI-powered assessment systems by conferences like AAAI and Stanford's Agents4Science. This study investigates the robustness of these "LLM-as-a-Judge" systems (both illicit and sanctioned) to adversarial PDF manipulation. Unlike general jailbreaks, we focus on a distinct incentive: flipping "Reject" decisions to "Accept," for which we develop a novel evaluation metric which we term as WAVS (Weighted Adversarial Vulnerability Score). We curated a dataset of 200 scientific papers and adapted 15 domain-specific attack strategies to this task, evaluating them across 13 Language Models, including GPT-5, Claude Haiku, and DeepSeek. Our results demonstrate that obfuscation strategies like "Maximum Mark Magyk" successfully manipulate scores, achieving alarming decision flip rates even in large-scale models. We will release our complete dataset and injection framework to facilitate more research on this topic.

Abstract: Urban regeneration presents significant challenges within the context of urbanization, requiring adaptive approaches to tackle evolving needs. Leveraging advancements in large language models (LLMs), we propose Cyclical Urban Planning (CUP), a new paradigm that continuously generates, evaluates, and refines urban plans in a closed-loop. Specifically, our multi-agent LLM-based framework consists of three key components: (1) Planning, where LLM agents generate and refine urban plans based on contextual data; (2) Living, where agents simulate the behaviors and interactions of residents, modeling life in the urban environment; and (3) Judging, which involves evaluating plan effectiveness and providing iterative feedback for improvement. The cyclical process enables a dynamic and responsive planning approach. Experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework as a continuous and adaptive planning process.

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation (PCG) offers scalable methods for algorithmically creating complex, customizable worlds. However, controlling these pipelines requires the precise configuration of opaque technical parameters. We propose a training-free architecture that utilizes LLM agents for zero-shot PCG parameter configuration. While Large Language Models (LLMs) promise a natural language interface for PCG tools, off-the-shelf models often fail to bridge the semantic gap between abstract user instructions and strict parameter specifications. Our system pairs an Actor agent with a Critic agent, enabling an iterative workflow where the system autonomously reasons over tool parameters and refines configurations to progressively align with human design preferences. We validate this approach on the generation of various 3D maps, establishing a new benchmark for instruction-following in PCG. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms single-agent baselines, producing diverse and structurally valid environments from natural language descriptions. These results demonstrate that off-the-shelf LLMs can be effectively repurposed as generalized agents for arbitrary PCG tools. By shifting the burden from model training to architectural reasoning, our method offers a scalable framework for mastering complex software without task-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents exhibit strong mathematical problem-solving abilities and can even solve International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) level problems with the assistance of formal proof systems. However, due to weak heuristics for auxiliary constructions, AI for geometry problem solving remains dominated by expert models such as AlphaGeometry 2, which rely heavily on large-scale data synthesis and search for both training and evaluation. In this work, we make the first attempt to build a medalist-level LLM agent for geometry and present InternGeometry. InternGeometry overcomes the heuristic limitations in geometry by iteratively proposing propositions and auxiliary constructions, verifying them with a symbolic engine, and reflecting on the engine's feedback to guide subsequent proposals. A dynamic memory mechanism enables InternGeometry to conduct more than two hundred interactions with the symbolic engine per problem. To further accelerate learning, we introduce Complexity-Boosting Reinforcement Learning (CBRL), which gradually increases the complexity of synthesized problems across training stages. Built on InternThinker-32B, InternGeometry solves 44 of 50 IMO geometry problems (2000-2024), exceeding the average gold medalist score (40.9), using only 13K training examples, just 0.004% of the data used by AlphaGeometry 2, demonstrating the potential of LLM agents on expert-level geometry tasks. InternGeometry can also propose novel auxiliary constructions for IMO problems that do not appear in human solutions. We will release the model, data, and symbolic engine to support future research.

Abstract: Multistep workflows that chain large language model (LLM) calls suffer from context pollution: as information accumulates across steps, models hallucinate, confuse intermediate outputs, and lose track of task constraints. We present NormCode, a semiformal language for constructing plans of inferences, structured decompositions where each step operates in data isolation and receives only explicitly passed inputs, which eliminates crossstep contamination by design. NormCode enforces a strict separation between semantic operations (LLMdriven reasoning, nondeterministic) and syntactic operations (deterministic data restructuring), enabling precise cost and reliability tracing. The language exists in three isomorphic formats: .ncds for human authoring, .ncd for machine execution, and .ncn for human verification, supporting progressive formalization from sketch to production. We validate NormCode through two demonstrations: (1) a base X addition algorithm achieving 100 percent accuracy on arbitrary length inputs, and (2) self hosted execution of NormCode's own five phase compiler pipeline. The working orchestrator provides dependency driven scheduling, SQLite backed checkpointing, and loop management, making AI workflows auditable by design and addressing a critical need for transparency in high stakes domains such as legal reasoning, medical decision making, and financial analysis.

Abstract: Unsupervised cell type identification is crucial for uncovering and characterizing heterogeneous populations in single cell omics studies. Although a range of clustering methods have been developed, most focus exclusively on intrinsic cellular structure and ignore the pivotal role of cell-gene associations, which limits their ability to distinguish closely related cell types. To this end, we propose a Refinement Contrastive Learning framework (scRCL) that explicitly incorporates cell-gene interactions to derive more informative representations. Specifically, we introduce two contrastive distribution alignment components that reveal reliable intrinsic cellular structures by effectively exploiting cell-cell structural relationships. Additionally, we develop a refinement module that integrates gene-correlation structure learning to enhance cell embeddings by capturing underlying cell-gene associations. This module strengthens connections between cells and their associated genes, refining the representation learning to exploiting biologically meaningful relationships. Extensive experiments on several single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cell-type identification accuracy. Moreover, downstream biological analyses confirm that the recovered cell populations exhibit coherent gene-expression signatures, further validating the biological relevance of our approach. The code is available at https://github.com/THPengL/scRCL.

Abstract: Diffusion models can unintentionally reproduce training examples, raising privacy and copyright concerns as these systems are increasingly deployed at scale. Existing inference-time mitigation methods typically manipulate classifier-free guidance (CFG) or perturb prompt embeddings; however, they often struggle to reduce memorization without compromising alignment with the conditioning prompt. We introduce CAPTAIN, a training-free framework that mitigates memorization by directly modifying latent features during denoising. CAPTAIN first applies frequency-based noise initialization to reduce the tendency to replicate memorized patterns early in the denoising process. It then identifies the optimal denoising timesteps for feature injection and localizes memorized regions. Finally, CAPTAIN injects semantically aligned features from non-memorized reference images into localized latent regions, suppressing memorization while preserving prompt fidelity and visual quality. Our experiments show that CAPTAIN achieves substantial reductions in memorization compared to CFG-based baselines while maintaining strong alignment with the intended prompt.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLM) based multi-agent systems become increasingly prevalent, the collective behaviors, e.g., collective intelligence, of such artificial communities have drawn growing attention. This work aims to answer a fundamental question: How does diversity of values shape the collective behavior of AI communities? Using naturalistic value elicitation grounded in the prevalent Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values, we constructed multi-agent simulations where communities with varying numbers of agents engaged in open-ended interactions and constitution formation. The results show that value diversity enhances value stability, fosters emergent behaviors, and brings more creative principles developed by the agents themselves without external guidance. However, these effects also show diminishing returns: extreme heterogeneity induces instability. This work positions value diversity as a new axis of future AI capability, bridging AI ability and sociological studies of institutional emergence.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Early-exit networks are effective solutions for reducing the overall energy consumption and latency of deep learning models by adjusting computation based on the complexity of input data. By incorporating intermediate exit branches into the architecture, they provide less computation for simpler samples, which is particularly beneficial for resource-constrained devices where energy consumption is crucial. However, designing early-exit networks is a challenging and time-consuming process due to the need to balance efficiency and performance. Recent works have utilized Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to design more efficient early-exit networks, aiming to reduce average latency while improving model accuracy by determining the best positions and number of exit branches in the architecture. Another important factor affecting the efficiency and accuracy of early-exit networks is the depth and types of layers in the exit branches. In this paper, we use hardware-aware NAS to strengthen exit branches, considering both accuracy and efficiency during optimization. Our performance evaluation on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets demonstrates that our proposed framework, which considers varying depths and layers for exit branches along with adaptive threshold tuning, designs early-exit networks that achieve higher accuracy with the same or lower average number of MACs compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Safety evaluations of large language models (LLMs) typically focus on universal risks like dangerous capabilities or undesirable propensities. However, millions use LLMs for personal advice on high-stakes topics like finance and health, where harms are context-dependent rather than universal. While frameworks like the OECD's AI classification recognize the need to assess individual risks, user-welfare safety evaluations remain underdeveloped. We argue that developing such evaluations is non-trivial due to fundamental questions about accounting for user context in evaluation design. In this exploratory study, we evaluated advice on finance and health from GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across user profiles of varying vulnerability. First, we demonstrate that evaluators must have access to rich user context: identical LLM responses were rated significantly safer by context-blind evaluators than by those aware of user circumstances, with safety scores for high-vulnerability users dropping from safe (5/7) to somewhat unsafe (3/7). One might assume this gap could be addressed by creating realistic user prompts containing key contextual information. However, our second study challenges this: we rerun the evaluation on prompts containing context users report they would disclose, finding no significant improvement. Our work establishes that effective user-welfare safety evaluation requires evaluators to assess responses against diverse user profiles, as realistic user context disclosure alone proves insufficient, particularly for vulnerable populations. By demonstrating a methodology for context-aware evaluation, this study provides both a starting point for such assessments and foundational evidence that evaluating individual welfare demands approaches distinct from existing universal-risk frameworks. We publish our code and dataset to aid future developments.

Abstract: Procedural memory enables large language model (LLM) agents to internalize "how-to" knowledge, theoretically reducing redundant trial-and-error. However, existing frameworks predominantly suffer from a "passive accumulation" paradigm, treating memory as a static append-only archive. To bridge the gap between static storage and dynamic reasoning, we propose $\textbf{ReMe}$ ($\textit{Remember Me, Refine Me}$), a comprehensive framework for experience-driven agent evolution. ReMe innovates across the memory lifecycle via three mechanisms: 1) $\textit{multi-faceted distillation}$, which extracts fine-grained experiences by recognizing success patterns, analyzing failure triggers and generating comparative insights; 2) $\textit{context-adaptive reuse}$, which tailors historical insights to new contexts via scenario-aware indexing; and 3) $\textit{utility-based refinement}$, which autonomously adds valid memories and prunes outdated ones to maintain a compact, high-quality experience pool. Extensive experiments on BFCL-V3 and AppWorld demonstrate that ReMe establishes a new state-of-the-art in agent memory system. Crucially, we observe a significant memory-scaling effect: Qwen3-8B equipped with ReMe outperforms larger, memoryless Qwen3-14B, suggesting that self-evolving memory provides a computation-efficient pathway for lifelong learning. We release our code and the $\texttt{reme.library}$ dataset to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved Chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation in multiple aspects. However, many medical VLMs rely solely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which optimizes next-token prediction without evaluating answer quality. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) can incorporate task-specific feedback, and its combination with explicit intermediate reasoning ("thinking") has demonstrated substantial gains on verifiable math and coding tasks. To investigate the effects of RL and thinking in a CXR VLM, we perform large-scale SFT on CXR data to build an updated RadVLM based on Qwen3-VL, followed by a cold-start SFT stage that equips the model with basic thinking ability. We then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with clinically grounded, task-specific rewards for report generation and visual grounding, and run matched RL experiments on both domain-specific and general-domain Qwen3-VL variants, with and without thinking. Across these settings, we find that while strong SFT remains crucial for high base performance, RL provides additional gains on both tasks, whereas explicit thinking does not appear to further improve results. Under a unified evaluation pipeline, the RL-optimized RadVLM models outperform their baseline counterparts and reach state-of-the-art performance on both report generation and grounding, highlighting clinically aligned RL as a powerful complement to SFT for medical VLMs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often fail on multi-hop queries when the initial retrieval misses a bridge fact. Prior corrective approaches, such as Self-RAG, CRAG, and Adaptive-$k$, typically address this by \textit{adding} more context or pruning existing lists. However, simply expanding the context window often leads to \textbf{context dilution}, where distractors crowd out relevant information. We propose \textbf{SEAL-RAG}, a training-free controller that adopts a \textbf{``replace, don't expand''} strategy to fight context dilution under a fixed retrieval depth $k$. SEAL executes a (\textbf{S}earch $\rightarrow$ \textbf{E}xtract $\rightarrow$ \textbf{A}ssess $\rightarrow$ \textbf{L}oop) cycle: it performs on-the-fly, entity-anchored extraction to build a live \textit{gap specification} (missing entities/relations), triggers targeted micro-queries, and uses \textit{entity-first ranking} to actively swap out distractors for gap-closing evidence. We evaluate SEAL-RAG against faithful re-implementations of Basic RAG, CRAG, Self-RAG, and Adaptive-$k$ in a shared environment on \textbf{HotpotQA} and \textbf{2WikiMultiHopQA}. On HotpotQA ($k=3$), SEAL improves answer correctness by \textbf{+3--13 pp} and evidence precision by \textbf{+12--18 pp} over Self-RAG. On 2WikiMultiHopQA ($k=5$), it outperforms Adaptive-$k$ by \textbf{+8.0 pp} in accuracy and maintains \textbf{96\%} evidence precision compared to 22\% for CRAG. These gains are statistically significant ($p<0.001$). By enforcing fixed-$k$ replacement, SEAL yields a predictable cost profile while ensuring the top-$k$ slots are optimized for precision rather than mere breadth. We release our code and data at https://github.com/mosherino/SEAL-RAG.

Abstract: Background: While intravascular imaging, particularly optical coherence tomography (OCT), improves percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) outcomes, its interpretation is operator-dependent. General-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) shows promise but lacks domain-specific reliability. We evaluated the performance of CA-GPT, a novel large model deployed on an AI-OCT system, against that of the general-purpose ChatGPT-5 and junior physicians for OCT-guided PCI planning and assessment.
  Methods: In this single-center analysis of 96 patients who underwent OCT-guided PCI, the procedural decisions generated by the CA-GPT, ChatGPT-5, and junior physicians were compared with an expert-derived procedural record. Agreement was assessed using ten pre-specified metrics across pre-PCI and post-PCI phases.
  Results: For pre-PCI planning, CA-GPT demonstrated significantly higher median agreement scores (5[IQR 3.75-5]) compared to both ChatGPT-5 (3[2-4], P<0.001) and junior physicians (4[3-4], P<0.001). CA-GPT significantly outperformed ChatGPT-5 across all individual pre-PCI metrics and showed superior performance to junior physicians in stent diameter (90.3% vs. 72.2%, P<0.05) and length selection (80.6% vs. 52.8%, P<0.01). In post-PCI assessment, CA-GPT maintained excellent overall agreement (5[4.75-5]), significantly higher than both ChatGPT-5 (4[4-5], P<0.001) and junior physicians (5[4-5], P<0.05). Subgroup analysis confirmed CA-GPT's robust performance advantage in complex scenarios.
  Conclusion: The CA-GPT-based AI-OCT system achieved superior decision-making agreement versus a general-purpose large language model and junior physicians across both PCI planning and assessment phases. This approach provides a standardized and reliable method for intravascular imaging interpretation, demonstrating significant potential to augment operator expertise and optimize OCT-guided PCI.

Abstract: Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) mines activity patterns from the time-series sensory data. In realistic scenarios, variations across individuals, devices, environments, and time introduce significant distributional shifts for the same activities. Recent efforts attempt to solve this challenge by applying or adapting existing out-of-distribution (OOD) algorithms, but only in certain distribution shift scenarios (e.g., cross-device or cross-position), lacking comprehensive insights on the effectiveness of these algorithms. For instance, is OOD necessary to HAR? Which OOD algorithm performs the best? In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing HAROOD, a comprehensive benchmark for HAR in OOD settings. We define 4 OOD scenarios: cross-person, cross-position, cross-dataset, and cross-time, and build a testbed covering 6 datasets, 16 comparative methods (implemented with CNN-based and Transformer-based architectures), and two model selection protocols. Then, we conduct extensive experiments and present several findings for future research, e.g., no single method consistently outperforms others, highlighting substantial opportunity for advancement. Our codebase is highly modular and easy to extend for new datasets, algorithms, comparisons, and analysis, with the hope to facilitate the research in OOD-based HAR. Our implementation is released and can be found at https://github.com/AIFrontierLab/HAROOD.

Abstract: From content moderation to content curation, applications requiring vision classifiers for visual concepts are rapidly expanding. Existing human-in-the-loop approaches typically assume users begin with a clear, stable concept understanding to be able to provide high-quality supervision. In reality, users often start with a vague idea and must iteratively refine it through "concept deliberation", a practice we uncovered through structured interviews with content moderation experts. We operationalize the common strategies in deliberation used by real content moderators into a human-in-the-loop framework called "Agile Deliberation" that explicitly supports evolving and subjective concepts. The system supports users in defining the concept for themselves by exposing them to borderline cases. The system does this with two deliberation stages: (1) concept scoping, which decomposes the initial concept into a structured hierarchy of sub-concepts, and (2) concept iteration, which surfaces semantically borderline examples for user reflection and feedback to iteratively align an image classifier with the user's evolving intent. Since concept deliberation is inherently subjective and interactive, we painstakingly evaluate the framework through 18 user sessions, each 1.5h long, rather than standard benchmarking datasets. We find that Agile Deliberation achieves 7.5% higher F1 scores than automated decomposition baselines and more than 3% higher than manual deliberation, while participants reported clearer conceptual understanding and lower cognitive effort.

Abstract: We explore how large language models (LLMs) can enhance the proposal selection process at large user facilities, offering a scalable, consistent, and cost-effective alternative to traditional human review. Proposal selection depends on assessing the relative strength among submitted proposals; however, traditional human scoring often suffers from weak inter-proposal correlations and is subject to reviewer bias and inconsistency. A pairwise preference-based approach is logically superior, providing a more rigorous and internally consistent basis for ranking, but its quadratic workload makes it impractical for human reviewers. We address this limitation using LLMs. Leveraging the uniquely well-curated proposals and publication records from three beamlines at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), we show that the LLM rankings correlate strongly with the human rankings (Spearman $ρ\simeq 0.2-0.8$, improving to $\geq 0.5$ after 10\% outlier removal). Moreover, LLM performance is no worse than that of human reviewers in identifying proposals with high publication potential, while costing over two orders of magnitude less. Beyond ranking, LLMs enable advanced analyses that are challenging for humans, such as quantitative assessment of proposal similarity via embedding models, which provides information crucial for review committees.

Abstract: Circuit discovery aims to identify minimal subnetworks that are responsible for specific behaviors in large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches primarily rely on iterative edge pruning, which is computationally expensive and limited to coarse-grained units such as attention heads or MLP blocks, overlooking finer structures like individual neurons. We propose a node-level pruning framework for circuit discovery that addresses both scalability and granularity limitations. Our method introduces learnable masks across multiple levels of granularity, from entire blocks to individual neurons, within a unified optimization objective. Granularity-specific sparsity penalties guide the pruning process, allowing a comprehensive compression in a single fine-tuning run. Empirically, our approach identifies circuits that are smaller in nodes than those discovered by prior methods; moreover, we demonstrate that many neurons deemed important by coarse methods are actually irrelevant, while still maintaining task performance. Furthermore, our method has a significantly lower memory footprint, 5-10x, as it does not require keeping intermediate activations in the memory to work.

Abstract: We establish a precise correspondence between decision-making agents in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and one-input process functions, the classical limit of higher-order quantum operations. In this identification an agent's policy and memory update combine into a process function w that interacts with a POMDP environment via the link product. This suggests a dual interpretation: in the physics view, the process function acts as the environment into which local operations (agent interventions) are inserted, whereas in the AI view it encodes the agent and the inserted functions represent environments. We extend this perspective to multi-agent systems by identifying observation-independent decentralized POMDPs as natural domains for multi-input process functions.

Abstract: The ERC4907 standard enables rentable Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) but is limited to single-user, single-time-slot authorization, which severely limits its applicability and efficiency in decentralized multi-slot scheduling scenarios. To address this limitation, this paper proposes Multi-slot ERC4907 (M-ERC4907) extension method. The M-ERC4907 method introduces novel functionalities to support the batch configuration of multiple time slots and simultaneous authorization of multiple users, thereby effectively eliminating the rigid sequential authorization constraint of ERC4907. The experiment was conducted on the Remix development platform. Experimental results show that the M-ERC4907 method significantly reduces on-chain transactions and overall Gas consumption, leading to enhanced scalability and resource allocation efficiency.

Abstract: The latency and power consumption of large language models (LLMs) are major constraints when serving them across a wide spectrum of hardware platforms, from mobile edge devices to cloud GPU clusters. Benchmarking is crucial for optimizing efficiency in both model deployment and next-generation model development. To address this need, we open-source a simple profiling tool, \textbf{ELANA}, for evaluating LLMs. ELANA is designed as a lightweight, academic-friendly profiler for analyzing model size, key-value (KV) cache size, prefilling latency (Time-to-first-token, TTFT), generation latency (Time-per-output-token, TPOT), and end-to-end latency (Time-to-last-token, TTLT) of LLMs on both multi-GPU and edge GPU platforms. It supports all publicly available models on Hugging Face and offers a simple command-line interface, along with optional energy consumption logging. Moreover, ELANA is fully compatible with popular Hugging Face APIs and can be easily customized or adapted to compressed or low bit-width models, making it ideal for research on efficient LLMs or for small-scale proof-of-concept studies. We release the ELANA profiling tool at: https://github.com/enyac-group/Elana.

Abstract: Access control policies are vital for securing modern cloud computing, where organizations must manage access to sensitive data across thousands of users in distributed system settings. Cloud administrators typically write and update policies manually, which can be an error-prone and time-consuming process and can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities. Existing approaches based on symbolic analysis have demonstrated success in automated debugging and repairing access control policies; however, their generalizability is limited in the context of cloud-based access control. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been utilized for automated program repair; however, their applicability to repairing cloud access control policies remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce CloudFix, the first automated policy repair framework for cloud access control that combines formal methods with LLMs. Given an access control policy and a specification of allowed and denied access requests, CloudFix employs Formal Methods-based Fault Localization to identify faulty statements in the policy and leverages LLMs to generate potential repairs, which are then verified using SMT solvers. To evaluate CloudFix, we curated a dataset of 282 real-world AWS access control policies extracted from forum posts and augmented them with synthetically generated request sets based on real scenarios. Our experimental results show that CloudFix improves repair accuracy over a Baseline implementation across varying request sizes. Our work is the first to leverage LLMs for policy repair, showcasing the effectiveness of LLMs for access control and enabling efficient and automated repair of cloud access control policies. We make our tool Cloudfix and AWS dataset publicly available.

Abstract: The rapid growth of Web3.0 is transforming the Internet from a centralized structure to decentralized, which empowers users with unprecedented self-sovereignty over their own data. However, in the context of decentralized data access within Web3.0, it is imperative to cope with efficiency concerns caused by the replication of redundant data, as well as security vulnerabilities caused by data inconsistency. To address these challenges, we develop a Trustworthy Decentralized Cooperative Caching (TDC-Cache) framework for Web3.0 to ensure efficient caching and enhance system resilience against adversarial threats. This framework features a two-layer architecture, wherein the Decentralized Oracle Network (DON) layer serves as a trusted intermediary platform for decentralized caching, bridging the contents from decentralized storage and the content requests from users. In light of the complexity of Web3.0 network topologies and data flows, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Decentralized Caching (DRL-DC) for TDC-Cache to dynamically optimize caching strategies of distributed oracles. Furthermore, we develop a Proof of Cooperative Learning (PoCL) consensus to maintain the consistency of decentralized caching decisions within DON. Experimental results show that, compared with existing approaches, the proposed framework reduces average access latency by 20%, increases the cache hit rate by at most 18%, and improves the average success consensus rate by 10%. Overall, this paper serves as a first foray into the investigation of decentralized caching framework and strategy for Web3.0.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet their high computational demands pose significant challenges for real-time inference, especially in multi-user server speculative decoding and resource-constrained environments. Speculative decoding has emerged as a promising technique to accelerate LLM inference by using lightweight draft models to generate candidate tokens, which are subsequently verified by a larger, more accurate model. However, ensuring both high goodput (the effective rate of accepted tokens) and fairness across multiple draft servers cooperating with a central verification server remains an open challenge. This paper introduces GOODSPEED, a novel distributed inference framework that optimizes goodput through adaptive speculative decoding. GOODSPEED employs a central verification server that coordinates a set of heterogeneous draft servers, each running a small language model to generate speculative tokens. To manage resource allocation effectively, GOODSPEED incorporates a gradient scheduling algorithm that dynamically assigns token verification tasks, maximizing a logarithmic utility function to ensure proportional fairness across servers. By processing speculative outputs from all draft servers in parallel, the framework enables efficient collaboration between the verification server and distributed draft generators, streamlining both latency and throughput. Through rigorous fluid sample path analysis, we show that GOODSPEED converges to the optimal goodput allocation in steady-state conditions and maintains near-optimal performance with provably bounded error under dynamic workloads. These results demonstrate that GOODSPEED provides a scalable, fair and efficient solution for multi-server speculative decoding in distributed LLM inference systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: As both ML training and inference are increasingly distributed, parallelization techniques that shard (divide) ML model across GPUs of a distributed system, are often deployed. With such techniques, there is a high prevalence of data-dependent communication and computation operations where communication is exposed, leaving as high as 1.7x ideal performance on the table. Prior works harness the fact that ML model state and inputs are already sharded, and employ careful overlap of individual computation/communication shards. While such coarse-grain overlap is promising, in this work, we instead make a case for finer-grain compute-communication overlap which we term FiCCO, where we argue for finer-granularity, one-level deeper overlap than at shard-level, to unlock compute/communication overlap for a wider set of network topologies, finer-grain dataflow and more. We show that FiCCO opens up a wider design space of execution schedules than possible at shard-level alone. At the same time, decomposition of ML operations into smaller operations (done in both shard-based and finer-grain techniques) causes operation-level inefficiency losses. To balance the two, we first present a detailed characterization of these inefficiency losses, then present a design space of FiCCO schedules, and finally overlay the schedules with concomitant inefficiency signatures. Doing so helps us design heuristics that frameworks and runtimes can harness to select bespoke FiCCO schedules based on the nature of underlying ML operations. Finally, to further minimize contention inefficiencies inherent with operation overlap, we offload communication to GPU DMA engines. We evaluate several scenarios from realistic ML deployments and demonstrate that our proposed bespoke schedules deliver up to 1.6x speedup and our heuristics provide accurate guidance in 81% of unseen scenarios.

Abstract: Modern cloud platforms increasingly host large-scale deep learning (DL) workloads, demanding high-throughput, low-latency GPU scheduling. However, the growing heterogeneity of GPU clusters and limited visibility into application characteristics pose major challenges for existing schedulers, which often rely on offline profiling or application-specific assumptions. We present RLTune, an application-agnostic reinforcement learning (RL)-based scheduling framework that dynamically prioritizes and allocates DL jobs on heterogeneous GPU clusters. RLTune integrates RL-driven prioritization with MILP-based job-to-node mapping to optimize system-wide objectives such as job completion time (JCT), queueing delay, and resource utilization. Trained on large-scale production traces from Microsoft Philly, Helios, and Alibaba, RLTune improves GPU utilization by up to 20%, reduces queueing delay by up to 81%, and shortens JCT by as much as 70 percent. Unlike prior approaches, RLTune generalizes across diverse workloads without requiring per-job profiling, making it practical for cloud providers to deploy at scale for more efficient, fair, and sustainable DL workload management.

Abstract: Erasure coding with wide stripes is increasingly adopted to reduce storage overhead in large-scale storage systems. However, existing Locally Repairable Codes (LRCs) exhibit structural limitations in this setting: inflated local groups increase single-node repair cost, multi-node failures frequently trigger expensive global repair, and reliability degrades sharply. We identify a key root cause: local and global parity blocks are designed independently, preventing them from cooperating during repair. We present Cascaded Parity LRCs (CP-LRCs), a new family of wide stripe LRCs that embed structured dependency between parity blocks by decomposing a global parity block across all local parity blocks. This creates a cascaded parity group that preserves MDS-level fault tolerance while enabling low-bandwidth single-node and multi-node repairs. We provide a general coefficient-generation framework, develop repair algorithms exploiting cascading, and instantiate the design with CP-Azure and CP-Uniform. Evaluations on Alibaba Cloud show reductions in repair time of up to 41% for single-node failures and 26% for two-node failures.

Abstract: Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) has emerged as a powerful approach for addressing data heterogeneity and ensuring privacy in large distributed IoT environments. By clustering clients and training cluster-specific models, CFL enables personalized models tailored to groups of heterogeneous clients. However, conventional CFL approaches suffer from fragmented learning for training independent global models for each cluster and fail to take advantage of collective cluster insights. This paper advocates a shift to hierarchical CFL, allowing bi-level aggregation to train cluster-specific models at the edge and a unified global model at the cloud. This shift improves training efficiency yet might introduce communication challenges. To this end, we propose CFLHKD, a novel personalization scheme for integrating hierarchical cluster knowledge into CFL. Built upon multi-teacher knowledge distillation, CFLHKD enables inter-cluster knowledge sharing while preserving cluster-specific personalization. CFLHKD adopts a bi-level aggregation to bridge the gap between local and global learning. Extensive evaluations of standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that CFLHKD outperforms representative baselines in cluster-specific and global model accuracy and achieves a performance improvement of 3.32-7.57\%.

Abstract: DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp introduces a sparse attention mechanism that significantly reduces inference latency in long-context scenarios. Although the overall throughput has improved greatly, the Decode-stage of PD disaggregation remains to be a major bottleneck. This bottleneck primarily stems from the conflict between linear growth of Latent-Cache with sequence length and the limited GPU memory capacity, which constrains the feasible batch-size and thereby suppresses Decode-stage throughput.
  To address this challenge, we propose ESS (Extended Sparse Server), an offload-centric system design tailored for DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp. ESS selectively offloads Latent-Cache to CPU memory while preserving latency-critical components on GPU. By freeing up GPU memory, ESS effectively decoupling batch-size scaling from GPU memory constraints. This design significantly improves Decode-stage throughput, thereby reducing deployment costs in real-world settings.
  Our high-fidelity simulations show that ESS delivers 69.4\% throughput improvement at 32K context length and up to 123\% throughput improvement at 128K, demonstrating its effectiveness for large-context inference workloads. These results highlight ESS as a practical and scalable solution for long-context LLM serving.

Abstract: Growing interest in semiconductor workforce development has generated demand for platforms capable of supporting large numbers of independent hardware designs for research and training without imposing high per-project overhead. Traditional multi-project wafer (MPW) services based solely on physical co-placement have historically met this need, yet their scalability breaks down as project counts rise. Recent efforts towards scalable chip tapeouts mitigate these limitations by integrating many small designs within a shared die and attempt to amortize costly resources such as IO pads and memory macros. However, foundational principles for arranging, linking, and validating such densely integrated design sites have received limited systematic investigation. This work presents a new approach with three key techniques to address this gap. First, we establish a structured formulation of the design space that enables automated, algorithm-driven packing of many projects, replacing manual layout practices. Second, we introduce an architecture that exploits only the narrow-area regions between sites to deliver on off-chip communication and other shared needs. Third, we provide a practical approach for on-chip power domains enabling per-project power characterization at a standard laboratory bench and requiring no expertise in low-power ASIC design. Experimental results show that our approach achieves substantial area reductions of up to 13x over state-of-the-art physical-only aggregation methods, offering a scalable and cost-effective path forward for large-scale tapeout environments.

Abstract: Developers who primarily engage with software often struggle to incorporate custom hardware into their applications, even though specialized silicon can provide substantial benefits to machine learning and AI, as well as to the application domains that they enable. This work investigates how a chip can be generated from a high-level object-oriented software specification, targeting introductory-level chip design learners with only very light performance requirements, while maintaining mental continuity between the chip layout and the software source program. In our approach, each software object is represented as a corresponding region on the die, producing a one-to-one structural mapping that preserves these familiar abstractions throughout the design flow. To support this mapping, we employ a modular construction strategy in which vertically composed IP blocks implement the behavioral protocols expressed in software. A direct syntactic translation, however, cannot meet hardware-level efficiency or communication constraints. For this reason, we leverage formal type systems based on sequences that check whether interactions between hardware modules adhere to the communication patterns described in the software model. We further examine hardware interconnect strategies for composing many such modules and develop layout techniques suited to this object-aligned design style. Together, these contributions preserve mental continuity from software to chip design for new learners and enables practical layout generation, ultimately reducing the expertise required for software developers to participate in chip creation.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing, inspired by biological neural systems, holds immense promise for ultra-low-power and real-time inference applications. However, limited access to flexible, open-source platforms continues to hinder widespread adoption and experimentation. In this paper, we present a low-cost neuromorphic processor implemented on a Xilinx Zynq-7000 FPGA platform. The processor supports all-to-all configurable connectivity and employs the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model with customizable parameters such as threshold, synaptic weights, and refractory period. Communication with the host system is handled via a UART interface, enabling runtime reconfiguration without hardware resynthesis. The architecture was validated using benchmark datasets including the Iris classification and MNIST digit recognition tasks. Post-synthesis results highlight the design's energy efficiency and scalability, establishing its viability as a research-grade neuromorphic platform that is both accessible and adaptable for real-world spiking neural network applications. This implementation will be released as open source following project completion.

Abstract: For decades, sampling-based techniques have been the de facto standard for accelerating microarchitecture simulation, with the Basic Block Vector (BBV) serving as the cornerstone program representation. Yet, the BBV's fundamental limitations: order-dependent IDs that prevent cross-program knowledge reuse and a lack of semantic content predictive of hardware performance have left a massive potential for optimization untapped.
  To address these gaps, we introduce SemanticBBV, a novel, two-stage framework that generates robust, performance-aware signatures for cross-program simulation reuse. First, a lightweight RWKV-based semantic encoder transforms assembly basic blocks into rich Basic Block Embeddings (BBEs), capturing deep functional semantics. Second, an order-invariant Set Transformer aggregates these BBEs, weighted by execution frequency, into a final signature. Crucially, this stage is co-trained with a dual objective: a triplet loss for signature distinctiveness and a Cycles Per Instruction (CPI) regression task, directly imbuing the signature with performance sensitivity. Our evaluation demonstrates that SemanticBBV not only matches traditional BBVs in single-program accuracy but also enables unprecedented cross-program analysis. By simulating just 14 universal program points, we estimated the performance of ten SPEC CPU benchmarks with 86.3% average accuracy, achieving a 7143x simulation speedup. Furthermore, the signature shows strong adaptability to new microarchitectures with minimal fine-tuning.

Abstract: Short-term voltage stability assessment (STVSA) is critical for secure power system operation. While classical machine learning-based methods have demonstrated strong performance, they still face challenges in robustness under adversarial conditions. This paper proposes QSTAformer-a tailored quantum-enhanced Transformer architecture that embeds parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) into attention mechanisms-for robust and efficient STVSA. A dedicated adversarial training strategy is developed to defend against both white-box and gray-box attacks. Furthermore, diverse PQC architectures are benchmarked to explore trade-offs between expressiveness, convergence, and efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically investigate the adversarial vulnerability of quantum machine learning-based STVSA. Case studies on the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate that QSTAformer achieves competitive accuracy, reduced complexity, and stronger robustness, underscoring its potential for secure and scalable STVSA under adversarial conditions.

Abstract: This paper studies the efficient implementation of safety filters that are designed using control barrier functions (CBFs), which minimally modify a nominal controller to render it safe with respect to a prescribed set of states. Although CBF-based safety filters are often implemented by solving a quadratic program (QP) in real time, the use of off-the-shelf solvers for such optimization problems poses a challenge in applications where control actions need to be computed efficiently at very high frequencies. In this paper, we introduce a closed-form expression for controllers obtained through CBF-based safety filters. This expression is obtained by partitioning the state-space into different regions, with a different closed-form solution in each region. We leverage this formula to introduce a resource-aware implementation of CBF-based safety filters that detects changes in the partition region and uses the closed-form expression between changes. We showcase the applicability of our approach in examples ranging from aerospace control to safe reinforcement learning.

Abstract: This paper develops a unified modeling framework to capture the equilibrium-state interactions among ride-hailing companies, travelers, and traffic of mixed-autonomy transportation networks. Our framework integrates four interrelated sub-modules: (i) the operational behavior of representative ride-hailing Mixed-Fleet Traffic Network Companies (MiFleet TNCs) managing autonomous vehicle (AV) and human-driven vehicle (HV) fleets, (ii) traveler mode-choice decisions taking into account travel costs and waiting time, (iii) capped customer waiting times to reflect the option available to travelers not to wait for TNCs' service beyond his/her patience and to resort to existing travel modes, and (iv) a flow-dependent traffic congestion model for travel times. A key modeling feature distinguishes AVs and HVs across the pickup and service (customer-on-board) stages: AVs follow Wardrop pickup routes but may deviate during service under company coordination, whereas HVs operate in the reverse manner. The overall framework is formulated as a Nonlinear Complementarity Problem (NCP), which is equivalent to a Variational Inequality(VI) formulation based on which the existence of a variational equilibrium solution to the traffic model is established. Numerical experiments examine how AV penetration and Wardrop relaxation factors, which bound route deviation, affect company, traveler, and system performance to various degrees. The results provide actionable insights for policymakers on regulating AV adoption and company vehicle deviation behavior in modern-day traffic systems that are fast changing due to the advances in technology and information accessibility.

Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid model-AI framework for real-time dynamic security assessment of frequency stability in power systems. The proposed method rapidly estimates key frequency parameters under a dynamic set of disturbances, which are continuously updated based on operating conditions and unit commitment. To achieve this, the framework builds on a modal-based formulation of the system frequency response (SFR), which leverages the system's eigenstructure to predict key frequency stability metrics. A Deep Sets-inspired neural network is employed to estimate the complex modal coefficients required by the modal-based SFR approach, formulated as a permutation-equivariant learning problem. This enables fast and accurate prediction of the frequency nadir and its timing across different operating conditions and disturbances. The framework achieves scalability by reusing precomputed modal structures and updating only the disturbance-specific coefficients. It demonstrates strong generalization capabilities without requiring an extensive set of operating scenarios during training or the widespread deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs). The method is validated on the IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus systems, showing superior accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency compared to purely data-driven approaches.

Abstract: The paper discusses work done to expand and extend the capabilities of the open-source QUCS circuit simulator through the implementation of a computationally efficient time-domain steady-state analysis module, supporting simulation of autonomous circuits. To our knowledge, this represents the first time such an analysis module has been implemented in the QUCS environment. Hitherto, the only available option was a harmonic-balance module which was strictly limited to non-autonomous (driven) circuits. The research has several important scientific and industrial applications in the area of large-signal steady-state analysis of autonomous circuits e.g. free-running and coupled oscillator circuit networks. The reported results will have great impact w.r.t. analyzing, synthesizing and optimizing oscillatory behavior of various important industrial circuits and systems. The developed tool, furthermore, introduces support for simulating noise performance of circuits operating under large-signal conditions. This paper is the first part of a two-part series documenting the implementation of a novel (coupled)-oscillator phase-noise simulator engine in the QUCS environment. The goal of this undertaking is the advancement of the open-source QUCS project towards becoming a viable competitor to the commercial simulators currently on the market.

We show that when the underlying digraph remains unchanged across all snapshots, the network attains complete SS herdability even in the presence of signed or layer dilations, a condition not applicable to static networks. This reveals a fundamental structural advantage of temporal dynamics and highlights a novel mechanism through which switching can overcome classical obstructions to herdability. To validate these conclusions, we utilize a more relaxed form of sign matching within each snapshot of the temporal network. Furthermore, we show that when all snapshots share the same underlying topology, the temporally switching network achieves $\mathcal{SS}$ herdability within just two snapshots, which is fewer than the number required for structural controllability. Several examples are included to demonstrate these results.

Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of safe and efficient area coverage using a multi-agent system operating in environments with obstacles. Applications such as environmental monitoring and search and rescue require robot swarms to cover large domains under resource constraints, making both coverage efficiency and safety essential. To address the efficiency aspect, we adopt the Density-Driven Control (D$^2$C) framework, which uses optimal transport theory to steer agents according to a reference distribution that encodes spatial coverage priorities. To ensure safety, we incorporate Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) into the framework. While CBFs are commonly used for collision avoidance, we extend their applicability by introducing obstacle-specific formulations for both circular and rectangular shapes. In particular, we analytically derive a unit normal vector based on the agent's position relative to the nearest face of a rectangular obstacle, improving safety enforcement in environments with non-smooth boundaries. Additionally, a velocity-dependent term is incorporated into the CBF to enhance collision avoidance. Simulation results validate the proposed method by demonstrating smoother navigation near obstacles and more efficient area coverage than the existing method, while still ensuring collision-free operation.

Abstract: Hybrid systems are an important concept in Cyber-Physical Systems modeling, for which multiphysics modeling from first principles and the reuse of models from libraries are key. To achieve this, DAEs must be used to specify the dynamics in each discrete state (or mode in our context). This led to the development of DAE-based equational languages supporting multiple modes, of which Modelica is a popular standard. Mode switching can be time- or state-based. Impulsive behaviors can occur at mode changes. While mode changes are well understood in particular physics (e.g., contact mechanics), this is not the case in physics-agnostic paradigms such as Modelica. This situation causes difficulties for the compilation of programs, often requiring users to manually smooth out mode changes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the hot restart at mode changes in such paradigms. We propose a mathematical meaning for hot restarts (such a mathematical meaning does not exist in general), as well as a combined structural and impulse analysis for mode changes, generating the hot restart even in the presence of impulses. Our algorithm detects at compile time if the mode change is insufficiently specified, in which case it returns diagnostics information to the user.

Abstract: Existing low-Earth-orbit (LEO) communication link analyses face two main challenges: (1) limited accuracy of 3D atmospheric refractivity reconstructed from sparsely sampled radiosonde data, and (2) numerical instability in previous non-uniform plane-wave ray-tracing algorithms (i.e., underflow under standard double precision), where non-uniform plane waves inevitably arise at complex-valued dielectric interfaces, is caused by extremely small atmospheric loss terms. To address these issues, we reconstruct a high-resolution 3D complex-valued refractivity model using numerical weather prediction data, and develop a fast and numerically stable non-uniform plane-wave ray tracer. The method remains stable in double precision and delivers a 24-fold speedup over high-precision benchmarks. Comparisons show that boresight-error deviations and path-loss differences between the rigorous method and the uniform-plane-wave approximation remain negligible, even under heavy precipitation. Although rays in a lossy atmosphere experience different phase- and attenuation-direction vectors-forming non-uniform plane waves-the resulting effective attenuation along the path is nearly identical to that predicted by the uniform-plane-wave model. These findings justify the continued use of uniform-plane-wave ray tracing in practical LEO link analyses.

Abstract: Codeshare agreements are contracts that allow two or more airlines to share seats on the same flight. These agreements, which are widespread in commercial aviation as a response to highly competitive environments, have enabled the expansion of airline networks without additional costs or risks for the companies involved. The literature presents ambiguous effects associated with the practice, with evidence of increased supply and reduced prices in situations of route complementarity, while also pointing to anti-competitive impacts in markets where companies act as competitors. A review of scientific production over time, including theoretical contributions and case studies, is essential to understand the evolution of these agreements and their implications, especially in the Brazilian context, marked by its own characteristics and particular regulatory history. Thus, this article reviews the literature on codesharing, with an emphasis on the Brazilian market, and uses the Litmaps computational tool, based on artificial intelligence techniques, to support the contextual analysis of publications through their citation relationships. The ultimate goal is to identify and evaluate the main evidence accumulated over decades on the effects of these agreements in Brazil. The joint analysis of the contributions allows us to outline the current state of knowledge, characterize specificities observed in the Brazilian market, and identify gaps that may guide future studies.

Abstract: Model-based control techniques have recently been investigated for the recommendation of medication dosages to address thyroid diseases. These techniques often rely on knowledge of internal hormone concentrations that cannot be measured from blood samples. Moreover, the measurable concentrations are typically only obtainable at irregular sampling times. In this work, we empirically verify a notion of sample-based detectability that accounts for irregular sampling of the measurable concentrations on two pituitary-thyroid loop models representing patients with hypo- and hyperthyroidism, respectively, and include the internal concentrations as states. We then implement sample-based moving horizon estimation for the models, and test its performance on virtual patients across a range of sampling schemes. Our study shows robust stability of the estimator across all scenarios, and that more frequent sampling leads to less estimation error in the presence of model uncertainty and misreported dosages.

Abstract: This paper addresses the verification and enforcement of prognosability and diagnosability for discreteevent systems (DESs) modeled by deterministic finite automata. We establish the equivalence between prognosability (respectively, diagnosability) and pre-normality over a subset of the non-faulty language (respectively, a suffix of the faulty language). We then demonstrate the existence of supremal prognosable (respectively, diagnosable) and normal sublanguages. Furthermore, an algorithm is then designed to compute the supremal controllable, normal, and prognosable (respectively, diagnosable) sublanguages. Since DESs are typically composed of multiple components operating in parallel, pure local supervisors are generally insufficient, as prognosability and diagnosability are global properties of a system. Given the limited work on enforcing prognosability or diagnosability in modular DESs, where these properties are enforced through local supervisors, this paper leverages a refined version of pre-normality to compute modular supervisors for local subsystems. The resulting closed-loop system is shown to be globally controllable, normal, and prognosable/ diagnosable. Examples are provided to illustrate the proposed method.

Abstract: This work presents a stochastic model predictive control (MPC) framework for linear systems subject to joint-in-time chance constraints under unknown disturbance distributions. Unlike existing stochastic MPC formulations that rely on parametric or Gaussian assumptions or require expensive offline computations, the proposed method leverages conformal prediction (CP) as a streamlined tool to construct finite-sample confidence regions for the system's stochastic error trajectories with minimal computational effort. These regions enable the relaxation of probabilistic constraints while providing formal guarantees. By employing an indirect feedback mechanism and a probabilistic set-based formulation, we prove recursive feasibility of the relaxed optimization problem and establish chance constraint satisfaction in closed-loop. Furthermore, we extend the approach to the more general output feedback setting with unknown measurement noise distributions. Given available noise samples, we establish satisfaction of the joint chance constraints and recursive feasibility via output measurements alone. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents an $\mathcal{H}_2 / \mathcal{H}_\infty$ minimization-based output-feedback controller for active aeroelastic vibration suppression in a cantilevered beam. First, a nonlinear structural model incorporating moderate deflection and aerodynamic loading is derived and discretized using the finite element method (FEM). Then, a low-order linear model is identified from random gaussian input response data from the FEM model to synthesize an output-feedback controller using the $\mathcal{H}_2 / \mathcal{H}_\infty$ framework. A frequency-weighted dynamic filter is introduced to emphasize disturbance frequencies of interest, enabling the controller to target dominant vibration modes. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique for vibration suppression and study its robustness to system parameter variations, including actuator placement.

Abstract: In recent years, the proliferation of misinformation and fake news has posed serious threats to individuals and society, spurring intense research into automated detection methods. Previous work showed that integrating content, user preferences, and propagation structure achieves strong performance, but leaves all graph-level representation learning entirely to the GNN, hiding any explicit topological cues. To close this gap, we introduce a lightweight enhancement: for each node, we append two classical graph-theoretic metrics, degree centrality and local clustering coefficient, to its original BERT and profile embeddings, thus explicitly flagging the roles of hub and community. In the UPFD Politifact subset, this simple modification boosts macro F1 from 0.7753 to 0.8344 over the original baseline. Our study not only demonstrates the practical value of explicit topology features in fake-news detection but also provides an interpretable, easily reproducible template for fusing graph metrics in other information-diffusion tasks.

Abstract: Studying how recommendation systems reshape social networks is difficult on live platforms: confounds abound, and controlled experiments risk user harm. We present an agent-based simulator where content production, tie formation, and a graph attention network (GAT) recommender co-evolve in a closed loop. We calibrate parameters using Mastodon data and validate out-of-sample against Bluesky (4--6\% error on structural metrics; 10--15\% on held-out temporal splits). Across 18 configurations at 100 agents, we find that \emph{activation timing} affects outcomes: introducing recommendations at $t=10$ vs.\ $t=40$ decreases transitivity by 10\% while engagement differs by $<$8\%. Delaying activation increases content diversity by 9\% while reducing modularity by 4\%. Scaling experiments ($n$ up to 5,000) show the effect persists but attenuates. Jacobian analysis confirms local stability under bounded reactance parameters. We release configuration schemas and reproduction scripts.

Abstract: Social video platforms shape how people access information, while recommendation systems can narrow exposure and increase the risk of toxic interaction. Previous research has often examined text or users in isolation, overlooking the structural context in which such toxic interactions occur. Without considering who interacts with whom and around what content, it is difficult to explain why negative expressions cluster within particular communities. To address this issue, this study focuses on the Chinese social video platform Bilibili, incorporating video-level information as the environment for user expression, modeling users and videos in an interaction matrix. After normalization and dimensionality reduction, we perform separate clustering on both sides of the video-user interaction matrix with K-means. Cluster assignments facilitate comparisons of user behavior, including message length, posting frequency, and source (barrage and comment), as well as textual features such as sentiment and toxicity, and video attributes defined by uploaders. Such a clustering approach integrates structural ties with content signals to identify stable groups of videos and users. We find clear stratification in interaction style (message length, comment ratio) across user clusters, while sentiment and toxicity differences are weak or inconsistent across video clusters. Across video clusters, viewing volume exhibits a clear hierarchy, with higher exposure groups concentrating more toxic expressions. For such a group, platforms should require timely intervention during periods of rapid growth. Across user clusters, comment ratio and message length form distinct hierarchies, and several clusters with longer and comment-oriented messages exhibit lower toxicity. For such groups, platforms should strengthen mechanisms that sustain rational dialogue and encourage engagement across topics.

Abstract: VTuber agencies -- multichannel networks (MCNs) that bundle Virtual YouTubers (VTubers) on YouTube -- curate portfolios of channels and coordinate programming, cross appearances, and branding in the live-streaming VTuber ecosystem. It remains unclear whether affiliation binds fans to a single channel or instead encourages movement within a portfolio that buffers exit, and how these micro level dynamics relate to meso level audience overlap. This study examines how affiliation shapes short horizon viewer trajectories and the organization of audience overlap networks by contrasting agency affiliated and independent VTubers. Using a large, multiyear, fan centered panel of VTuber live stream engagement on YouTube, we construct monthly audience overlap between creators with a similarity measure that is robust to audience size asymmetries. At the micro level, we track retention, changes in the primary creator watched (oshi), and inactivity; at the meso level, we compare structural properties of affiliation specific subgraphs and visualize viewer state transitions. The analysis identifies a pattern of loose mobility: fans tend to remain active while reallocating attention within the same affiliation type, with limited leakage across affiliation type. Network results indicate convergence in global overlap while local neighborhoods within affiliated subgraphs remain persistently denser. Flow diagrams reveal circulate and recapture dynamics that stabilize participation without relying on single channel lock in. We contribute a reusable measurement framework for VTuber live streaming that links micro level trajectories to meso level organization and informs research on creator labor, influencer marketing, and platform governance on video platforms. We do not claim causal effects; the observed regularities are consistent with proximity engineered by VTuber agencies and coordinated recapture.

Abstract: Hybrid work policy, especially return-to-office requirements, remains a globally salient topic as workers, companies, and governments continue to debate and disagree. Despite extensive discussions on the benefits and drawbacks of remote and hybrid arrangements, the optimal number of remote days that jointly considers multiple organizational outcomes has not been empirically established. Focusing on two critical career outcomes -- turnover risk and promotion -- we examine how remote work frequency shapes employee trajectories using large-scale observational activity data from a company with over one million employees. We find that increased remote-work frequency is associated with an initial decrease and then an increase in turnover, while promotion likelihood initially rises and then declines. Accordingly, we identify approximately two remote days per week as an optimal balance -- maximizing promotion, a positive outcome for employees, while minimizing turnover, which is undesirable for organizations and may indicate negative employee experiences. These patterns vary across subgroups defined by gender, role type, and leadership status. Several notable results emerge. First, male employees derive greater promotion benefits from remote work than female employees. Second, support workers (non-core business roles) do not experience promotion gains, and the reduction in turnover at their optimal remote-work frequency is marginal compared with employees in core business roles. Third, organizational leaders face greater challenges in remote settings than individual contributors: their turnover risk increases substantially at higher remote frequencies, and their likelihood of promotion decreases as remote frequency rises. We further show that time-allocation patterns partly explain how remote-work frequency influences these career outcomes.

Abstract: This paper investigates how political campaigns engaged UK football fan communities on Twitter in the aftermath of the Brexit Referendum (2016-2017). Football fandom, with its strong collective identities and tribal behaviours, offers fertile ground for political influence. Combining social network and content analysis, we examine how political discourse became embedded in football conversations. We show that a wide range of actors -- including parties, media, activist groups, and pseudonymous influencers -- mobilised support, provoked reactions, and shaped opinion within these communities. Through case studies of hashtag hijacking, embedded activism, and political "megaphones", we illustrate how campaigns leveraged fan cultures to amplify political messages. Our findings highlight mechanisms of political influence in ostensibly non-political online spaces and point toward the development of a broader framework in future work.

Abstract: In an era where social media platforms are central to political communication, the activity of bots raises pressing concerns about amplification, manipulation, and misinformation. Drawing on more than 315 million tweets posted from August 2018 to June 2022, we examine behavioural patterns, sentiment dynamics, and the thematic focus of bot- versus human-generated content spanning the 2018 Brazilian presidential election and the lead-up to the 2022 contest. Our analysis shows that bots relied disproportionately on retweets and replies, with reply activity spiking after the 2018 election, suggesting tactics of conversational infiltration and amplification. Sentiment analysis indicates that bots maintained a narrower emotional tone, in contrast to humans, whose sentiment fluctuated more strongly with political events. Topic modelling further reveals bots' repetitive, Bolsonaro-centric messaging, while human users engaged with a broader range of candidates, civic concerns, and personal reflections. These findings underscore bots' role as amplifiers of narrow agendas and their potential to distort online political discourse.

Abstract: Representing and rendering dynamic scenes with complex motions remains challenging in computer vision and graphics. Recent dynamic view synthesis methods achieve high-quality rendering but often produce physically implausible motions. We introduce NeHaD, a neural deformation field for dynamic Gaussian Splatting governed by Hamiltonian mechanics. Our key observation is that existing methods using MLPs to predict deformation fields introduce inevitable biases, resulting in unnatural dynamics. By incorporating physics priors, we achieve robust and realistic dynamic scene rendering. Hamiltonian mechanics provides an ideal framework for modeling Gaussian deformation fields due to their shared phase-space structure, where primitives evolve along energy-conserving trajectories. We employ Hamiltonian neural networks to implicitly learn underlying physical laws governing deformation. Meanwhile, we introduce Boltzmann equilibrium decomposition, an energy-aware mechanism that adaptively separates static and dynamic Gaussians based on their spatial-temporal energy states for flexible rendering. To handle real-world dissipation, we employ second-order symplectic integration and local rigidity regularization as physics-informed constraints for robust dynamics modeling. Additionally, we extend NeHaD to adaptive streaming through scale-aware mipmapping and progressive optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NeHaD achieves physically plausible results with a rendering quality-efficiency trade-off. To our knowledge, this is the first exploration leveraging Hamiltonian mechanics for neural Gaussian deformation, enabling physically realistic dynamic scene rendering with streaming capabilities.

Abstract: We propose DeMapGS, a structured Gaussian Splatting framework that jointly optimizes deformable surfaces and surface-attached 2D Gaussian splats. By anchoring splats to a deformable template mesh, our method overcomes topological inconsistencies and enhances editing flexibility, addressing limitations of prior Gaussian Splatting methods that treat points independently. The unified representation in our method supports extraction of high-fidelity diffuse, normal, and displacement maps, enabling the reconstructed mesh to inherit the photorealistic rendering quality of Gaussian Splatting. To support robust optimization, we introduce a gradient diffusion strategy that propagates supervision across the surface, along with an alternating 2D/3D rendering scheme to handle concave regions. Experiments demonstrate that DeMapGS achieves state-of-the-art mesh reconstruction quality and enables downstream applications for Gaussian splats such as editing and cross-object manipulation through a shared parametric surface.

Abstract: Nonprehensile manipulation, such as pushing objects across cluttered environments, presents a challenging control problem due to complex contact dynamics and long-horizon planning requirements. In this work, we propose HeRD, a hierarchical reinforcement learning-diffusion policy that decomposes pushing tasks into two levels: high-level goal selection and low-level trajectory generation. We employ a high-level reinforcement learning (RL) agent to select intermediate spatial goals, and a low-level goal-conditioned diffusion model to generate feasible, efficient trajectories to reach them.
  This architecture combines the long-term reward maximizing behaviour of RL with the generative capabilities of diffusion models. We evaluate our method in a 2D simulation environment and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline in success rate, path efficiency, and generalization across multiple environment configurations. Our results suggest that hierarchical control with generative low-level planning is a promising direction for scalable, goal-directed nonprehensile manipulation.

Abstract: Industrial automation with six-axis robotic arms is critical for many manufacturing tasks, including welding and additive manufacturing applications; however, many of these operations are functionally redundant due to the symmetrical tool axis, which effectively makes the operation a five-axis task. Exploiting this redundancy is crucial for achieving the desired workspace and dexterity required for the feasibility and optimisation of toolpath planning. Inverse kinematics algorithms can solve this in a fast, reactive framework, but these techniques are underutilised over the more computationally expensive offline planning methods. We propose a novel algorithm to solve functionally redundant inverse kinematics for robotic manipulation utilising a task space decomposition approach, the damped least-squares method and Halley's method to achieve fast and robust solutions with reduced joint motion. We evaluate our methodology in the case of toolpath optimisation in a cold spray coating application on a non-planar surface. The functionally redundant inverse kinematics algorithm can quickly solve motion plans that minimise joint motion, expanding the feasible operating space of the complex toolpath. We validate our approach on an industrial ABB manipulator and cold-spray gun executing the computed toolpath.

Abstract: Spatially inhomogeneous magnetic fields offer a valuable, non-visual information source for positioning. Among systems leveraging this, magnetic field-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems are particularly attractive because they can provide positioning information and build a magnetic field map on the fly. Moreover, they have bounded error within mapped regions. However, state-of-the-art methods typically require low-drift odometry data provided by visual odometry or a wheel encoder, etc. This is because these systems need to minimize/reduce positioning errors while exploring, which happens when they are in unmapped regions. To address these limitations, this work proposes a loosely coupled and a tightly coupled inertial magnetic SLAM (IM-SLAM) system. The proposed systems use commonly available low-cost sensors: an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a magnetometer array, and a barometer. The use of non-visual data provides a significant advantage over visual-based systems, making it robust to low-visibility conditions. Both systems employ state-space representations, and magnetic field models on different scales. The difference lies in how they use a local and global magnetic field model. The loosely coupled system uses these models separately in two state-space models, while the tightly coupled system integrates them into one state-space model. Experiment results show that the tightly coupled IM-SLAM system achieves lower positioning errors than the loosely coupled system in most scenarios, with typical errors on the order of meters per 100 meters traveled. These results demonstrate the feasiblity of developing a full 3D IM-SLAM systems using low-cost sensors and the potential of applying these systems in emergency response scenarios such as mine/fire rescue.

Abstract: This paper presents a reinforcement learning framework that incorporates a Contextual Reward Machine for task-oriented grasping. The Contextual Reward Machine reduces task complexity by decomposing grasping tasks into manageable sub-tasks. Each sub-task is associated with a stage-specific context, including a reward function, an action space, and a state abstraction function. This contextual information enables efficient intra-stage guidance and improves learning efficiency by reducing the state-action space and guiding exploration within clearly defined boundaries. In addition, transition rewards are introduced to encourage or penalize transitions between stages which guides the model toward desirable stage sequences and further accelerates convergence. When integrated with the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, the proposed method achieved a 95% success rate across 1,000 simulated grasping tasks encompassing diverse objects, affordances, and grasp topologies. It outperformed the state-of-the-art methods in both learning speed and success rate. The approach was transferred to a real robot, where it achieved a success rate of 83.3% in 60 grasping tasks over six affordances. These experimental results demonstrate superior accuracy, data efficiency, and learning efficiency. They underscore the model's potential to advance task-oriented grasping in both simulated and real-world settings.

Abstract: In our work we not explicitly hint that it is a misconception to think that humans learn fast. Learning process takes time. Babies start learning to move in the restricted liquid area called placenta. Children often are limited by underdeveloped body. Even adults are not allowed to participate in complex competitions right away. However, with robots, when learning from scratch, we often don't have the privilege of waiting for dozen millions of steps. "Swaddling" regularization is responsible for restraining an agent in rapid but unstable development penalizing action strength in a specific way not affecting actions directly. The Symphony, Transitional-policy Deterministic Actor and Critic algorithm, is a concise combination of different ideas for possibility of training humanoid robots from scratch with Sample Efficiency, Sample Proximity and Safety of Actions in mind. It is no secret that continuous increase in Gaussian noise without appropriate smoothing is harmful for motors and gearboxes. Compared to Stochastic algorithms, we set a limited parametric noise and promote a reduced strength of actions, safely increasing entropy, since the actions are kind of immersed in weaker noise. When actions require more extreme values, actions rise above the weak noise. Training becomes empirically much safer for both the environment around and the robot's mechanisms. We use Fading Replay Buffer: using a fixed formula containing the hyperbolic tangent, we adjust the batch sampling probability: the memory contains a recent memory and a long-term memory trail. Fading Replay Buffer allows us to use Temporal Advantage when we improve the current Critic Network prediction compared to the exponential moving average. Temporal Advantage allows us to update Actor and Critic in one pass, as well as combine Actor and Critic in one Object and implement their Losses in one line.

Abstract: We propose Conformal Lie-group Action Prediction Sets (CLAPS), a symmetry-aware conformal prediction-based algorithm that constructs, for a given action, a set guaranteed to contain the resulting system configuration at a user-defined probability. Our assurance holds under both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, non-asymptotically, and does not require strong assumptions about the true system dynamics, the uncertainty sources, or the quality of the approximate dynamics model. Typically, uncertainty quantification is tackled by making strong assumptions about the error distribution or magnitude, or by relying on uncalibrated uncertainty estimates - i.e., with no link to frequentist probabilities - which are insufficient for safe control. Recently, conformal prediction has emerged as a statistical framework capable of providing distribution-free probabilistic guarantees on test-time prediction accuracy. While current conformal methods treat robots as Euclidean points, many systems have non-Euclidean configurations, e.g., some mobile robots have SE(2). In this work, we rigorously analyze configuration errors using Lie groups, extending previous Euclidean Space theoretical guarantees to SE(2). Our experiments on a simulated JetBot, and on a real MBot, suggest that by considering the configuration space's structure, our symmetry-informed nonconformity score leads to more volume-efficient prediction regions which represent the underlying uncertainty better than existing approaches.

Abstract: Mobile robots are increasingly utilized in agriculture to automate labor-intensive tasks such as weeding, sowing, harvesting and soil analysis. Recently, agricultural robots have been developed to detect and remove weeds using mechanical tools or precise herbicide sprays. Mechanical weeding is inefficient over large fields, and herbicides harm the soil ecosystem. Laser weeding with mobile robots has emerged as a sustainable alternative in precision farming. In this paper, we present an autonomous weeding robot that uses controlled exposure to a low energy laser beam for weed removal. The proposed robot is six-wheeled with a novel double four-bar suspension for higher stability. The laser is guided towards the detected weeds by a three-dimensional linear actuation mechanism. Field tests have demonstrated the robot's capability to navigate agricultural terrains effectively by overcoming obstacles up to 15 cm in height. At an optimal speed of 42.5 cm/s, the robot achieves a weed detection rate of 86.2\% and operating time of 87 seconds per meter. The laser actuation mechanism maintains a minimal mean positional error of 1.54 mm, combined with a high hit rate of 97\%, ensuring effective and accurate weed removal. This combination of speed, accuracy, and efficiency highlights the robot's potential for significantly enhancing precision farming practices.

Abstract: Tendon-driven under-actuated robotic fingers provide advantages for dexterous manipulation through reduced actuator requirements and simplified mechanical design. However, achieving both high load capacity and adaptive compliance in a compact form remains challenging. This paper presents an under-actuated tendon-driven robotic finger (UTRF) featuring a synchronous tendon routing that mechanically couples all joints with fixed angular velocity ratios, enabling the entire finger to be actuated by a single actuator. This approach significantly reduces the number of actuators required in multi-finger hands, resulting in a lighter and more compact structure without sacrificing stiffness or compliance. The kinematic and static models of the finger are derived, incorporating tendon elasticity to predict structural stiffness. A single-finger prototype was fabricated and tested under static loading, showing an average deflection prediction error of 1.0 mm (0.322% of total finger length) and a measured stiffness of 1.2x10^3 N/m under a 3 kg tip load. Integration into a five-finger robotic hand (UTRF-RoboHand) demonstrates effective object manipulation across diverse scenarios, confirming that the proposed routing achieves predictable stiffness and reliable grasping performance with a minimal actuator count.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires robots to follow natural language instructions and navigate complex environments without prior maps. While recent vision-language large models demonstrate strong reasoning abilities, they often underperform task-specific panoramic small models in VLN tasks. To address this, we propose CLASH (Collaborative Large-Small Hierarchy), a VLN-CE framework that integrates a reactive small-model planner (RSMP) with a reflective large-model reasoner (RLMR). RSMP adopts a causal-learning-based dual-branch architecture to enhance generalization, while RLMR leverages panoramic visual prompting with chain-of-thought reasoning to support interpretable spatial understanding and navigation. We further introduce an uncertainty-aware collaboration mechanism (UCM) that adaptively fuses decisions from both models. For obstacle avoidance, in simulation, we replace the rule-based controller with a fully learnable point-goal policy, and in real-world deployment, we design a LiDAR-based clustering module for generating navigable waypoints and pair it with an online SLAM-based local controller. CLASH achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) results (ranking 1-st) on the VLN-CE leaderboard, significantly improving SR and SPL on the test-unseen set over the previous SoTA methods. Real-world experiments demonstrate CLASH's strong robustness, validating its effectiveness in both simulation and deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Current embodied AI systems face severe engineering impediments, primarily characterized by poor cross-scenario adaptability, rigid inter-module coupling, and fragmented inference acceleration. To overcome these limitations, we propose RoboNeuron, a universal deployment framework for embodied intelligence. RoboNeuron is the first framework to deeply integrate the cognitive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models with the real-time execution backbone of the Robot Operating System (ROS). We utilize the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a semantic bridge, enabling the LLM to dynamically orchestrate underlying robotic tools. The framework establishes a highly modular architecture that strictly decouples sensing, reasoning, and control by leveraging ROS's unified communication interfaces. Crucially, we introduce an automated tool to translate ROS messages into callable MCP functions, significantly streamlining development. RoboNeuron significantly enhances cross-scenario adaptability and component flexibility, while establishing a systematic platform for horizontal performance benchmarking, laying a robust foundation for scalable real-world embodied applications.

Abstract: Accurate and continuous pedestrian positioning across outdoor-indoor environments remains challenging because GNSS, UWB, and inertial PDR are complementary yet individually fragile under signal blockage, multipath, and drift. This paper presents a unified GNSS/UWB/IMU fusion framework for seamless pedestrian localization and provides a controlled comparison of three probabilistic back-ends: an error-state extended Kalman filter, sliding-window factor graph optimization, and a particle filter. The system uses chest-mounted IMU-based PDR as the motion backbone and integrates absolute updates from GNSS outdoors and UWB indoors. To enhance transition robustness and mitigate urban GNSS degradation, we introduce a lightweight map-based feasibility constraint derived from OpenStreetMap building footprints, treating most building interiors as non-navigable while allowing motion inside a designated UWB-instrumented building. The framework is implemented in ROS 2 and runs in real time on a wearable platform, with visualization in Foxglove. We evaluate three scenarios: indoor (UWB+PDR), outdoor (GNSS+PDR), and seamless outdoor-indoor (GNSS+UWB+PDR). Results show that the ESKF provides the most consistent overall performance in our implementation.

Abstract: Contact-rich manipulation is difficult for robots to execute and requires accurate perception of the environment. In some scenarios, vision is occluded. The robot can then no longer obtain real-time scene state information through visual feedback. This is called ``blind manipulation". In this manuscript, a novel physically-driven contact cognition method, called ``Contact SLAM", is proposed. It estimates the state of the environment and achieves manipulation using only tactile sensing and prior knowledge of the scene. To maximize exploration efficiency, this manuscript also designs an active exploration policy. The policy gradually reduces uncertainties in the manipulation scene. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method in several contact-rich tasks, including the difficult and delicate socket assembly task and block-pushing task.

Abstract: Ultra-wideband (UWB) has shown promising potential in GPS-denied localization thanks to its lightweight and drift-free characteristics, while the accuracy is limited in real scenarios due to its sensitivity to sensor arrangement and non-Gaussian pattern induced by multi-path or multi-signal interference, which commonly occurs in many typical applications like long tunnels. We introduce a novel neural fusion framework for ranging inertial odometry which involves a graph attention UWB network and a recurrent neural inertial network. Our graph net learns scene-relevant ranging patterns and adapts to any number of anchors or tags, realizing accurate positioning without calibration. Additionally, the integration of least squares and the incorporation of nominal frame enhance overall performance and scalability. The effectiveness and robustness of our methods are validated through extensive experiments on both public and self-collected datasets, spanning indoor, outdoor, and tunnel environments. The results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed IR-ULSG in handling challenging conditions, including scenarios outside the convex envelope and cases where only a single anchor is available.

Abstract: Ultra-wideband (UWB)-vision fusion localization has achieved extensive applications in the domain of multi-agent relative localization. The challenging matching problem between robots and visual detection renders existing methods highly dependent on identity-encoded hardware or delicate tuning algorithms. Overconfident yet erroneous matches may bring about irreversible damage to the localization system. To address this issue, we introduce Mr. Virgil, an end-to-end learning multi-robot visual-range relative localization framework, consisting of a graph neural network for data association between UWB rangings and visual detections, and a differentiable pose graph optimization (PGO) back-end. The graph-based front-end supplies robust matching results, accurate initial position predictions, and credible uncertainty estimates, which are subsequently integrated into the PGO back-end to elevate the accuracy of the final pose estimation. Additionally, a decentralized system is implemented for real-world applications. Experiments spanning varying robot numbers, simulation and real-world, occlusion and non-occlusion conditions showcase the stability and exactitude under various scenes compared to conventional methods.

Abstract: Most skydiving accidents occur during the parafoil-piloting and landing stages and result from human lapses in judgment while piloting the parafoil. Training of novice pilots is protracted due to the lack of functional and easily accessible training simulators. Moreover, work on parafoil trajectory planning suitable for aiding human training remains limited. To bridge this gap, we study the problem of computing safe trajectories for human-piloted parafoil flight and examine how such trajectories fare against human-generated solutions. For the algorithmic part, we adapt the sampling-based motion planner Stable Sparse RRT (SST) by Li et al., to cope with the problem constraints while minimizing the bank angle (control effort) as a proxy for safety. We then compare the computer-generated solutions with data from human-generated parafoil flight, where the algorithm offers a relative cost improvement of 20\%-80\% over the performance of the human pilot. We observe that human pilots tend to, first, close the horizontal distance to the landing area, and then address the vertical gap by spiraling down to the suitable altitude for starting a landing maneuver. The algorithm considered here makes smoother and more gradual descents, arriving at the landing area at the precise altitude necessary for the final approach while maintaining safety constraints. Overall, the study demonstrates the potential of computer-generated guidelines, rather than traditional rules of thumb, which can be integrated into future simulators to train pilots for safer and more cost-effective flights.

Abstract: We propose LEO-RobotAgent, a general-purpose language-driven intelligent agent framework for robots. Under this framework, LLMs can operate different types of robots to complete unpredictable complex tasks across various scenarios. This framework features strong generalization, robustness, and efficiency. The application-level system built around it can fully enhance bidirectional human-robot intent understanding and lower the threshold for human-robot interaction. Regarding robot task planning, the vast majority of existing studies focus on the application of large models in single-task scenarios and for single robot types. These algorithms often have complex structures and lack generalizability. Thus, the proposed LEO-RobotAgent framework is designed with a streamlined structure as much as possible, enabling large models to independently think, plan, and act within this clear framework. We provide a modular and easily registrable toolset, allowing large models to flexibly call various tools to meet different requirements. Meanwhile, the framework incorporates a human-robot interaction mechanism, enabling the algorithm to collaborate with humans like a partner. Experiments have verified that this framework can be easily adapted to mainstream robot platforms including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), robotic arms, and wheeled robot, and efficiently execute a variety of carefully designed tasks with different complexity levels.

Abstract: Generative world models hold significant potential for simulating interactions with visuomotor policies in varied environments. Frontier video models can enable generation of realistic observations and environment interactions in a scalable and general manner. However, the use of video models in robotics has been limited primarily to in-distribution evaluations, i.e., scenarios that are similar to ones used to train the policy or fine-tune the base video model. In this report, we demonstrate that video models can be used for the entire spectrum of policy evaluation use cases in robotics: from assessing nominal performance to out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and probing physical and semantic safety. We introduce a generative evaluation system built upon a frontier video foundation model (Veo). The system is optimized to support robot action conditioning and multi-view consistency, while integrating generative image-editing and multi-view completion to synthesize realistic variations of real-world scenes along multiple axes of generalization. We demonstrate that the system preserves the base capabilities of the video model to enable accurate simulation of scenes that have been edited to include novel interaction objects, novel visual backgrounds, and novel distractor objects. This fidelity enables accurately predicting the relative performance of different policies in both nominal and OOD conditions, determining the relative impact of different axes of generalization on policy performance, and performing red teaming of policies to expose behaviors that violate physical or semantic safety constraints. We validate these capabilities through 1600+ real-world evaluations of eight Gemini Robotics policy checkpoints and five tasks for a bimanual manipulator.

Abstract: Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to enhance driving safety, for example by enabling safe vehicle following and more efficient traffic scheduling. For such future deployments, safety requirements should be addressed, where the primary such are avoidance of vehicle collisions and substantial mitigating of harm when collisions are unavoidable. However, conservative worst-case-based control strategies come at the price of reduced flexibility and may compromise overall performance. In light of this, we investigate how Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can be leveraged to improve safety in multi-vehicle-following scenarios involving emergency braking. Specifically, we investigate how DRL with vehicle-to-vehicle communication can be used to ethically select an emergency breaking profile in scenarios where overall, or collective, three-vehicle harm reduction or collision avoidance shall be obtained instead of single-vehicle such. As an algorithm, we provide a hybrid approach that combines DRL with a previously published method based on analytical expressions for selecting optimal constant deceleration. By combining DRL with the previous method, the proposed hybrid approach increases the reliability compared to standalone DRL, while achieving superior performance in terms of overall harm reduction and collision avoidance.

Then we design a continuous feedback law that guarantees convergence to, and sufficient sweeping of the curve, followed by convergence to the desired formation vertices while ensuring inter-agent avoidance. The proposed approach is validated through numerical simulations for different classes of curves and different rigid formations. Code: https://github.com/mebbaid/paper-elobaid-ifacwc-2026

Abstract: Aerial manipulators undergo rapid, configuration-dependent changes in inertial coupling forces and aerodynamic forces, making accurate dynamics modeling a core challenge for reliable control. Analytical models lose fidelity under these nonlinear and nonstationary effects, while standard data-driven methods such as deep neural networks and Gaussian processes cannot represent the diverse residual behaviors that arise across different operating conditions. We propose a regime-conditioned diffusion framework that models the full distribution of residual forces using a conditional diffusion process and a lightweight temporal encoder. The encoder extracts a compact summary of recent motion and configuration, enabling consistent residual predictions even through abrupt transitions or unseen payloads. When combined with an adaptive controller, the framework enables dynamics uncertainty compensation and yields markedly improved tracking accuracy in real-world tests.

Abstract: Collecting robotic manipulation data is expensive, making it impractical to acquire demonstrations for the combinatorially large space of tasks that arise in multi-object, multi-robot, and multi-environment settings. While recent generative models can synthesize useful data for individual tasks, they do not exploit the compositional structure of robotic domains and struggle to generalize to unseen task combinations. We propose a semantic compositional diffusion transformer that factorizes transitions into robot-, object-, obstacle-, and objective-specific components and learns their interactions through attention. Once trained on a limited subset of tasks, we show that our model can zero-shot generate high-quality transitions from which we can learn control policies for unseen task combinations. Then, we introduce an iterative self-improvement procedure in which synthetic data is validated via offline reinforcement learning and incorporated into subsequent training rounds. Our approach substantially improves zero-shot performance over monolithic and hard-coded compositional baselines, ultimately solving nearly all held-out tasks and demonstrating the emergence of meaningful compositional structure in the learned representations.

Abstract: Autonomous drone navigation in confined tubular environments remains a major challenge due to the constraining geometry of the conduits, the proximity of the walls, and the perceptual limitations inherent to such scenarios. We propose a reinforcement learning approach enabling a drone to navigate unknown three-dimensional tubes without any prior knowledge of their geometry, relying solely on local observations from LiDAR and a conditional visual detection of the tube center. In contrast, the Pure Pursuit algorithm, used as a deterministic baseline, benefits from explicit access to the centerline, creating an information asymmetry designed to assess the ability of RL to compensate for the absence of a geometric model. The agent is trained through a progressive Curriculum Learning strategy that gradually exposes it to increasingly curved geometries, where the tube center frequently disappears from the visual field. A turning-negotiation mechanism, based on the combination of direct visibility, directional memory, and LiDAR symmetry cues, proves essential for ensuring stable navigation under such partial observability conditions. Experiments show that the PPO policy acquires robust and generalizable behavior, consistently outperforming the deterministic controller despite its limited access to geometric information. Validation in a high-fidelity 3D environment further confirms the transferability of the learned behavior to a continuous physical dynamics.
  The proposed approach thus provides a complete framework for autonomous navigation in unknown tubular environments and opens perspectives for industrial, underground, or medical applications where progressing through narrow and weakly perceptive conduits represents a central challenge.

Abstract: Human-level contact-rich manipulation relies on the distinct roles of two key modalities: vision provides spatially rich but temporally slow global context, while force sensing captures rapid, high-frequency local contact dynamics. Integrating these signals is challenging due to their fundamental frequency and informational disparities. In this work, we propose ImplicitRDP, a unified end-to-end visual-force diffusion policy that integrates visual planning and reactive force control within a single network. We introduce Structural Slow-Fast Learning, a mechanism utilizing causal attention to simultaneously process asynchronous visual and force tokens, allowing the policy to perform closed-loop adjustments at the force frequency while maintaining the temporal coherence of action chunks. Furthermore, to mitigate modality collapse where end-to-end models fail to adjust the weights across different modalities, we propose Virtual-target-based Representation Regularization. This auxiliary objective maps force feedback into the same space as the action, providing a stronger, physics-grounded learning signal than raw force prediction. Extensive experiments on contact-rich tasks demonstrate that ImplicitRDP significantly outperforms both vision-only and hierarchical baselines, achieving superior reactivity and success rates with a streamlined training pipeline. Code and videos will be publicly available at https://implicit-rdp.github.io.

Abstract: Hirschberg's algorithm (1975) reduces the space complexity for the longest common subsequence problem from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$ via recursive midpoint bisection on a grid dynamic program (DP). We show that the underlying idea generalizes to a broad class of dynamic programs with local dependencies on directed acyclic graphs (DP DAGs). Modeling a DP as deterministic time evolution over a topologically ordered DAG with frontier width $ω$ and bounded in-degree, and assuming a max-type semiring with deterministic tie breaking, we prove that in a standard offline random-access model any such DP admits deterministic traceback in space $O(ω\log T + (\log T)^{O(1)})$ cells over a fixed finite alphabet, where $T$ is the number of states. Our construction replaces backward dynamic programs by forward-only recomputation and organizes the time order into a height-compressed recursion tree whose nodes expose small "middle frontiers'' across which every optimal path must pass. The framework yields near-optimal traceback bounds for asymmetric and banded sequence alignment, one-dimensional recurrences, and dynamic-programming formulations on graphs of bounded pathwidth. We also show that an $Ω(ω)$ space term (in bits) is unavoidable in forward single-pass models and discuss conjectured $\sqrt{T}$-type barriers in streaming settings, supporting the view that space-efficient traceback is a structural property of width-bounded DP DAGs rather than a peculiarity of grid-based algorithms.

We obtain fully polynomial-time approximation schemes for both the probability of intersection and the dimension of intersection for commuting projectors. For general projectors, we provide two algorithms: a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme under a global inclusion-exclusion stability condition, and an efficient affine approximation under a spectral gap assumption. As corollaries of our results, we obtain efficient algorithms for approximating the number of satisfying assignments of conjunctive normal form formulae and the dimension of satisfying subspaces of quantum satisfiability formulae.

Abstract: A $k$-defective clique is a relaxation of the traditional clique definition, allowing up to $k$ missing edges. This relaxation is crucial in various real-world applications such as link prediction, community detection, and social network analysis. Although the problems of enumerating maximal $k$-defective cliques and searching a maximum $k$-defective clique have been extensively studied, existing algorithms suffer from limitations such as the combinatorial explosion of small partial solutions and sub-optimal search spaces. To address these limitations, we propose a novel clique-first branch-and-bound framework that first generates cliques and then adds missing edges. Furthermore, we introduce a new pivoting technique that achieves a search space size of $\mathcal{O}(3^{\frac{n}{3}} \cdot n^k)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the input graph. We prove that the worst-case number of maximal $k$-defective cliques is $Ω(3^{\frac{n}{3}} \cdot n^k)$ when $k$ is a constant, establishing that our algorithm's search space is worst-case optimal. Leveraging the diameter-two property of defective cliques, we further reduce the search space size to $\mathcal{O}(n \cdot 3^{\fracδ{3}} \cdot (δΔ)^k)$, where $δ$ is the degeneracy and $Δ$ is the maximum degree of the input graph. We also propose an efficient framework for maximum $k$-defective clique search based on our branch-and-bound, together with practical techniques to reduce the search space. Experiments on real-world benchmark datasets with more than 1 million edges demonstrate that each of our proposed algorithms for maximal $k$-defective clique enumeration and maximum $k$-defective clique search outperforms the respective state-of-the-art algorithms by up to four orders of magnitude in terms of processing time.

Abstract: We study the one-way two-party communication complexity of Maximum Matching in the semi-robust setting where the edges of a maximum matching are randomly partitioned between Alice and Bob, but all remaining edges of the input graph are adversarially partitioned between the two parties.
  We show that the simple protocol where Alice solely communicates a lexicographically-first maximum matching of their edges to Bob is surprisingly powerful: We prove that it yields a $3/4$-approximation in expectation and that our analysis is tight.
  The semi-robust setting is at least as hard as the fully robust setting. In this setting, all edges of the input graph are randomly partitioned between Alice and Bob, and the state-of-the-art result is a fairly involved $5/6$-approximation protocol that is based on the computation of edge-degree constrained subgraphs [Azarmehr, Behnezhad, ICALP'23]. Our protocol also immediately yields a $3/4$-approximation in the fully robust setting. One may wonder whether an improved analysis of our protocol in the fully robust setting is possible: While we cannot rule this out, we give an instance where our protocol only achieves a $0.832 < 5/6 = 0.83$-approximation. Hence, while our simple protocol performs surprisingly well, it cannot be used to improve over the state-of-the-art in the fully robust setting.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reinsurance decision-making exhibits the core structural properties that motivate multi-agent models: distributed and asymmetric information, partial observability, heterogeneous epistemic responsibilities, simulator-driven environment dynamics, and binding prudential and regulatory constraints. Deterministic workflow automation cannot meet these requirements, as it lacks the epistemic flexibility, cooperative coordination mechanisms, and norm-sensitive behaviour required for institutional risk-transfer.
  We propose the Reinsurance Constrained Multi-Agent Simulation Process (R-CMASP), a formal model that extends stochastic games and Dec-POMDPs by adding three missing elements: (i) simulator-coupled transition dynamics grounded in catastrophe, capital, and portfolio engines; (ii) role-specialized agents with structured observability, belief updates, and typed communication; and (iii) a normative feasibility layer encoding solvency, regulatory, and organizational rules as admissibility constraints on joint actions.
  Using LLM-based agents with tool access and typed message protocols, we show in a domain-calibrated synthetic environment that governed multi-agent coordination yields more stable, coherent, and norm-adherent behaviour than deterministic automation or monolithic LLM baselines--reducing pricing variance, improving capital efficiency, and increasing clause-interpretation accuracy. Embedding prudential norms as admissibility constraints and structuring communication into typed acts measurably enhances equilibrium stability.
  Overall, the results suggest that regulated, simulator-driven decision environments are most naturally modelled as norm-governed, simulator-coupled multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is the problem of finding collision-free paths for a team of agents on a map. Although MAPF is NP-hard, the hardness of solving individual instances varies significantly, revealing a gap between theoretical complexity and actual hardness. This paper outlines three key research challenges in MAPF empirical hardness to understand such phenomena. The first challenge, known as algorithm selection, is determining the best-performing algorithms for a given instance. The second challenge is understanding the key instance features that affect MAPF empirical hardness, such as structural properties like phase transition and backbone/backdoor. The third challenge is how to leverage our knowledge of MAPF empirical hardness to effectively generate hard MAPF instances or diverse benchmark datasets. This work establishes a foundation for future empirical hardness research and encourages deeper investigation into these promising and underexplored areas.

Abstract: We demonstrate how collective memory emerges in decentralized multi-agent systems through the interplay between individual agent memory and environmental trace communication. Our agents maintain internal memory states while depositing persistent environmental traces, creating a spatially distributed collective memory without centralized control. Comprehensive validation across five environmental conditions (20x20 to 50x50 grids, 5-20 agents, 50 runs per configuration) reveals a critical asymmetry: individual memory alone provides 68.7% performance improvement over no-memory baselines (1563.87 vs 927.23, p < 0.001), while environmental traces without memory fail completely. This demonstrates that memory functions independently but traces require cognitive infrastructure for interpretation. Systematic density-sweep experiments (rho in [0.049, 0.300], up to 625 agents) validate our theoretical phase transition prediction. On realistic large grids (30x30, 50x50), stigmergic coordination dominates above rho ~ 0.20, with traces outperforming memory by 36-41% on composite metrics despite lower food efficiency. The experimental crossover confirms the predicted critical density rho_c = 0.230 within 13% error.

Abstract: We present Thinking While Driving, a concurrent routing framework that integrates LLMs into a graph-based traffic environment. Unlike approaches that require agents to stop and deliberate, our system enables LLM-based route planning while agents are moving, significantly reducing intersection wait times. Under high traffic, agents average just 0.75 seconds of decision latency. To coordinate many agents in real-time, we implement a non-blocking asynchronous architecture using Unity coroutines and a dedicated request manager. The environment is a weighted undirected graph with live congestion metrics, updated continuously by the agents to enable shared perception. Our results show LLM-driven agents can dynamically adapt to traffic, reroute around congestion, and exhibit behaviors beyond static pathfinding, all while maintaining real-time performance. This work provides a reproducible framework for future research in adaptive routing and multi-agent cooperation.

Abstract: We study distributionally robust Markov games (DR-MGs) with the average-reward criterion, a framework for multi-agent decision-making under uncertainty over extended horizons. In average reward DR-MGs, agents aim to maximize their worst-case infinite-horizon average reward, to ensure satisfactory performance under environment uncertainties and opponent actions. We first establish a connection between the best-response policies and the optimal policies for the induced single-agent problems. Under a standard irreducible assumption, we derive a correspondence between the optimal policies and the solutions of the robust Bellman equation, and derive the existence of stationary Nash Equilibrium (NE) based on these results. We further study DR-MGs under the weakly communicating setting, where we construct a set-valued map and show its value is a subset of the best-response policies, convex and upper hemi-continuous, and derive the existence of NE. We then explore algorithmic solutions, by first proposing a Robust Nash-Iteration algorithm and providing convergence guarantees under some additional assumptions and a NE computing oracle. We further develop a temporal-difference based algorithm for DR-MGs, and provide convergence guarantees without any additional oracle or assumptions. Finally, we connect average-reward robust NE to discounted ones, showing that the average reward robust NE can be approximated by the discounted ones under a large discount factor. Our studies provide a comprehensive theoretical and algorithmic foundation for decision-making in complex, uncertain, and long-running multi-player environments.

Abstract: Quantum resource theories (QRTs) provide a unified framework for characterizing useful quantum phenomena subject to physical constraints, but are notoriously hard to assess in experimental systems. In this letter, we introduce a unified protocol for quantifying the resource-generating power (RGP) of arbitrary quantum evolutions applicable to multiple QRTs. It is based on deep thermalization (DT), which has recently gained attention for its role in the emergence of quantum state designs from partial projective measurements. Central to our approach is the use of projected ensembles, recently employed to probe DT, together with new twirling identities that allow us to directly infer the RGP of the underlying dynamics. These identities further reveal how resources build up and thermalize in generic quantum circuits. Finally, we show that quantum resources themselves undergo deep thermalization at the subsystem level, offering a complementary and another experimentally accessible route to infer the RGP. Our work connects deep thermalization to resource quantification, offering a new perspective on the essential role of various resources in generating state designs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We develop a bottom-up, statistics-first framework in which the full probabilistic content of an operational theory is encoded in its matrix of conditional outcome probabilities of events (COPE). Within this setting, five model classes (preGPTs, GPTs, quasiprobabilistic, ontological, and noncontextual ontological) are unified as constrained factorizations of the COPE matrix. We identify equirank factorizations as the structural core of GPTs and noncontextual ontological models and establish their relation to tomographic completeness. This yields a simple, model-agnostic criterion for noncontextuality: an operational theory admits a noncontextual ontological model if and only if its COPE matrix admits an equirank nonnegative matrix factorization (ENMF). Failure of the equirank condition in all ontological models therefore establishes contextuality. We operationalize rank separation via two complementary methods provided by the linear-algebraic framework. First, we use ENMF to interpret noncontextual ontological models as nested polytopes. This allows us to establish that the boxworld operational theory is ontologically contextual. Second, we apply techniques from discrete mathematics to derive a lower bound on the ontological dimensionality of COPE matrices exhibiting sparsity patterns, and use this bound to establish a new proof that a discrete version of qubit theory exhibits ontological contextuality. By reframing contextuality as a problem in matrix analysis, our work provides a unified structure for its systematic study and opens new avenues for exploring nonclassical resources.

Abstract: We introduce a framework for scalable and broadband free-space phase-matched four-wave mixing in ring resonators. This method for four-wave mixing reduces the complexity of coupling an emitter to a quantum network by combining the spatial and spectral interfaces between them into one nonlinear optical process. The device is compliant with current heterogeneous integration capabilities and has a bandwidth of 165 nm for efficient spatio-spectral conversion. We outline a fabrication-ready diamond-on-insulator pathway towards modular unit cells that natively bridge visible color centers to the infrared spectrum for scalable quantum networks. We also present and analyze an end-to-end framework for considering single-photon coupling efficiency from a color center to a quantum network. This framework represents a step forwards in analyzing and reducing system-scale losses in a spin-photon interface.

Abstract: Quantum theory departs from classical probabilistic theories in foundational ways. These departures--termed quantumness here--power quantum information and computation. This thesis charts the role of discrete structures in assessing quantumness, synthesizing elements of my postdoctoral research through this lens. After an introduction to the necessary background concepts, I present my work under three broad categories. First, I present work on contextuality that extensively relies on (undirected) graphs and hypergraphs as the discrete structures of interest; more specifically, it relies on invariants associated with them. This work includes Kochen-Specker (KS) contextuality and its operationalization to generalized contextuality, expressed via (hyper)graph-theoretic frameworks. I also present work on KS-contextuality in multiqubit systems and an application of generalized contextuality to a one-shot communication task, both of which rely on hypergraphs. Second, I present work on causality, where the discrete structures of interest are directed graphs. This includes work on indefinite causal order, specifically its connections to the gap between local operations and classical communication (LOCC) and separable operations (SEP), and a device-independent notion of nonclassicality--termed antinomicity--that generalizes Bell nonlocality without global causal assumptions. Finally, I present work on the incompatibility of quantum measurements, its connection to Bell nonlocality, and its role in discriminating between quantum and almost quantum correlations in the single-system setting. The discrete structures of interest here are hypergraphs that model joint measurability relations between quantum measurements. I conclude with a summary and an overview of work that is not covered in this thesis.

Abstract: Quantum process tomography, the task of estimating an unknown quantum channel, is a central problem in quantum information theory and a key primitive for characterising noisy quantum devices. A long-standing open question is to determine the optimal number of uses of an unknown channel required to learn it in diamond distance, the standard measure of worst-case distinguishability between quantum processes. Here we show that a quantum channel acting on a $d$-dimensional system can be estimated to accuracy $\varepsilon$ in diamond distance using $O(d^4/\varepsilon^2)$ channel uses. This scaling is essentially optimal, as it matches lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. Our analysis extends to channels with input and output dimensions $d_{\mathrm{in}}$ and $d_{\mathrm{out}}$ and Kraus rank at most $k$, for which $O(d_{\mathrm{in}} d_{\mathrm{out}} k/\varepsilon^2)$ channel uses suffice, interpolating between unitary and fully generic channels. As by-products, we obtain, to the best of our knowledge, the first essentially optimal strategies for operator-norm learning of binary POVMs and isometries, and we recover optimal trace-distance tomography for fixed-rank states. Our approach consists of using the channel only non-adaptively to prepare copies of the Choi state, purify them in parallel, perform sample-optimal pure-state tomography on the purifications, and analyse the resulting estimator directly in diamond distance via its semidefinite-program characterisation. While the sample complexity of state tomography in trace distance is by now well understood, our results finally settle the corresponding problem for quantum channels in diamond distance.

Abstract: The optomagnonic coupling between magnons and optical photons is an essential component for building remote quantum networks based on magnonics. Here we show that such a coupling, manifested as the magnon-induced Brillouin light scattering, can be exploited to entangle two propagating optical fields. The protocol employs two pairs of the whispering gallery modes coupled to the same magnon mode in a YIG sphere. In each pair a strong pump field is applied to activate either Stokes or anti-Stokes scattering. Due to the magnon mode involving in the two scattering processes and as a mediation, Stokes and anti-Stokes photons of different polarizations get entangled. The entanglement can be extracted by filtering the travelling output fields centered at the Stokes and anti-Stokes sidebands. Optimal conditions are identified under which strong output entanglement can be achieved.

Abstract: We develop a novel framework to engineer persistent oscillatory modes in Markovian open quantum systems governed by a time-independent Lindblad master equation. We show that oscillatory modes can be created when the Hamiltonian and jump operator can be expressed in the same block-diagonal form. A key feature of the framework is that the dissipator of the Lindblad master equation are generally non-zero. We identify the weak and strong conditions, where the onset of the oscillatory modes is dependent and independent of the parameters of the system, respectively. Our method extends beyond the typical decoherence-free subspace approach, in which the dissipator is zero. We demonstrate the applicability of this framework using various models, showing how carefully tailored system-environment interactions can produce sustained coherent oscillations.

Abstract: Finite drive power leaves unavoidable spatial gradients in control fields, preventing spin ensembles from reaching the standard-quantum-limit sensitivity.

Applied to both pulsed and continuous-wave magnetometry, the optimal subsets deliver up to a tenfold improvement over conventional schemes relying on nominally uniform regions of the ensembles. We demonstrate phase-only digital holography to implement the optimal subsets and show that residual aberrations add less than 1 dB of sensitivity loss. Our framework imposes no fundamental trade-offs and extends quantum sensing to heterogeneous sensing environments.

Abstract: The upper bounds for the rate of fluctuation growth of an observable in both open and closed quantum systems have been studied actively recently. In our recent work we showed that the rate of fluctuation growth for an observable in a closed quantum system is upper bounded by the fluctuation of its corresponding velocity-like observable. That bound also indicated a tradeoff between the time derivatives of the mean and the standard deviation. In this paper we will look at open quantum systems in two cases. For the first case we find the generator of evolution for an open system employing both the Taylor expansion and the standard time-ordered evolution via the Dyson series, while in the second case we consider no specific information about the evolution of the system. We then find the rate of fluctuation growth in each case. Comparing the upper bounds for each case and considering the upper bound found for a closed system suggest that including more details by separating the contributions of the system and state dynamics seems to result in looser bounds for the rate of fluctuation growth.

Abstract: Silicon spin qubits are a promising candidate for quantum computing, thanks to their high coherence, high controllability and manufacturability. However, the most scalable complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) based implementations have so far been limited to a few qubits. Here, to take a step towards large scale systems, we tune and coherently control an eight-dot linear array of silicon spin qubits fabricated in 300 mm CMOS-compatible foundry process, establishing operational scalability beyond the two-qubit regime. All eight qubits are successfully tuned and characterized as four double dot pairs, exhibiting Ramsey dephasing times $T_2^*$ up to 41(2) $μ$s and Hahn-echo coherence times $T_2^{\mathrm{Hahn}}$ up to 1.31(4) ms. Readout of the central four qubits is achieved via a cascaded charge-sensing protocol, enabling simultaneous high-fidelity measurements of the entire multi-qubit array. Additionally, we demonstrate a two-qubit gate operation between adjacent qubits with low phase noise. We demonstrate here that we can scale silicon spin qubit arrays to medium-sized arrays of 8 qubits while maintaining coherence of the system.

Abstract: A critical aspect of next-generation wireless networks is the integration of quantum communications to guard against quantum computing threats to classical networks. Despite successful experimental demonstrations, integrating quantum communications into the classical infrastructure faces substantial challenges, including high costs, compatibility issues, and extra hardware deployment to accommodate both classical and quantum communication equipment. To mitigate these challenges, we explore novel protocols that enable simultaneous classical and quantum communications, relying on a single set of transceivers to jointly modulate and decode classical and quantum information onto the same signal. Additionally, we emphasize extending quantum communication capabilities beyond traditional optical bands into the terahertz, even possibly to millimeter-wave and microwave frequencies, thereby broadening the potential horizon of quantum-secure applications. Finally, we identify open problems that must be addressed to facilitate practical implementation.

Abstract: Light-injection attacks pose critical security threats to quantum key distribution (QKD) systems. Conventional defense methods, such as isolators, filters, and optical power monitoring, are confronted with the threats of specific attacks and the limitations in integration. To address this, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an integrated attack sensing and automatic response unit utilizing the photorefractive effect in a thin-film lithium niobate microring resonator. Our unit provides a high rejection ratio against non-resonant injected light. For resonant attacks exceeding tens of microwatts, the unit can autonomously attenuate the transmission of the quantum signal light, leading to a significant suppression of the secret key rate. This work enhances the security of QKD systems against light-injection attacks by providing a highly sensitive, broadband, and on-chip defense mechanism.

Abstract: Quantum uncertainty is deeply linked to quantum correlations and relativistic motion. The entropic uncertainty relation with quantum memory offers a powerful way to study how shared entanglement affects measurement precision. However, under acceleration, the Unruh effect can degrade quantum correlations, raising questions about the reliability of QMA-EUR in such settings. Here, we investigate the QMA-EUR for two uniformly accelerating Unruh-DeWitt detectors coupled to a massless scalar field. Using the Kossakowski-Lindblad master equation, we calculate the entropic uncertainty, its lower bound, and the tightness of the relation under different Unruh temperatures. We find that acceleration does not always increase the lower bound on the uncertainty relation. Depending on the initial correlations between the detectors, it may either increase or decrease. This behavior results from the interplay between quantum discord and minimal missing information. Interestingly, a higher quantum discord does not necessarily lead to lower uncertainty.

Abstract: We propose a novel scheme for generating mechanical squeezed states based on the combined mechanism of a two-tone driving and a squeezed vacuum field. This innovative approach achieves a remarkable improvement in mechanical squeezing performance across the entire range of red/blue detuning ratios. Our study reveals that the squeezed vacuum field not only induces position squeezing of the mechanical oscillator but also facilitates momentum squeezing through phase matching. Moreover, the total squeezing degree exhibits nonlinear enhancement with the increasing of squeezing parameter $r$. The mechanical squeezed state exhibits a $2π$-periodic dependence in relation to the squeezing phase $θ$, offering experimental implementation with a high degree of operational flexibility. Notably, the scheme exhibits strong robustness against cavity dissipation and environmental thermal noise, substantially relaxing the strict parameter-matching requirements inherent in conventional approaches.

Abstract: Entangled coherent states (ECS) provide a powerful non-Gaussian resource for continuous-variable quantum communication, but their generation in scalable architectures remains challenging. We propose an integrated photonic scheme that creates high-fidelity ECS from a two-mode squeezed vacuum via photon subtraction in a symmetric waveguide trimer. The resulting non-Gaussian entanglement is further enhanced by single-photon catalysis, which purifies the distributed state after transmission through lossy channels. Using these purified ECS resources, we analyze a photon-number-based teleportation protocol and demonstrate high-fidelity transfer of both coherent states and Schrodinger cat states. In particular, the teleportation fidelity for cat states exceeds the classical threshold of 2/3 over a broad range of realistic channel and squeezing parameters, whereas Gaussian resources fail to do so. Our results show that integrated photon subtraction and catalysis enable practical, chip-compatible generation of non-Gaussian entanglement suitable for advanced quantum teleportation and continuous-variable quantum networks.

Abstract: We introduce a simple protocol for measuring properties of a gapped ground state with essentially no disturbance to the state. The required Hamiltonian evolution time scales inversely with the spectral gap and target precision (up to logarithmic factors), which is optimal. For local observables on geometrically local systems, the protocol only requires Hamiltonian evolution on a quasi-local patch of inverse-gap radius. Our results show that gapped ground states are algorithmically readable from a single copy without a recovery or rewinding procedure, which may drastically reduce tomography overhead in certain quantum simulation tasks.

Abstract: The investigation of biomolecular interactions at the single-molecule level has emerged as a pivotal research area in life science, particularly through optical, mechanical, and electrochemical approaches. Spins existing widely in biological systems, offer a unique degree of freedom for detecting such interactions. However, most previous studies have been largely confined to ensemble-level detection in the spin degree. Here, we developed a molecular interaction analysis method approaching single-molecule level based on relaxometry using the quantum sensor, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Experiments utilized an optimized diamond surface functionalized with a polyethylenimine nanogel layer, achieving $\sim$10 nm average protein distance and mitigating interfacial steric hindrance. Then we measured the strong interaction between streptavidin and spin-labeled biotin complexes, as well as the weak interaction between bovine serum albumin and biotin complexes, at both the micrometer scale and nanoscale. For the micrometer-scale measurements using ensemble NV centers, we re-examined the often-neglected fast relaxation component and proposed a relaxation rate evaluation method, substantially enhancing the measurement sensitivity. Furthermore, we achieved nanoscale detection approaching single-molecule level using single NV centers. This methodology holds promise for applications in molecular screening, identification and kinetic studies at the single-molecule level, offering critical insights into molecular function and activity mechanisms.

Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) at the single-molecule level with atomic resolution holds transformative potential for structural biology and surface chemistry. Near-surface solid-state spin sensors with optical readout ability offer a promising pathway toward this goal. However, their extreme proximity to target molecules demands exceptional robustness against surface-induced perturbations. Furthermore, life science applications require these sensors to operate in biocompatible spectral ranges that minimize photodamage. In this work, we demonstrate that the PL6 quantum defect in 4H silicon carbide (4H-SiC) can serve as a robust near-infrared spin sensor. This sensor operates at tissue-transparent wavelengths and exhibits exceptional near-surface stability even at depth of 2 nm. Using shallow PL6 centers, we achieve nanoscale NMR detection of proton ($\mathrm{^{1}H}$) spins in immersion oil and fluorine ($\mathrm{^{19}F}$) spins in Fomblin, attaining a detection volume of $\mathrm{(3~nm)^3}$ and a sensitivity reaching the requirement for single-proton spin detection. This work establishes 4H-SiC quantum sensors as a compelling platform for nanoscale magnetic resonance, with promising applications in probing low-dimensional water phases, protein folding dynamics, and molecular interactions.

Abstract: We propose an optomagnomechanical approach for preparing a cat-like superposition state of mechanical motion. Our protocol consists of two steps and is based on the magnomechanical system where the magnetostrictively induced displacement further couples to an optical cavity mode via radiation pressure. We first prepare a squeezed mechanical state by driving the magnomechanical system with a two-tone microwave field. We then switch off the microwave drives and send a weak red-detuned optical pulse to the optical cavity to weakly activate the optomechanical anti-Stokes scattering. We show that $k$ phonons can be subtracted from the prepared squeezed state, conditioned on the detection of $k$ anti-Stokes photons from the cavity output field, which prepares the mechanical motion in a cat-like state. The work provides a new avenue for preparing mechanical superposition states by combining opto- and magnomechanics and may find applications in the study of macroscopic quantum states and the test of collapse theories.

Abstract: The search for exotic temporal orders in quantum matter, such as discrete quasi-time crystals (DQTCs), has become an important theme in nonequilibrium physics. However, realizing these phases has so far required complex protocols, such as drives with multiple incommensurate frequencies. Here, we present a significantly simpler mechanism: the emergence of DQTCs in a dissipative collective spin system subjected to only a single periodic drive. Remarkably, the characteristic frequencies of this novel phase are not fixed but can be continuously tuned by varying the strength of the drive. Even more strikingly, this tunability is punctuated by Arnold tongues, within which the response main frequency locks to rational fractions of the drive. Our model further provides a unified framework that also encompasses stationary, discrete time crystals and chaotic phases. This discovery simplifies the requirements for generating complex temporal orders and opens a viable route towards the experimental control and manipulation of quasi-time crystalline matter.

Abstract: Adiabatic quantum computing is a powerful framework for state preparation, while its evolution time often scales quadratically in the inverse Hamiltonian spectral gap, leading to sub-optimal computational complexity. In this work, we introduce a nonlinear adaptive strategy for finding the time scheduling function, and show that the gap dependence can be quadratically improved to be inverse linear for a wide range of systems under a mild gap measure condition. Through variational analysis, we further demonstrate the optimality of our schedule for systems with linear gap and the partial optimality for general systems, while we also rigorously show that the commonly used linear schedule is never optimal.

Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy centers (NV) in proximity to diamond surfaces are promising nanoscale quantum sensors. However, their coherence properties are negatively affected by magnetic and electric surface noise, whose origin and detailed impact have remained elusive. Using atomistic models of diamond surfaces derived with density functional theory, together with decoherence time calculations with cluster correlation expansion methods, we quantify the effects of surface crystallographic orientation and functionalization, and of the density of unpaired electrons on the NV Hahn-echo time $T_2$. We determine a crossover depth at which $T_2$ ceases to be limited by surface nuclear spins and recovers the bulk-limited value. We find that for static surface-electron baths, the ratio between the NV depth and the separation between surface electron spins determines a transition from fast-fluctuating to quasi-static noise, leading to a dependence of $T_2$ on orientation for specific surfaces. We also find that the modulation of $T_2$ by spin-phonon relaxations leads to motional-narrowing at sub-microsecond relaxation times. Importantly, our calculations show that it is only when accounting for surface-spin in-sequence hopping that measured $T_2$ values as a function of depth can be reproduced, thus highlighting the importance of hopping-mediated models to describe the surface spin noise affecting NV sensors. Overall, our work provides clear guidelines for engineering diamond surfaces to achieve enhanced NV coherence for quantum sensing and information processing applications.

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) systems require optimal performance of both quantum and classical channels - utilizing as few as possible qubits and bits for establishing as many as possible key bits. Here we report a way to determine if a quantum key distribution model (or protocol) operates in an optimal behavior. This is accomplished by introducing a quantity, called optimality, which is the maximum over the total efficiency of a QKD under any circumstances (any values of QKD parameters). The optimality definition is given for the asymptotic operation of a QKD system - when infinitely many quantum systems are transferred/used in a quantum key distribution protocol or a quantum key distribution system is used infinitely many times. A way to attain the optimality is considered\textemdash implementation of a completely efficient QKD system (a combination of capacity-reaching quantum channel and a completely compressed classical channel) is presented. Optimal versions of BB84-QKD and twin-field QKD are introduced.

Our analysis shows that strong Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) violations and secure key generation over tens of kilometers are within reach using current or near-term technology. These results position cavity-based platforms with coherent-state encodings as a promising foundation for future scalable, DI quantum communication networks.

Abstract: Utility-scale quantum computers require quantum error correcting codes with large numbers of physical qubits to achieve sufficiently low logical error rates. The performance of quantum error correction (QEC) is generally predicted through large-scale numerical simulations, used to estimate thresholds, finite-size scaling, and exponential suppression of logical errors below threshold. The connection of QEC to models from statistical mechanics provides an alternative tool for analysing QEC performance. However, predicting the behaviour of these models also requires large-scale numerical simulations, as analytic solutions are not generally known. Here we exploit an exact mapping, from a toric code under bit-flip noise that is post-selected on being syndrome free to the exactly-solvable two-dimensional Ising model on a torus, to derive an analytic solution for the logical failure rate across its full domain of physical error rates. In particular, this mapping provides closed-form expressions for the logical failure rate in four distinct regimes: the path-counting, below-threshold (ordered), near-threshold (critical), and above-threshold (disordered) regimes. Our framework places a number of familiar and long-standing numerical observations on firm theoretical ground. It also motivates explicit ansätze for the conventional QEC setting of non-post-selected codes whose statistical mechanics mappings involve random-bond disorder. Specifically, we introduce an effective surface tension model for the below-threshold regime, and a new scaling ansatz for the near-threshold regime, derived from an analysis of the ground state energy cost distribution. By bridging statistical mechanics theory and quantum error correction practice, our results offer a new toolkit for designing, benchmarking, and understanding topological codes beyond current computational limits.

Abstract: We propose and analyze a robust population-transfer protocol in a driven two-level system based on a sudden sign change of the detuning at the maximum of a smooth coupling pulse. Away from the jump the dynamics is adiabatic, while the sign flip produces a single nonadiabatic kick in the adiabatic basis. Within a simple stepwise adiabatic-sudden approximation we obtain a compact analytic expression for the final transition probability, identify the parameter regimes that yield high-fidelity inversion, and show that the result depends only on the change of the mixing angle across the detuning jump, i.e., solely on the ratio of the peak Rabi frequency to the detuning. Numerical simulations of the full time-dependent Schrödinger equation confirm the validity and robustness of this description over a broad parameter range.
  We then use the Majorana decomposition to extend the scheme to an SU(2)-symmetric three-state chain driven by the same coupling and detuning functions. In this setting the three-state propagator is expressed in closed form through the two-level Cayley-Klein parameters, which allows us to derive explicit transition probabilities for all three initial states. In particular, we show that for strong coupling the protocol yields almost complete population transfer between the two outer states, with only small transient population of the middle state, while retaining the same intrinsic robustness as in the underlying two-level model.

Abstract: Quantum computing offers a promising paradigm for electromagnetic eigenmode analysis, enabling compact representations of complex field interactions and potential exponential speedup over classical numerical solvers. Recent efforts have applied variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) based methods to compute waveguide modes, demonstrating the feasibility of simulating TE and TM field distributions on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. However, these studies typically employ manually designed, fixed-depth parameterized quantum circuits and uniform measurement-shot strategies, resulting in excessive quantum resource consumption, limited circuit expressivity, and reduced robustness under realistic noise conditions. To address these limitations, we propose an architecture and shot adaptive subspace variational quantum eigensolver for efficient microwave waveguide eigenmode simulation on NISQ devices. The proposed framework integrates a reinforcement learning (RL) based circuit design strategy and an adaptive shot allocation mechanism to jointly reduce quantum resource overhead. Specifically, the RL agent autonomously explores the quantum circuit space to generate hardware-efficient parameterized quantum circuits, while the adaptive measurement scheme allocates sampling resources according to Hamiltonian term weights. Numerical experiments on three- and five-qubit systems demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves accurate estimation of TE and TM mode eigenvalues, with a minimum absolute error down to $10^{-8}$ and reconstructed field distributions under noiseless conditions in excellent agreement with classical electromagnetic solutions.

Abstract: We study distributed similarity estimation for unitary channels (DSEU), the task of estimating the similarity between unitary channels implemented on different quantum devices. We completely address DSEU by showing that, for $n$-qubit unitary channels, the query complexity of DSEU is $Θ(\sqrt{d})$, where $d=2^n$, for both incoherent and coherent accesses. First, we propose two estimation algorithms for DSEU with these accesses utilizing the randomized measurement toolbox. The query complexities of these algorithms are both $O(\sqrt{d})$. Although incoherent access is generally weaker than coherent access, our incoherent algorithm matches this complexity by leveraging additional shared randomness between devices, highlighting the power of shared randomness in distributed quantum learning. We further establish matching lower bounds, proving that $Θ(\sqrt{d})$ queries are both necessary and sufficient for DSEU. Finally, we compare our algorithms with independent classical shadow and show that ours have a square-root advantage. Our results provide practical and theoretically optimal tools for quantum devices benchmarking and for distributed quantum learning.

In particular, we prove that there is no ground to consider the aforementioned set as fundamental since there are many 3D contextual sets with a smaller number of complete bases. We also show that automatic generation of contextual sets from basic vector components automatically yields all known minimal contextual sets of any kind in any dimension and therefore also the aforementioned set in no CPU-time. In the end, we discuss varieties of contextual sets, in particular Kochen-Specker (KS), extended KS, and non-KS sets as well as ambiguities in their definitions.

Abstract: This work develops tools to understand how quantum information spreads, scrambles, and is reshaped by measurements in many-body systems. First, I study scrambling and pseudorandomness in the Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, quantifying pseudorandomness using unitary k-designs and frame potentials. Using Keldysh path integrals with replicas and disorder averaging, I obtain analytic control of the approach to randomness, identify collective modes that delay convergence to Haar-like behavior, and estimate design times as functions of model parameters, clarifying links between scrambling, complexity growth, and random-circuit phenomenology. Second, I construct a field theory for weakly measured SYK clusters. Starting from a system-ancilla description and a continuum monitoring limit, and using fermionic coherent states with replicas and disorder averaging, I derive a nonlinear sigma model that captures measurement back-action and the competition between interaction-induced scrambling and information extraction, predicting characteristic crossover scales and response signatures that distinguish weak monitoring from fully unitary evolution. Third, I develop a strong-disorder renormalization group for measurement-only SYK clusters, based on the SO(2n) replica algebra and Dasgupta-Ma decimation rules. The flow shows features reminiscent of infinite-randomness behavior, but an order-of-limits subtlety renders the leading recursions non-robust, so the analytic evidence for an infinite-randomness fixed point is inconclusive, even though the average second Renyi entropy displays logarithmic scaling. Together, these results provide a unified language to diagnose when many-body dynamics generate operational randomness and how measurements redirect that flow.

Abstract: We introduce quantum parameter estimation with the encoding being via a quantum measurement. We quantify the precision for estimating parameters characterizing a general two-outcome qubit measurement, considering two cases: when the outcomes of the encoding measurement are recorded and when the same are ignored. We find that in a large variety of such estimation scenarios, forgetting the outcomes yields higher precision. We derive a necessary criterion under which remembering the measurement outcomes provides better precision in comparison to the outcome-forgotten strategy. Furthermore, we establish a necessary and sufficient criterion for the simultaneous estimation of two parameters encoded by an arbitrary quantum process, including those involving measurements, using qubit probes, and find when the quantum Cramér$-$Rao bound is valid and achievable. For simultaneous estimation of two parameters characterizing the measurement, we find that the achievable quantum Cramér$-$Rao bound can be a valid precision bound only when the measurement direction depends on the parameters of interest.

Abstract: The opening of Arctic sea routes presents unprecedented opportunities for global trade but poses significant operational and computational challenges due to the dynamic nature of sea ice conditions. This study formulates a multi criteria Arctic route optimization problem that integrates Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) variables into a Constrained Quadratic Model (CQM) and solves it using D Wave's hybrid quantum classical solver. We benchmark the feasibility and scalability of this approach against classical Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) solvers such as Gurobi and CPLEX. Results show that the CQM formulation achieves feasible solutions with stable runtimes as quadratic density increases, demonstrating 10 to 100 times faster convergence and reduced computational time compared with classical solvers, while also improving route smoothness by approximately 10 percent and reducing total length by approximately 1 percent. This reflects the effectiveness of the hybrid quantum annealing approach for Arctic routing problems.

Abstract: Finite-capacity single-server queues with general service-time distributions form the backbone of numerous real-world systems, yet classical simulation of performance metrics such as blocking probabilities and delay becomes computationally prohibitive as service variability or required precision increases. This work presents the first coherent quantum circuit for simulating an M/G/1/K queue under arbitrary service-time laws. The circuit encodes the service distribution through a logarithmic-depth ladder of $R_y$ rotations and enforces buffer constraints via a comparator-controlled phase gate, while preserving the quadratic speed-up of amplitude amplification. Grover iterations center on estimating the expected number of customers in the system, yielding provable $O(\sqrt{N})$ variance reduction and closed-form confidence bounds, where $N$ denotes the number of shots. Empirical evaluations on IBM quantum simulators across four service distributions and three traffic intensities demonstrate fidelity above 0.99 with four qubits and above 0.76 with ten qubits, with Jensen-Shannon divergence below 0.11. Waiting-time estimation errors decrease by an order of magnitude as system load approaches capacity and remain within 3% in high-traffic regimes using registers of up to 63 qubits. These results establish the first end-to-end quantum simulation framework for finite-buffer, non-Markovian queueing systems and provide a concrete foundation for quantum-accelerated performance analysis in service-oriented architectures.

Abstract: We investigate the phase sensitivity of a linear two-mode atom interferometer subject to environmental noise, modeled within the framework of open quantum systems with both number-conserving and non-conserving Lindblad operators. Considering several input states, we first study the cases N=1,2 (N number of particles) and perform numerical simulations for N>2. The sensitivity as a function of the holding time can display divergence points where phase estimation becomes impossible, to which we refer as insensitivity points. We characterize their behavior as the input state, particle number, and noise operator are varied, and we find that their positions are independent of the noise intensity. Moreover, while our fixed measurement scheme may favor number-conserving noise at small N (i.e., having better sensitivity), the Cramér-Rao bound reveals that particle non-conserving noise yields strictly lower achievable sensitivity for all particle numbers.

Abstract: Quantum computing (QC) promises theoretical advantages, benefiting computational problems that would not be efficiently classically simulatable. However, much of this theoretical speedup depends on the quantum circuit design solving the problem. We argue that QC literature has yet to explore more domain specific ansatz-topologies, instead of relying on generic, one-size-fits-all architectures. In this work, we show that incorporating task-specific inductive biases -- specifically geometric priors -- into quantum circuit design can enhance the performance of hybrid Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QuGANs) on the task of generating geometrically constrained K4 graphs. We evaluate a portfolio of entanglement topologies and loss-function designs to assess their impact on both statistical fidelity and compliance with geometric constraints, including the Triangle and Ptolemaic inequalities. Our results show that aligning circuit topology with the underlying problem structure yields substantial benefits: the Triangle-topology QuGAN achieves the highest geometric validity among quantum models and matches the performance of classical Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Additionally, we showcase how specific architectural choices, such as entangling gate types, variance regularization and output-scaling govern the trade-off between geometric consistency and distributional accuracy, thus emphasizing the value of structured, task-aware quantum ansatz-topologies.

Abstract: Bosonic Gaussian states appear ubiquitously in quantum optics and condensed matter physics but remain difficult to simulate classically due to the hafnian bottleneck. We present an efficient algorithm that converts pure bosonic Gaussian states into matrix product states (MPSs), with a computational cost governed solely by the entanglement and not by the number of bosonic modes. Our method combines a Gaussian singular value decomposition with a projected-creation-operator mapping that constructs local MPS tensors without computing hafnians. Benchmarking on covariance matrices from the Jiuzhang 2.0 and Jiuzhang 4.0 Gaussian boson sampling experiments demonstrates substantial speedups over previous tensor-network approaches in the low-entanglement regime relevant to lossy devices. The method provides a scalable classical simulation framework for bosonic Gaussian states with limited entanglement and extends the applicability of MPS-based methods to a broad range of bosonic systems.

Abstract: Entanglement swapping is a protocol that details how to create entanglement between previously uncorrelated particles. Its all-photonic version - mediated by the interference of photon pairs generated by separate quantum systems-finds disparate applications in quantum networks. So far, all-photonic entanglement swapping between remote systems has been implemented only using sources that operate probabilistically. However, the scaling up of quantum networks requires deterministic quantum emitters that do not suffer from a trade-off between degree of entanglement and photonpair generation rate. Here, we demonstrate all-photonic entanglement swapping using photon-pairs generated by two separate GaAs quantum dots. The emitters are deterministically embedded in hybrid semiconductor-piezoelectric devices that make the entangled-photons from two dissimilar quantum dots nearly identical. Entanglement swapping is demonstrated with a fidelity as high as 0.71(2), more than 10 standard deviations above the classical limit. The experimental data are quantitatively explained by a theoretical model that also suggests how to boost the protocol performances. Our work opens the path to the exploitation of quantum dot entangled-photon sources in quantum repeater networks.

Abstract: While Quantum Machine Learning (QML) holds great potential, its practical realization on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware has been hindered by the limitations of variational quantum circuits (VQCs). Recent evidence suggests that VQCs suffer from severe trainability and noise-related issues, leading to growing skepticism about their long-term viability. However, the possibility of implementing learning models directly at the pulse-control level remains comparatively unexplored and could offer a promising alternative. In this work, we formulate a pulse-based variant of data re-uploading, embedding trainable parameters directly into the native system's dynamics. We benchmark our approach on a simulated superconducting transmon processor with realistic noise profiles. The pulse-based model consistently outperforms its gate-based counterpart, exhibiting higher test accuracy and improved generalization under equivalent noise conditions. Moreover, by systematically increasing noise strength, we show that pulse-level implementations retain higher fidelity for longer, demonstrating enhanced resilience to decoherence and control errors. These results suggest that pulse-native architectures, though less explored, may offer a viable and hardware-aligned path forward for practical QML in the NISQ era.

Abstract: Ionizing radiation has emerged as a potential limiting factor for superconducting quantum processors, inducing quasiparticle bursts and correlated errors that challenge fault-tolerant operation. Atmospheric muons are particularly problematic due to their high energy and penetration power, making passive shielding ineffective. Therefore, monitoring the real-time muon flux is crucial to guide the development of alternative error-correction or protection strategies. We present the design, simulation, and first operation of a cryogenic muon-tagging system based on Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) for integration with superconducting quantum processors. The system consists of two KIDs arranged in a vertical stack and operated at ~20 mK. Monte Carlo simulations based on Geant4 guided the prototype design and provided reference expectations for muon-tagging efficiency and accidental coincidences due to ambient $γ$-rays. We measured a muon-induced coincidence rate among the top and bottom detectors of (192 $\pm$ 9) $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ events/s, in excellent agreement with the Monte Carlo prediction. The prototype achieves a muon-tagging efficiency of about 90% with negligible dead time. These results demonstrate the feasibility of operating a muon-tagging system at millikelvin temperatures and open the path toward its integration with multi-qubit chips to veto or correct muon-induced errors in real time.

Abstract: The main bottleneck for distributed quantum computing is the rate at which entanglement is produced between quantum processing units (QPUs). In this work, we prove that multiple QPUs connected through slow interconnects can outperform a monolithic architecture made with a single QPU. We consider a distributed quantum computing model with the following assumptions: (1) each QPU is linked to only two other QPUs, (2) each link produces only one Bell pair at a time, (3) the time to generate a Bell pair is $τ_e$ times longer than the gate time. We propose a distributed version of the CliNR partial error correction scheme respecting these constraints and we show through circuit level simulations that, even if the entanglement generation time $τ_e$ is up to five times longer than the gate time, distributed CliNR can achieve simultaneously a lower logical error rate and a shorter depth than both the direct implementation and the monolithic CliNR implementation of random Clifford circuits. In the asymptotic regime, we relax assumption (2) and we prove that links producing $O(t/\ln t)$ Bell pairs in parallel, where $t$ is the number of QPUs, is sufficient to avoid stalling distributed CliNR, independently of the number of qubits per QPU. This demonstrates the potential of distributed CliNR for near-term multi-QPU devices. Moreover, we envision a distributed quantum superiority experiment based on the conjugated Clifford circuits of Bouland, Fitzsimons and Koh implemented with distributed CliNR.

Abstract: Cooling quantum systems with finite resources is a central task in quantum technologies and has been extensively explored in discrete-variable settings. As continuous-variable (CV) platforms play an increasingly important role in quantum information processing, it becomes crucial to understand the fundamental limitations of cooling bosonic systems. In this work, we develop a general framework for cooling CV systems, identifying both the constraints imposed by Gaussianity and the advantages enabled by non-Gaussian interactions. We derive a reachable bound on the cooling performance of Gaussian operations that applies to arbitrary cooling architectures. By optimizing over all protocols saturating this bound, we further identify the most efficient scheme, which minimizes dissipated energy for a given number of ancilla modes. Beyond Gaussian operations, we show that $p$-excitation exchange exploits non-Gaussian resources to achieve a $p$-fold enhancement of the cooling limit. Our results establish the fundamental limits of CV heat-bath algorithmic cooling and reveal the crucial role of non-Gaussianity in surpassing Gaussian cooling barriers.

Abstract: Superconducting quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize computational capabilities. However, scaling up large quantum processors is limited by the cumbersome and heat-conductive electronic cables that connect room-temperature control electronics to quantum processors, leading to significant signal attenuation. Optical fibers provide a promising solution, but their use has been restricted to controlling simple two-level quantum systems over short distances. Here, we demonstrate optical control of a bosonic quantum processor, achieving universal operations on the joint Hilbert space of a transmon qubit and a storage cavity. Using an array of cryogenic fiber-integrated uni-traveling-carrier photodiodes, we prepare Fock states containing up to ten photons. Additionally, remote control of bosonic modes over a transmission distance of 15 km has been achieved, with fidelities exceeding 95%. The combination of high-dimensional quantum control, multi-channel operation, and long-distance transmission addresses the key requirements for scaling superconducting quantum computers and enables architectures for distributed quantum data centers.

Abstract: A Bernoulli factory is a model for randomness manipulation that transforms an initial Bernoulli random variable into another Bernoulli variable by applying a predetermined function relating the output bias to the input one. In literature, quantum-to-quantum Bernoulli factory schemes have been proposed, which encode both the input and output variables using qubit amplitudes. This fundamental concept can serve as a subroutine for quantum algorithms that involve Bayesian inference and Monte Carlo methods, or that require data encryption, like in blind quantum computation. In this work, we present a characterisation of the complexity of the quantum-to-quantum Bernoulli factory by providing a lower bound on the required number of qubits needed to implement the protocol, an upper bound on the success probability and the quantum circuit that saturates the bounds. We also formalise and analyse two different variants of the original problem that address the possibility of increasing the number of input biases or the number of functions implemented by the quantum-to-quantum Bernoulli factory. The obtained results can be used as a framework for randomness manipulation via such an approach.

Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a fundamental challenge in combinatorial optimization, widely applied in logistics and transportation. As the size of TSP instances grows, traditional algorithms often struggle to produce high-quality solutions within reasonable timeframes. This study investigates the potential of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), a hybrid quantum-classical method, to solve TSP under realistic constraints. We adopt a QUBO-based formulation of TSP that integrates real-world logistical constraints reflecting operational conditions, such as vehicle capacity, road accessibility, and time windows, while ensuring compatibility with the limitations of current quantum hardware. Our experiments are conducted in a simulated environment using high-performance computing (HPC) resources to assess QAOA's performance across different problem sizes and quantum circuit depths. In order to improve scalability, we propose clustering QAOA (Cl-QAOA), a hybrid approach combining classical machine learning with QAOA. This method decomposes large TSP instances into smaller sub-problems, making quantum optimization feasible even on devices with a limited number of qubits. The results offer a comprehensive evaluation of QAOA's strengths and limitations in solving constrained TSP scenarios. This study advances quantum optimization and lays groundwork for future large-scale applications.

Abstract: We consolidate recent theoretical advances in Detector Error Model (DEM) estimation and formalize several algorithms to learn DEM parameters and structure from syndromes without using a decoder, demonstrating recovery of known DEMs from simulated syndromes with precision limited only by finite-sample effects. We then apply these algorithms to estimate DEMs from Google's 72- and 105-qubit chips. Using a likelihood function that is tractable for small DEMs, we show that DEMs estimated directly from syndromes agree more closely with unseen syndromes than DEMs trained to optimize logical performance, whereas the latter outperform the former as priors for decoders in logical memory experiments. We used a time-series of estimated DEMs to track both global error and specific local errors over the course of a QEC experiment, suggesting applications in online characterization. We employ a sequence of DEM estimation techniques to discover and quantify long-range detector correlations spanning the width of the 105-qubit chip, for which DEM analysis suggests correlated measurement errors rather than high-weight Pauli errors as the most likely explanation. Finally, we present two artifacts in repetition code syndromes that are \emph{not} well-modeled by a DEM: correlated flipping of pairs of adjacent detectors in many consecutive rounds of QEC, and signatures consistent with radiation events occurring more frequently than previously reported.

Second, we leverage the expressivity of the LUCI framework as an intermediate representation, using integer linear programming to find performant physical circuits from the large space of valid LUCI circuits. We show that on the $d = 11$ surface code at $1\%(3\%)$ dropout rate for qubits and couplers, these optimizations allow for a total improvement of $14.5\%(23.6\%)$ over $4d$ round of syndrome extraction using the SI1000 noise model at $0.1\%$ noise.

Abstract: Quantum Imaginary-Time Evolution (QITE) is a powerful method for preparing ground states on quantum hardware. However, executing QITE has costly measurement budgets for general Hamiltonians. Both fidelity and computational cost are strongly dependent on the definition of suitable local domains and Hamiltonian partitions. In this work, we introduce the Multiple-Time QITE algorithm (MT-QITE). We show how using more than one imaginary time substantially improves the fidelity of the resulting ground state as well as the measurement overhead with respect to the previously published QITE algorithm, while preserving its deterministic character and its independence from ad hoc ansatze. Moreover, unlike QITE and other QITE-based algorithms, MT-QITE is parallelizable, and we show that even in Hamiltonians with non-local interactions, partitioning may entail a computational advantage.

Abstract: We present entcalc, a Python and MATLAB package for estimating the geometric entanglement of multipartite quantum states. The package operates as follows: given a multipartite quantum state as input, it outputs an estimate of its geometric entanglement. For pure states, it computes the geometric entanglement together with an estimation error. For mixed states, it provides both lower and upper bounds on the geometric entanglement, thereby identifying an interval in which the true value lies. We provide several methods to compute the lower bound, enabling users to balance accuracy against computational cost. We apply entcalc to several representative examples, including for $3\otimes3$ PPT entangled states, mixtures of GHZ and W states, thermal states of selected three-qubit spin chains, and noisy GHZ and W states. We observe signatures of quantum phase transitions by quantifying entanglement in spin chains. We also demonstrate that entanglement between non-neighbouring sites can be activated by tuning the external magnetic field. In all tested cases, the gap between the lower and upper bounds is found to be very small, indicating that entcalc provides highly accurate estimates of the geometric entanglement for these states.

Abstract: Recent theoretical and experimental work has shown that the quantum Fisher information associated with estimating the separation between two optical point sources remains finite at small separations, effectively opening new routes to super-resolution imaging of simultaneously emitting sources. Most studies to date, however, implicitly invoke the scalar approximation, which is not appropriate in the context of high-numerical-aperture microscopy. Utilizing parameter estimation theory, here we consider the estimation of separation between two closely spaced dipole emitters, a commonly employed model for single-molecule optical beacons. We consider two limiting cases: one in which the orientations of the emitters are fixed and equal, and another in which both dipoles freely sample all of orientation space over the course of the measurement. We quantify precision limits using quantum and classical variants of the Fisher information and Cramér-Rao bound. In all cases, the vectorial nature of the emission complicates the analyses, but with appropriate filtering of the collected light in the azimuthal-radial polarization basis, a previously proposed scheme to saturate the quantum Fisher information via image inversion interferometry can be salvaged.

Abstract: We propose a method for approximating the contraction of a tensor network by partitioning the network into a sum of computationally cheaper networks. This method, which we call a partitioned network expansion (PNE), builds upon recent work that systematically improves belief propagation (BP) approximations using loop corrections. However, in contrast to previous approaches, our expansion does not require a known BP fixed point to be implemented and can still yield accurate results even in cases where BP fails entirely. The flexibility of our approach is demonstrated through applications to a variety of example networks, including finite 2D and 3D networks, infinite networks, networks with open indices, and networks with degenerate BP fixed points. Benchmark numerical results for networks composed of Ising, AKLT, and random tensors typically show an improvement in accuracy over BP by several orders of magnitude (when BP solutions are obtainable) and also demonstrate improved performance over traditional network approximations based on singular value decomposition (SVD) for certain tasks.

Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of a single bosonic cavity subject to two-photon driving and two-photon dissipation in the presence of finite detuning. Exploiting a hidden time-reversal symmetry, the Wigner representation and the WKB method, we introduce an effective phase-space potential for description of the steady state. It reveals two attracting points, which are metastable due to quantum fluctuations. By employing the Keldysh real-time path integral formalism, we compute the instanton trajectory governing the quantum activation process between these attractors and establish a fundamental connection with the Wigner representation. This relation unifies the steady-state phase-space description with dynamical quantum activation processes. We also derive an analytical expression for the decoherence rate of the system. Our work provides a coherent theoretical framework for analyzing quantum bistability, metastability, and decoherence in driven-dissipative nonlinear resonators, with direct implications for the design of bosonic qubits and quantum information processing.

Abstract: We develop a framework for learning from noisy quantum experiments, focusing on fault-tolerant devices accessing uncharacterized systems through noisy couplings. Our starting point is the complexity class $\textsf{NBQP}$ ("noisy BQP"), modeling noisy fault-tolerant quantum computers that cannot, in general, error-correct the oracle systems they query. Using this class, we show that for natural oracle problems, noise can eliminate exponential quantum learning advantages of ideal noiseless learners while preserving a superpolynomial gap between NISQ and fault-tolerant devices. Beyond oracle separations, we study concrete noisy learning tasks. For purity testing, the exponential two-copy advantage collapses under a single application of local depolarizing noise. Nevertheless, we identify a setting motivated by AdS/CFT in which noise-resilient structure restores a quantum learning advantage in a noisy regime. We then analyze noisy Pauli shadow tomography, deriving lower bounds that characterize how instance size, quantum memory, and noise control sample complexity, and design algorithms with parametrically similar scalings. Together, our results show that the Bell-basis and SWAP-test primitives underlying most exponential quantum learning advantages are fundamentally fragile to noise unless the experimental system has latent noise-robust structure. Thus, realizing meaningful quantum advantages in future experiments will require understanding how noise-robust physical properties interface with available algorithmic techniques.

Abstract: Higher-order topological insulators have attracted significant interest in recent years. However, identifying a universal topological invariant capable of characterizing higher-order topology remains challenging. Here, we propose a entanglement topological invariant designed to characterize secondorder topological systems. This entanglement topological invariant captures the entanglement of topological corner states under open boundary conditions by employing a bipartite entanglement entropy method. In several representative models, the entanglement topological invariant assumes a nonzero value exclusively in the presence of second-order topology, with its magnitude exactly matching the number of topologically protected corner states. Consequently, the proposed entanglement topological invariant not only provides a clear criterion for detecting higher-order topology, but also offers a quantitative measure for the related corner states. Our study establishes a universal and precise method for characterizing higher-order topological phases, opening avenues for their fundamental understanding and future investigations.

Abstract: The Johnson-Nyquist noise associated with the intrinsic conductivity of the electron liquid, induces fluctuations of the electron density in charge-neutral graphene devices. In the presence of external electric and magnetic fields, the fluctuations of charge density and electric current induce a fluctuating hydrodynamic flow. We show that the resulting advection of charge produces a fluctuation contribution to the macroscopic conductivity of the system, $σ_{\mathrm{fl}}$, and develop a quantitative theory of $σ_{\mathrm{fl}}$. At zero magnetic field, $σ_{\mathrm{fl}}$ diverges logarithmically with the system size and becomes rapidly suppressed at relatively small fields. This results in giant magnetoresistance of the system.

Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are key building blocks for photonic quantum technologies, enabling practical sources of non-classical light. A central challenge for scalable integration is the direct epitaxial growth of high-quality emitters on industry-compatible silicon platforms. Furthermore, for long-distance fiber-based quantum communication, emission in the telecom O- or C-band is essential. Here, we demonstrate the direct growth of high-quality InGaAs/GaAs QDs emitting in the telecom O-band using a strain-reducing layer approach on silicon. Deterministic integration of individual QDs into circular Bragg grating resonators is achieved via in-situ electron-beam lithography. The resulting devices exhibit strong out-coupling enhancement, with photon extraction efficiencies up to $(40 \pm 2)\%$, in excellent agreement with numerical simulations. These results highlight the high material quality of both the epitaxial platform and the photonic nanostructure, as well as the precise lateral positioning of the emitter within 20~nm of the resonator center. At cryogenic temperature (4~K) and low excitation power ($0.027\times P_\text{sat}$), the devices show excellent single-photon purity, exceeding 99\%. Operation at elevated temperatures of 40~K and 77~K, compatible with compact Stirling cryo-coolers and liquid-nitrogen cooling, reveals robust performance, with single-photon purity maintained at $(88.4 \pm 0.6)\%$ at 77~K. These results demonstrate a practical and scalable route toward silicon-based quantum light sources and provide a promising path for cost-effective fabrication and seamless integration of quantum photonics with classical electronics, representing an important step toward large-scale, chip-based quantum information systems.

Abstract: Localized particle-like spin textures have been found to exhibit emergent electromagnetic properties, which hold promise for the development of intriguing spintronic devices. Among these textures, magnetic bubbles represent localized spin configurations that could serve as data bits. However, the precise methods for their electrical manipulation remain uncertain. Here, we demonstrate the deterministic electrical manipulations and detections of single magnetic bubbles in kagome-latticed Fe3Sn2 magnetic nanostructured cells. The current-induced dynamics of magnetic bubbles were explored using nanosecond pulsed currents. We show single pulsed currents with low and high densities can be applied for the creation and deletion of a single bubble, respectively. The mutual writing-deleting operations on single bubbles are attributed to the thermal heating and non-thermal spin-transfer torque effects in combination with micromagnetic simulations. We also realized the in-situ detection of a single bubble using the anisotropic magnetoresistance effect through a standard four-probe method. Our results could propel the development of bubble-based spintronic devices.

Abstract: Topological spin textures are characterized by topological magnetic charges, Q, which govern their electromagnetic properties. Recent studies have achieved skyrmion bundles with arbitrary integer values of Q, opening possibilities for exploring topological spintronics based on Q. However, the realization of stable skyrmion bundles in chiral magnets at room temperature and zero magnetic field - the prerequisite for realistic device applications - has remained elusive. Here, through the combination of pulsed currents and reversed magnetic fields, we experimentally achieve skyrmion bundles with different integer Q values - reaching a maximum of 24 at above room temperature and zero magnetic field - in the chiral magnet Co8Zn10Mn2. We demonstrate the field-driven annihilation of high-Q bundles and present a phase diagram as a function of temperature and field. Our experimental findings are consistently corroborated by micromagnetic simulations, which reveal the nature of the skyrmion bundle as that of skyrmion tubes encircled by a fractional Hopfion.

Abstract: Two parallel helical edge channels hosting interacting electrons, when proximitized by local and nonlocal pairings, can host time-reversal-invariant pairs of topological zero modes at the system corners. Here we show that realistic imperfections substantially enrich the physics of such proximitized double helical liquids. Specifically, we analyze this platform and its fractional counterparts in the presence of pairing and interaction asymmetries between the two channels, as well as random spin-flip terms arising from either magnetic disorder or coexisting charge disorder and external magnetic fields. Using renormalization-group analysis, we determine how Coulomb interactions, pairings, and magnetic disorder collectively influence the transport behavior and topological properties of the double helical liquid. As the system transitions from class DIII to class BDI, an additional topological phase supporting a single Majorana zero mode per corner emerges. We further show how additional pairing or Coulomb asymmetry influences the stability of various topological phases and uncovers a revival of Majorana zero modes and cascades of transitions through topological phases characterized by a $\mathbb {Z}$ invariant, which are accessible through controlling the electrical screening effect. In contrast to conventional understanding, disorder is not merely detrimental, as it in general allows for a tuning knob that qualitatively reshapes the topological superconductivity in imperfect helical liquids.

Abstract: Recent experiments have reported valley-gauge-symmetry-broken phases, identified as intervalley coherent (IVC) states. Exploration of anomalous responses, particularly those analogous to superconductivity, has become an urgent theoretical issue. In this study, we show that the IVC order gives rise to anomalous valley-current generation driven by surface acoustic waves (SAWs). The anomalous valley current exhibits a characteristic power-law dependence for low-frequency SAWs. Furthermore, we demonstrate by numerical analysis that the IVC order significantly enhances valley-current generation in rhombohedral graphene. These results open a pathway toward exploring exotic phenomena emerging from valley-gauge-symmetry breaking, in close analogy with gauge-symmetry breaking in superconductors.

Abstract: The semi-empirical INDO/s method is popular for studies of excitation energies and absorption of molecules due to its low computational requirement, making it possible to make predictions for large systems. However, its accuracy is generally low, particularly, when compared with the typical accuracy of other methods such as time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). Here, we present machine learning (ML) models that correct the INDO/s results with negligible increases in the amount of computing resources needed. While INDO/s excitations energies have an average error of about 1.1 eV relative to TDDFT energies, the added ML corrections reduce the error to 0.2 eV. Furthermore, this combination of INDO/s and ML produces UV-Vis absorption spectra that are in good agreement with the TDDFT predictions.

Abstract: We show that a small charged probe near a spherical topological insulator causes the latter to rotate around a symmetry axis defined by the center of the sphere and the position of the charge outside the latter. The rotation occurs when the distance from the charge to the center of the sphere is changed. This phenomenon occurs due to induced static fields and is a consequence of the axion electrodynamics underlying the electromagnetic response of a topological insulator. Assuming a regime where the charged probe can be regarded as a point charge $q=Ne$, where $N$ is a positive integer and $e$ is the elementary electric charge, we obtain that the rotation frequency is given by $ω=(Nα)^2Υ(ε,d/a)/I$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia, $α$ is the fine-structure constant, and the function $Υ$ depends on the dielectric constant $ε$ and the relative distance $d/a$ of the charge from the center of the sphere of radius $a$. Since the point charge also induces Hall currents on the surface, we compute also their associated angular momentum. This allows us to derive an exact expression for the electronic velocity on the surface as a function of $a/d$.

Abstract: Multilayered synthetic antiferromagnets (SAFs) are artificial three-dimensional (3D) architectures engineered to create novel, complex, and stable spin textures. Non-invasive and quantitative nanoscale magnetic imaging of the two-dimensional stray field profile at the sample surface is essential for understanding the fundamental properties of the spin-structure and being able to tailor them to achieve new functionalities. However, the deterministic detection of spin textures and their quantitative characterization on the nanoscale remain challenging. Here, we use nitrogen-vacancy scanning probe microscopy (NV-SPM) under ambient conditions to perform the first quantitative vector-field magnetometry measurements in the multilayered SAF [(Co/Pt)$_5$/Co/Ru]$_3$/(Co/Pt)$_6$. We investigate nanoscale static and dynamic properties of antiferromagnetic domains with boundaries hosting ``one-dimensional'' ferromagnetic stripes with ~ 100 nm of width and periodic modulation of the magnetization. By employing NV-SPM measurements in different imaging modes and involving NV-probes with various crystallographic orientations, we demonstrated distinct fingerprints emerging from GHz-range spin noise and constant stray fields on the order of several mT. This provides quantitative insights into the structure of domains and domain walls, as well as, into magnetic noise associated with thermal spin-waves. Our work opens up new opportunities for quantitative vector-field magnetometry of modern magnetic materials with tailored 3D spin textures and stray field profiles, and potentially novel spin-wave dispersions--in a quantitative and non-invasive manner, with exceptional magnetic sensitivity and nanometer scale spatial resolution.

Abstract: Interlayer exchange in synthetic antiferromagnets incorporating thin paramagnetic spacers can be controlled thermally. The spacer provides an additional ferromagnetic contribution that renormalizes the otherwise temperature-independent interlayer coupling. As a result, the system shows antiferromagnetic alignment at high temperatures and ferromagnetic alignment at low temperatures. This behavior is observed in Fe(2 nm)/Cr(0.4 nm)/Fe$_{17.5}$Cr$_{82.5}$(0.9 nm)/Cr(0.4 nm)/Fe(2 nm) multilayers with the inner spacer Fe$_{17.5}$Cr$_{82.5}$ paramagnetic at and above room temperature, and is shown to be due to the spacer being significantly magnetically polarized on lowering the temperature toward its Curie point. Although the Fe layers lack intrinsic magnetocrystalline anisotropy, the magnetization reversal demonstrates a field-induced uniaxial anisotropy of antiferromagnetic character. The resulting reversal process resembles that of a metamagnet with a spin-flip transition.

Abstract: Conventional wisdom dictates that the conducting edge states of two-dimensional topological insulators of the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ family are protected by time-reversal symmetry. However, theoretical bulk calculations and a recent experiment show that the edge states persist in the presence of large external magnetic fields. To address this apparent contradiction, we have developed an analytical description for the edge-state wave function of a semi-infinite sample in a perpendicular magnetic field. Our description relies on the usual bulk Landau levels, together with additional states arising due to the presence of the hard wall, which are unnormalizable in the infinite system. The analytical wave functions agree extremely well with numerical calculations and can be used to directly analyze the behavior of the edge states in a magnetic field.

Abstract: Optically inactive dark trions in two-dimensional semiconductors are poised to play a stellar role in future quantum technologies due to their long lifetimes, about two orders of magnitude greater than those of their bright counterparts. In monolayer (ML) tungsten disulphide (WS$_2$), accessing these states via optical activation remains challenging, specially at elevated temperatures. Here, we demonstrate the brightening of dark trions from ML WS$_2$ in the temperature range, 83 K-115 K, via localized surface plasmon modes in a disordered gold substrate. The resulting photoluminescence (PL) spectrum reveals a distinct spectral doublet with the twin peaks separated by ~ 45 meV. We propose that the peaks represent semi-dark and bright trion states, the origin of which lies in intervalley electron-electron scatterings. We also report on the experimental evidence of a negative degree of circular polarization in ML WS$_2$ at the energy of the semi-dark trion state.

Abstract: Open-shell nanographenes provide a versatile platform to host unconventional magnetic states within their π-conjugated networks. Particularly appealing are graphene architectures that incorporate spatially separated radicals and tunable interactions, offering a scalable route toward spin-based quantum architectures. Triangulenes are ideal for this purpose, as their radical count scales with size, although strong hybridization prevents individual spin control. Here, we realize a radical reconfiguration strategy that transforms a single-radical aza-triangulene into a frustrated antiferromagnetic triradical by covalently extending it with armchair anthene moieties of increasing length. Scanning tunnelling spectroscopy reveals edge-localized Kondo resonances and a doublet-to-quartet spin excitation, evidencing the emergence of correlated spins. Multi-reference electronic-structure calculations trace the progressive increase in polyradical character with anthene length, driven by the clustering of frontier states within a narrow energy window. Consequently, the initial single-radical doublet reorganizes into a frustrated triradical with weakly coupled edge spins, a molecular analog of a three-qubit quantum register.

Abstract: Bilayer graphene (BLG) cavities, where electrons are confined in finite graphene flakes, provide a suitable platform to study quantum chaotic phenomena in condensed matter systems due to the trigonal warping of the Fermi surface. Here, we investigate the effect of the misalignment between the BLG lattice and the cavity geometry, introduced by rotating the boundary relative to the lattice, which can drive the system towards chaos. Based on a tight-binding model, eigenenergy level statistics reveals that rotation leads to level repulsion following Wigner-Dyson statistics, while corresponding eigenstate analysis indicates a transition from near-integrability to spatially uncorrelated random waves. Analysis of the semiclassical ray-dynamics with the trigonal-warped dispersion unveils an ergodic phase space structure, providing a quantum-classical correspondence of the onset of chaos. These findings establish an avenue to quantum chaotic phenomena in BLG cavities with potential applications in quantum device engineering.

Abstract: Electronic bands in chirally stacked $n$ layer carbon-based honeycomb heterostructures, encompassing rhombohedral ($n \geq 3$), Bernal bilayer ($n=2$), and monolayer ($n=1$) graphene, possess four-fold valley and spin degeneracy. Such systems with $n \geq 2$, when subject to external perpendicular electric displacement fields, feature a fully degenerate metal at high doping, a spin non-degenerate but valley degenerate half-metal at moderate doping, and a non-degenerate quarter-metal at low doping. Due to the fully polarized nature of the quasiparticles in the quarter-metal, realized around one particular valley otherwise chosen spontaneously, it can sustain a single local superconducting ground state, representing a pair-density-wave that is chiral and odd parity in nature. From a leading order renormalization group analysis, here we show that repulsive density-density interaction among such polarized fermionic excitations can foster the pair-density-wave phase at low temperatures. Possible connections with experimentally observed superconducting states in the close vicinity of the quarter-metal in some members of such graphene heterostructures family are discussed.

Abstract: Indium phosphide (InP) high electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) are widely used in many fields such as quantum computing because of their unparalleled microwave noise performance. Achieving improved noise performance requires a physical understanding of the noise mechanisms. Here, we experimentally test a theoretical proposal for drain (output) noise as originating in part from real-space transfer (RST) by characterizing the microwave noise temperature of transfer-length method structures with the same channel composition but two different barrier compositions. This choice was made to alter the confining potential of electrons in the channel, thereby affecting the RST mechanism, while avoiding changes to the channel transport properties. We observe trends of noise temperature with physical temperature and source-drain voltage which are compatible with the predictions of RST noise theory. This finding supports the hypothesis that RST contributes to drain noise in HEMTs.

Abstract: Fifth-generation (5G) communication systems, operating in higher frequency bands from 3 to 300 GHz, provide unprecedented bandwidth to enable ultra-high data rates and low-latency services. However, the use of millimeter-wave frequencies raises public health concerns regarding prolonged electromagnetic radiation (EMR) exposure. Above 6 GHz, the incident power density (IPD) is used instead of the specific absorption rate (SAR) for exposure assessment, owing to the shallow penetration depth of millimeter waves. This paper proposes a hybrid field reconstruction framework that integrates classical electromagnetic algorithms with deep learning to evaluate the IPD of wireless communication devices operating at 30 GHz, thereby determining compliance with established RF exposure limits. An initial estimate of the electric field on the evaluation plane is obtained using a classical reconstruction algorithm, followed by refinement through a neural network model that learns the mapping between the initial and accurate values. A multi-antenna dataset, generated via full-wave simulation, is used for training and testing. The impacts of training strategy, initial-value algorithm, reconstruction distance, and measurement sampling density on model performance are analyzed. Results show that the proposed method significantly improves reconstruction accuracy, achieving an average relative error of 4.57% for electric field reconstruction and 2.97% for IPD estimation on the test dataset. Additionally, the effects of practical uncertainty factors, including probe misalignment, inter-probe coupling, and measurement noise, are quantitatively assessed.

Closed-form equations of diode input impedance and rectifying efficiency are presented and validated using Advanced Design System simulations. The matching network design of the proposed rectifier is based on the closed-form equations. The preliminary rectifying efficiency is predicted by the closed-form equations as well.

Abstract: Maximal extractable value opportunities often induce spam in Layer-2 blockchains: many identical transactions are submitted near simultaneously, most of which revert, wasting blockspace. We study Timeboost, a mechanism on Arbitrum that auctions a timestamp advantage, crucial under first-come first-served sequencing rules. We develop a game-theoretic model in which users choose the number of transaction copies to submit, and extend upon the baseline setting by modeling the Timeboost auction and subsequent transaction submission behavior. We show that Timeboost reduces spam and increases sequencer/DAO revenue in equilibrium relative to the baseline, transferring user payments from revert costs to auction bids. Empirically, we assemble mempool data from multiple Layer-2 networks, measuring spam via identical transactions submitted in narrow time intervals, and conduct an event study around Timeboost adoption on Arbitrum using other L2s as contemporaneous benchmarks. We find a decline in MEV-related spam and an increase in revenue on Arbitrum post-adoption, consistent with model predictions.

The algorithm is anytime and can be stopped early to find one or more ESSs. We experiment on an imperfect-information cancer signaling game as well as random games to demonstrate scalability.

Abstract: Concavity and its refinements underpin tractability in multiplayer games, where players independently choose actions to maximize their own payoffs which depend on other players' actions. In concave games, where players' strategy sets are compact and convex, and their payoffs are concave in their own actions, strong guarantees follow: Nash equilibria always exist and decentralized algorithms converge to equilibria. If the game is furthermore monotone, an even stronger guarantee holds: Nash equilibria are unique under strictness assumptions. Unfortunately, we show that certifying concavity or monotonicity is NP-hard, already for games where utilities are multivariate polynomials and compact, convex basic semialgebraic strategy sets -- an expressive class that captures extensive-form games with imperfect recall. On the positive side, we develop two hierarchies of sum-of-squares programs that certify concavity and monotonicity of a given game, and each level of the hierarchies can be solved in polynomial time. We show that almost all concave/monotone games are certified at some finite level of the hierarchies. Subsequently, we introduce SOS-concave/monotone games, which globally approximate concave/monotone games, and show that for any given game we can compute the closest SOS-concave/monotone game in polynomial time. Finally, we apply our techniques to canonical examples of imperfect recall extensive-form games.

Analytical calculation of the transition matrix of game as well as the first two moments of the distribution of $\varphi=N^+/N$, where $N^+$ is a number of players adhering to one of the two strategies, is presented. First two moments of the first hitting time distribution for sample trajectories corresponding to transition from a metastable and unstable states to a stable one are considered. A nontrivial dependence of these moments on $k$ for the decay of a metastable state is discussed. A presence of the minima at certain $k^*$ is attributed to a competition between $k$-dependent diffusion and restoring forces.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) necessitates novel monetization strategies, among which LLM-native advertising has emerged as a promising paradigm by naturally integrating advertisement within LLM-generated responses. However, this paradigm fundamentally shifts the auction object from discrete ad slots to the distribution over LLM outputs, posing new challenges for designing auction mechanisms. Existing mechanisms for LLM-native advertising adopt frameworks that decouple auction and generation, which either ignore externalities or require multiple LLM inferences for ad allocation, rendering them impractical for industrial scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-Auction, which to the best of our knowledge is the first learning-based generative auction mechanism that integrates auction and LLM generation for LLM-native advertising. By formulating the allocation optimization as a preference alignment problem between LLM outputs and the mechanism's objective which reflects both advertisers' expected value and user experience, we introduce Iterative Reward-Preference Optimization (IRPO) algorithm that alternately optimizes the reward model and the LLM. This approach enables the LLM to inherently model allocation externalities without any extra inference cost. We further identify the allocation monotonicity and continuity of LLM-Auction, which allows us to prove that a simple first-price payment rule exhibits favorable incentive properties. Additionally, we design an LLM-as-a-judge simulation environment to facilitate large-scale data construction and enable comprehensive quantitative evaluation of the mechanism's performance. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that LLM-Auction significantly outperforms existing baselines in allocation efficiency, while achieving the desired mechanism properties.

Abstract: Simple Clock Auctions (SCA) are a mechanism commonly used in spectrum auctions to sell lots of frequency bandwidths. We study such an auction with one player having access to perfect information against straightforward bidders. When the opponents' valuations satisfy the ordinary substitutes condition, we show that it is optimal to bid on a fixed lot overtime. In this setting, we consider a continuous-time version of the SCA auction in which the prices follow a differential inclusion with a piecewise-constant dynamics. We show that there exists a unique solution in the sense of Filippov. This guarantees that the continuous-time model coincides with the limit of the discrete-time auction when price increments tend to zero. Moreover, we show that the value function of this limit auction is piecewise linear (though possibly discontinuous). Finally, we illustrate these results by analyzing a simplified version of the multiband Australian spectrum auction of 2017.

Abstract: We study the problem of fairly allocating a set of $m$ goods among $n$ agents in the asymptotic setting, where each item's value for each agent is drawn from an underlying joint distribution. Prior works have shown that if this distribution is well-behaved, then an envy-free allocation exists with high probability when $m=Ω(n\log{n})$ [Dickerson et al., 2014]. Under the stronger assumption that item values are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) across agents, this requirement improves to $m=Ω(n\log{n}/\log{\log{n}})$, which is tight [Manurangsi and Suksompong, 2021]. However, these results rely on non-strategyproof mechanisms, such as maximum-welfare allocation or the round-robin algorithm, limiting their applicability in settings with strategic agents.
  In this work, we extend the theory to a broader, more realistic class of joint value distributions, allowing for correlations among agents, atomicity, and unequal probabilities of having the highest value for an item. We show that envy-free allocations continue to exist with a high probability when $m=Ω(n\log{n})$. More importantly, we give a new randomized mechanism that is truthful in expectation, efficiently implementable in polynomial time, and outputs envy-free allocations with high probability, answering an open question posed by [Manurangsi and Suksompong, 2017]. We further extend our mechanism to settings with asymptotic weighted fair division and multiple agent types and good types, proving new results in each case.

Abstract: The efficiency of modern machine intelligence depends on high accuracy with minimal computational cost. In spiking neural networks (SNNs), synaptic delays are crucial for encoding temporal structure, yet existing models treat them as fully trainable, unconstrained parameters, leading to large memory footprints, higher computational demand, and a departure from biological plausibility. In the brain, however, delays arise from physical distances between neurons embedded in space. Building on this principle, we introduce Spatial Spiking Neural Networks (SpSNNs), a framework in which neurons learn coordinates in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space and delays emerge from inter-neuron distances. This replaces per-synapse delay learning with position learning, substantially reducing parameter count while retaining temporal expressiveness. Across the Yin-Yang and Spiking Heidelberg Digits benchmarks, SpSNNs outperform SNNs with unconstrained delays despite using far fewer parameters. Performance consistently peaks in 2D and 3D networks rather than infinite-dimensional delay spaces, revealing a geometric regularization effect. Moreover, dynamically sparsified SpSNNs maintain full accuracy even at 90% sparsity, matching standard delay-trained SNNs while using up to 18x fewer parameters. Because learned spatial layouts map naturally onto hardware geometries, SpSNNs lend themselves to efficient neuromorphic implementation. Methodologically, SpSNNs compute exact delay gradients via automatic differentiation with custom-derived rules, supporting arbitrary neuron models and architectures. Altogether, SpSNNs provide a principled platform for exploring spatial structure in temporal computation and offer a hardware-friendly substrate for scalable, energy-efficient neuromorphic intelligence.

Abstract: Bayesian inference offers a principled account of information processing in natural agents. However, it remains an open question how neural mechanisms perform their abstract operations. We investigate a hypothesis where a distributed form of Bayesian inference, namely message passing on factor graphs, is performed by a simulated network of leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons. Specifically, we perform Gaussian belief propagation by encoding messages that come into factor nodes as spike-based signals, propagating these signals through a spiking neural network (SNN) and decoding the spike-based signal back to an outgoing message. Three core linear operations, equality (branching), addition, and multiplication, are realized in networks of leaky integrate-and-fire models. Validation against the standard sum-product algorithm shows accurate message updates, while applications to Kalman filtering and Bayesian linear regression demonstrate the framework's potential for both static and dynamic inference tasks. Our results provide a step toward biologically grounded, neuromorphic implementations of probabilistic reasoning.

Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is a promising waveform for future wireless communication systems. In this paper, we analyze the impact of receiver in-phase and quadrature (IQ) imbalance and residual carrier frequency offset (CFO) error on AFDM signals. Our analysis shows that the receiver IQ imbalance may not preserve the sparsity of the AFDM effective channel matrix because of the complex-conjugate operator of the discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT). Moreover, the residual CFO error causes energy leakage in the effective channel matrix in the affine domain. To mitigate these effects, we extend the linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) detector to handle the improper Gaussian noise arising from the receiver IQ imbalance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LMMSE detector effectively compensates for the receiver hardware impairments.

Abstract: Real-time location systems (RTLSs) are central to Industry 4.0 and emerging Industry 5.0, providing the spatiotemporal data required for asset tracking, workflow optimization, safety, and integration with WMS, MES, and digital twins. While large enterprises increasingly deploy RTLSs, adoption among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) remains limited. This paper examines whether cost and installation complexity are primary barriers to SME adoption. We position RTLSs within the broader Industry 4.0 and Logistics 4.0 landscape and summarize their operational value. We then synthesize evidence from the literature on technical, financial, and organizational constraints, with emphasis on infrastructure requirements, calibration effort, integration with legacy systems, and human factors. To complement this analysis, we report results from an online survey of sixteen manufacturing and technology professionals in Canada and the United States. Respondents report strong perceived value for real-time tracking but identify upfront cost, installation effort, integration difficulty, and reliance on multiple anchor nodes as dominant obstacles. Most indicate acceptable upfront investments below $10,000 and express a clear preference for low-infrastructure deployments with minimized anchor counts. Building on these findings, we outline design directions for SME-focused RTLSs, including wireless and modular architectures, cloud-managed and self-calibrating systems, standardized integration interfaces, and anchor-minimizing or anchor-free localization methods. Overall, the results show that limited SME adoption stems less from insufficient perceived value than from misalignment between current RTLS deployment models and SME resource constraints.

Abstract: Topology identification and inference of processes evolving over graphs arise in timely applications involving brain, transportation, financial, power, as well as social and information networks. This chapter provides an overview of graph topology identification and statistical inference methods for multidimensional relational data. Approaches for undirected links connecting graph nodes are outlined, going all the way from correlation metrics to covariance selection, and revealing ties with smooth signal priors. To account for directional (possibly causal) relations among nodal variables and address the limitations of linear time-invariant models in handling dynamic as well as nonlinear dependencies, a principled framework is surveyed to capture these complexities through judiciously selected kernels from a prescribed dictionary. Generalizations are also described via structural equations and vector autoregressions that can exploit attributes such as low rank, sparsity, acyclicity, and smoothness to model dynamic processes over possibly time-evolving topologies. It is argued that this approach supports both batch and online learning algorithms with convergence rate guarantees, is amenable to tensor (that is, multi-way array) formulations as well as decompositions that are well-suited for multidimensional network data, and can seamlessly leverage high-order statistical information.

Abstract: This work investigates exploiting the potential of pixel antennas, which are a reconfigurable antenna technology that can flexibly adjust the antenna characteristics through antenna coding, in multi-user transmissions. To that end, we propose a multi-user multi-input single-output (MISO) pixel antenna system, which deploys the pixel antenna at users, and develop the system model including pixel antenna with antenna coding and multi-user beamspace channels. Aiming at maximizing the sum rate performance, we first propose an algorithm to alternatively design the precoding at the transmitter and the antenna coding at users, which explores the performance boundary for the proposed multi-user MISO pixel antenna system. To reduce the computational complexity, we propose a codebook-based antenna coding design algorithm, where the antenna coder is online optimized from an offline codebook. To further enhance the computation efficiency, we propose a hierarchical codebook-based antenna coding design that uses a multi-layer hierarchical search to achieve a better performance-complexity trade-off. Simulation results show that, adopting the proposed algorithms, the multi-user MISO pixel antenna system can always outperform conventional multi-user MISO systems with fixed antennas. More importantly, results validate that the proposed (hierarchical) codebook-based algorithms can significantly reduce the computational complexity while maintaining a satisfactory sum rate performance.

Abstract: With the advent of the 6G era, Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) has attracted increasing attention. One representative of use cases is crowd flow estimation on outdoor streets. However, most existing studies have focused on indoor environments or vehicles, and demonstrations of outdoor crowd flow estimation using commercial LTE base station remain limited. This study addresses this use case and proposes an analysis of a crowd flow estimation method using Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) obtained from a commercial LTE base station. Specifically, pedestrian counts derived from a camera-based object recognition algorithm were associated with the variance of RSRP. The features obtained from the variance were quantitatively evaluated by combining a CatBoost regression model with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. Through this investigation, we clarified that an optimal variance window size for RSRP is 0.1 to 0.2 seconds and that enlarging the counting area increased the features obtained from the variance of RSRP, for machine learning. Consequently, this study is the first to quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of outdoor crowd flow estimation using commercial LTE, while also revealing the characteristic behavior of variance window size and counting area size in feature design.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel pilot scheme for multi-user uplink channel estimation in extra-large-scale massive MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems with extremely large aperture arrays (ELAA). The large aperture of ELAA introduces spatial non-stationarity, where far-apart users have significantly distinct visibility at the antennas, thereby reducing inter-user interference. This insight motivates our novel pilot scheme to group users with distinct visibility regions to share the same frequency subcarriers for channel estimation, so that more users can be served with reduced pilot overhead. Specifically, the proposed pilot scheme employs frequency-division multiplexing for inter-group channel estimation, while intra-group users -- benefiting from strong spatial orthogonality -- are distinguished by shifted cyclic codes, similar to code-division multiplexing. Additionally, we introduce a sub-array structured ELAA, where each sub-array is a traditional MIMO array and treated as spatial stationary, while the distances between sub-arrays can be significantly larger to achieve an expanded aperture. The channel support for sub-arrays features clustered sparsity in the antenna-delay domain and is modeled by a 2-dimensional (2-D) Markov random field (MRF). Based on this, we propose a low-complexity channel estimation algorithm within a turbo Bayesian inference framework that incorporates the 2-D MRF prior model. Simulations show that the proposed scheme and algorithm allow the XL-MIMO system to support more users, and deliver superior channel estimation performance.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. However, recent studies have shown that adversarial perturbations can severely compromise the performance of such models. To address this vulnerability, we propose Transformer-based Adversarial Defense for DOA estimation (T-ADD), a transformer-based defense method designed to counter adversarial attacks. To achieve a balance between robustness and estimation accuracy, we formulate the adversarial defense as a joint reconstruction task and introduce a tailored joint loss function. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with three state-of-the-art adversarial defense methods, the proposed T-ADD significantly mitigates the adverse effects of widely used adversarial attacks, leading to notable improvements in the adversarial robustness of the DOA model.

First, we propose a new neural network (NN)-based FD-DPD model, whose main idea is to use a hypernetwork (HN) to generate parameters for the output layer of the main NN based on the signal states. Then, we introduce how to effectively train the model with the help of time-domain (TD)-DPD. Experimental results show that the proposed model can achieve excellent performance, without requiring additional online training when signal states change.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems have emerged as a promising solution to improve spectrum efficiency and enable functional convergence. However, ensuring secure information transmission while maintaining high-quality sensing performance remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we investigate an integrated sensing and covert communication (ISCC) system, in which a base station (BS) simultaneously serves multiple downlink users and senses malicious targets that may act as both potential eavesdroppers (Eves) and wardens. We propose a novel symbol-level precoding (SLP)-based waveform design for ISCC that achieves covert communication intrinsically, without requiring additional transmission resources such as artificial noise. The proposed design integrates symbol shaping to enhance reliability for legitimate users and noise shaping to obscure transmission activities from the targets. For imperfect channel state information (CSI), the framework incorporates bounded uncertainty models for user channels and target angles, yielding a more robust design. The resulting ISCC waveform optimization problem is non-convex; to address this, we develop a low-complexity proximal distance algorithm (PDA) with closed-form updates under both PSK and QAM modulations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior covertness and sensing-communication performance with negligible degradation compared to traditional beamforming and conventional SLP approaches without noise-shaping mechanisms.

To close this gap, we publish three real-world wideband multi-antenna multi-open RAN radio unit (O-RU) CSI datasets from the 5G NR uplink channel: an indoor lab/office room dataset, an outdoor campus courtyard dataset, and a device classification dataset with six commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) user equipments (UEs). These datasets have been recorded using a software-defined 5G NR testbed based on NVIDIA Aerial RAN CoLab Over-the-Air (ARC-OTA) with COTS hardware, which we have deployed at ETH Zurich. We demonstrate the utility of these datasets for three CSI-based sensing tasks: neural UE positioning, channel charting in real-world coordinates, and closed-set device classification. For all these tasks, our results show high accuracy: neural UE positioning achieves 0.6cm (indoor) and 5.7cm (outdoor) mean absolute error, channel charting in real-world coordinates achieves 73cm mean absolute error (outdoor), and device classification achieves 99% (same day) and 95% (next day) accuracy. The CSI datasets, ground-truth UE position labels, CSI features, and simulation code are publicly available at https://caez.ethz.ch

Abstract: Frequency offsets-compensated least mean squares (FO-LMS) algorithm is a generic method for estimating a wireless channel under carrier and sampling frequency offsets when the transmitted signal is beforehand known to the receiver. The algorithm iteratively and explicitly adjusts its estimates of the channel and frequency offsets using stochastic gradient descent-based rules and the step sizes of these rules determine the learning rate and stability of the algorithm. Within the stability conditions, the choice of step sizes reflects a trade-off between the algorithm's ability to react to changes in the channel and the ability to minimize misadjustments caused by noise. This paper provides theoretical expressions to predict and optimize the tracking and misadjusment errors of FO-LMS when estimating channels and frequency offsets with known time-varying characteristics. This work also proposes a method to adjust the FO-LMS's step sizes based on the algorithm's performance when the time-varying characteristics are not known, which is more often the case in practice. Accuracy of the expressions and performance of the proposed variable step sizes algorithm are studied through simulations.

Abstract: Known-interference cancellation (KIC) in combination with cooperative jamming can be used to provide covertness and security to wireless communications at the physical layer. However, since the signal of interest (SI) of a wireless communication system acts as estimation noise, i.e., interference, to KIC, the SI limits the extent to which the known interference (KI) can be canceled and that in turn limits the throughput of the wireless communication system that is being hidden or secured. In this letter, we analyze a decision feedback-aided known-interference cancellation (DF-KIC) structure in which both the KI and SI are canceled iteratively and successively. Measurement results demonstrate that introducing decision feedback to KIC improves its KI cancellation capability and hence increases the wireless communication system's useful throughput, albeit at the expense of a higher computational load.

Abstract: We propose a low-complexity localization framework for uplink distributed MIMO (D-MIMO) systems, targeting the challenge of minimizing the highly spiky maximum-likelihood (ML) cost function that arises in sparsely deployed phasecoherent access points (APs) with narrowband transmission. In such systems, ML-based localization typically relies on dense grid search, incurring prohibitive computational complexity. To address this, we introduce phase-only localization (POLO), an approach that leverages differential carrier-phase measurements from selected APs to generate a compact set of candidate user positions. The ML cost function is then evaluated only at these candidates, reducing complexity significantly. A key challenge is to devise an AP selection mechanism that reduces the number of candidate points while maintaining reliable coverage. We propose two variants: POLO-I, which selects three APs to provide closed-form candidate positions with low computational cost, and POLO-II, which selects four APs using an alternative strategy that enhances coverage at marginally higher runtime. Comprehensive analytical and simulation results show that POLO achieves a favorable coverage-complexity trade-off, reducing cost by orders of magnitude relative to exhaustive grid search with only marginal loss in coverage. By characterizing this tradeoff under diverse AP configurations, we also provide practical guidelines for selecting between POLO-I and POLO-II depending on latency and coverage requirements.

Abstract: Covering spaces are a fundamental tool in algebraic topology because of the close relationship they bear with the fundamental groups of spaces. Indeed, they are in correspondence with the subgroups of the fundamental group: this is known as the Galois correspondence. In particular, the covering space corresponding to the trivial group is the universal covering, which is a "1-connected" variant of the original space, in the sense that it has the same homotopy groups, except for the first one which is trivial. In this article, we formalize this correspondence in homotopy type theory, a variant of Martin-Löf type theory in which types can be interpreted as spaces (up to homotopy). Along the way, we develop an n-dimensional generalization of covering spaces. Moreover, in order to demonstrate the applicability of our approach, we formally classify the covering of lens spaces and explain how to construct the Poincaré homology sphere.

Abstract: We address the problem of translating informal mathematical proofs expressed in natural language into formal proofs in Lean4 under a constrained computational budget. Our approach is grounded in two key insights. First, informal proofs tend to proceed via a sequence of logical transitions - often implications or equivalences - without explicitly specifying intermediate results or auxiliary lemmas. In contrast, formal systems like Lean require an explicit representation of each proof state and the tactics that connect them. Second, each informal reasoning step can be viewed as an abstract transformation between proof states, but identifying the corresponding formal tactics often requires nontrivial domain knowledge and precise control over proof context. To bridge this gap, we propose a two stage framework. Rather than generating formal tactics directly, we first extract a Chain of States (CoS), a sequence of intermediate formal proof states aligned with the logical structure of the informal argument. We then generate tactics to transition between adjacent states in the CoS, thereby constructing the full formal proof. This intermediate representation significantly reduces the complexity of tactic generation and improves alignment with informal reasoning patterns. We build dedicated datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluation, and introduce an interactive framework to support tactic generation from formal states. Empirical results show that our method substantially outperforms existing baselines, achieving higher proof success rates.

Abstract: State-of-the-art neural network verifiers operate by encoding neural
  network verification as constraint satisfaction problems. When
  dealing with standard piecewise-linear activation functions, such as
  ReLUs, verifiers typically employ branching heuristics that break a
  complex constraint satisfaction problem into multiple, simpler
  problems. The verifier's performance depends heavily on the order in
  which this branching is performed: a poor selection may give rise to
  exponentially many sub-problem, hampering scalability. Here, we
  focus on the setting where multiple verification queries must be
  solved for the same neural network. The core idea is to use past
  experience to make good branching decisions, expediting
  verification. We present a reinforcement-learning-based branching
  heuristic that achieves this, by applying a learning from
  demonstrations (DQfD) techniques. Our experimental
  evaluation demonstrates a substantial reduction in average
  verification time and in the average number of iterations required,
  compared to modern splitting heuristics. These results highlight
  the great potential of reinforcement learning in the context of
  neural network verification.

Abstract: Intuitionistic modal logics (IMLs) extend intuitionistic propositional logic with modalities such as the box and diamond connectives. Advances in the study of IMLs have inspired several applications in programming languages via the development of corresponding type theories with modalities. Until recently, IMLs with diamonds have been misunderstood as somewhat peculiar and unstable, causing the development of type theories with diamonds to lag behind type theories with boxes. In this article, we develop a family of typed-lambda calculi corresponding to sublogics of a peculiar IML with diamonds known as Lax logic. These calculi provide a modal logical foundation for various strong functors in typed-functional programming. We present possible-world and categorical semantics for these calculi and constructively prove normalization, equational completeness and proof-theoretic inadmissibility results. Our main results have been formalized using the proof assistant Agda.
