This study\nuses a novel text-based approach to measure the idea-level diffusion of social\nscience knowledge from the research domain to the journalism and policy-making\ndomains. By doing so, we expand the detection of knowledge diffusion beyond the\nmeasurements of direct references. Our study focuses on media effects theories\nas key research ideas in the field of communication science. Using 72,703\ndocuments (2000-2019) from three domains (i.e., research, journalism, and\npolicy-making) that mention these ideas, we count the mentions of these ideas\nin each domain, estimate their domain-specific contexts, and track and compare\ndifferences across domains and over time. Overall, we find that diffusion\npatterns and dynamics vary considerably between ideas, with some ideas\ndiffusing between other domains, while others do not. Based on the embedding\nregression approach, we compare contextualized meanings across domains and find\nthat the distances between research and policy are typically larger than\nbetween research and journalism. We also find that ideas largely shift roles\nacross domains - from being the theories themselves in research to sense-making\nin news to applied, administrative use in policy. Over time, we observe\nsemantic convergence mainly for ideas that are practically oriented. Our\nresults characterize the cross-domain diffusion patterns and dynamics of social\nscience knowledge at the idea level, and we discuss the implications for\nmeasuring knowledge diffusion beyond citations."}

Many\nestablished approaches (e.g., extrapolation and quasi-probability cancellation)\nimpose substantial execution or calibration overheads, while existing\nlearning-based methods have difficulty scaling to large and deep circuits. In\nthis research, we introduce QAGT-MLP: an attention-based graph transformer\ntailored for small- and large-scale quantum error mitigation (QEM). QAGT-MLP\nencodes each quantum circuit as a graph whose nodes represent gate instances\nand whose edges capture qubit connectivity and causal adjacency. A dual-path\nattention module extracts features around measured qubits at two scales or\ncontexts: 1) graph-wide global structural context; and 2) fine-grained local\nlightcone context. These learned representations are concatenated with\ncircuit-level descriptor features and the circuit noisy expected values, then\nthey are passed to a lightweight MLP to predict the noise-mitigated values. On\nlarge-scale 100-qubit Trotterized 1D Transverse-Field Ising Models -- TFIM\ncircuits -- the proposed QAGT-MLP outperformed state-of-the-art learning\nbaselines in terms of mean error and error variability, demonstrating strong\nvalidity and applicability in real-world QEM scenarios under matched shot\nbudgets. By using attention to fuse global structures with local lightcone\nneighborhoods, QAGT-MLP achieves high mitigation quality without the increasing\nnoise scaling or resource demand required by classical QEM pipelines, while\nstill offering a scalable and practical path to QEM in modern and future\nquantum workloads."}

We evaluate the framework on\ncanonical chaotic systems-the Mackey-Glass equation, the Lorenz system, and the\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. This novel formulation demonstrates that RFF-RC\nnot only achieves superior prediction accuracy but also yields robust attractor\nreconstructions and long-horizon forecasts.

In this work, we propose the first mixed-kernel and mixed-signal\nSVM design in FE, which unifies the advantages of both implementations and\nbalances the cost/accuracy trade-off. To that end, we introduce a\nco-optimization approach that trains our mixed-kernel SVMs and maps binary SVM\nclassifiers to the appropriate kernel (linear/RBF) and domain (digital/analog),\naiming to maximize accuracy whilst reducing the number of costly RBF\nclassifiers. Our designs deliver 7.7% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art\nsingle-kernel linear SVMs, and reduce area and power by 108x and 17x on average\ncompared to digital RBF implementations."}

We provide the following\ndynamic version of their kernel: Our data structure is initialized with an\n$n$-vertex planar graph $G$ in $O(n \\log n)$ amortized time, and, at\ninitialization, outputs a planar graph $K$ with $\\mathrm{OPT}(K) =\n\\mathrm{OPT}(G)$ and $|K| = O(\\mathrm{OPT}(G))$, where $\\mathrm{OPT}(\\cdot)$\ndenotes the size of a minimum dominating set. The graph $G$ can be updated by\ninsertions and deletions of edges and isolated vertices in $O(\\log n)$\namortized time per update, under the promise that it remains planar.

Given a\nproperty predictive model, in silico design typically involves training a\ngenerative model over the design space (e.g., protein sequence space) to\nconcentrate on designs with the desired properties. Distributional optimization\n-- which can be formalized as an estimation of distribution algorithm or as\nreinforcement learning policy optimization -- finds the generative model that\nmaximizes an objective function in expectation. Optimizing a distribution over\ndiscrete-valued designs is in general challenging because of the combinatorial\nnature of the design space.

This\npaper first establishes that the absence of key parameters, particularly\naircraft moments of inertia, makes conventional state-propagation filters\nfundamentally unsuitable for this application. This limitation necessitates a\ndecoupled, Equation-Error Method (EEM).

To overcome these dual challenges, we propose and\nvalidate the Constant-Gain Equation-Error Method (CG-EEM). This framework\nemploys a custom estimator with a constant, Kalman-like gain, which is\nperfectly suited to the stationary, low-signal-to-noise characteristics of\ncruise flight.

Electronic coupling analyses reveal optimized charge reactivity and\ntransport in systems with 20-25% OH functionalization. Topological\ncharacterization identified 477 bond critical points, confirming donor-acceptor\ninteractions with strong covalent contributions, particularly in highly\nfunctionalized systems. Radial distribution function profiles from molecular\ndynamics simulations demonstrate that functionalization promotes spatial\norganization on nanotube surfaces, increasing contact regions and reducing\nmolecular mobility. Systems with moderate interactions (CNT+OHx+G1 and\nCNT+OHx+G3) present environmentally and economically viable solutions, enabling\nadsorbent regeneration and reuse. The findings indicate that OH-functionalized\ncarbon nanotubes show significant promise for glyphosate detection and capture\napplications in environmental monitoring and remediation, regardless of the\npesticide's ionization state."}

To identify potential\nemitters at the atomic scale, annular dark-field scanning transmission electron\nmicroscopy (ADF-STEM) is frequently employed.

We\nfurther analyze the spatial correlations and establish that the system exhibits\nnon-reciprocal bunching (anti-bunching) in the presence of weak (strong)\ninteractions. Finally, we examine the growth of the Quantum Fisher Information,\n$F_Q$, with time, and demonstrate that $F_Q \\propto t^{\\alpha}$ where $\\alpha\n\\sim 3$. This feature persists for both one- and two-particle walks, thereby\ndemonstrating that this system can be employed as a quantum-enhanced sensor for\ndetecting weak forces."}

Here, we challenge this view by showing that their\nclassical observables can encode genuinely quantum features. In particular, we\ndemonstrate that the characteristic frequency shifts observed in such systems\nact as a signature of non-classical correlations and ground-state entanglement\nat zero temperature, specifically two-mode squeezing between the uncoupled\nmodes. From a complementary perspective, these two effects -- frequency shifts\nand squeezing -- represent the same underlying phenomenon expressed in\ndifferent mode bases. What appears as a spectral renormalization in one\ndescription manifests as entanglement in another. These shifts therefore can\nserve as an entanglement witness accessible via standard frequency\nmeasurements.

While effective to some extent, this approach inherits the\nlimitation of reference-based evaluation that ignores valuable information from\nthe source input. In machine translation (MT), recent progress has shown that\nneural metrics incorporating the source text achieve stronger correlation with\nhuman judgments. Extending this idea to ST, however, is not trivial because the\nsource is audio rather than text, and reliable transcripts or alignments\nbetween source and references are often unavailable. In this work, we conduct\nthe first systematic study of source-aware metrics for ST, with a particular\nfocus on real-world operating conditions where source transcripts are not\navailable. We explore two complementary strategies for generating textual\nproxies of the input audio, automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts, and\nback-translations of the reference translation, and introduce a novel two-step\ncross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm to address the alignment mismatch\nbetween synthetic sources and reference translations. Our experiments, carried\nout on two ST benchmarks covering 79 language pairs and six ST systems with\ndiverse architectures and performance levels, show that ASR transcripts\nconstitute a more reliable synthetic source than back-translations when word\nerror rate is below 20%, while back-translations always represent a\ncomputationally cheaper but still effective alternative. Furthermore, our\ncross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm enables robust use of source-aware MT\nmetrics in ST evaluation, paving the way toward more accurate and principled\nevaluation methodologies for speech translation."}

Leveraging this property, we\npropose an efficient pruning strategy that removes unnecessary DCT coefficients\nwith negligible or no loss in performance. Experimental results across\nclassification and implicit neural representation tasks confirm that ENNs\nachieve state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining a low number of parameters.\nFurthermore, up to 40% of the activation coefficients can be safely pruned,\nthanks to the orthogonality and bounded nature of the DCT basis. Overall, these\nfindings demonstrate that the ENN framework offers a principled integration of\nsignal processing concepts into neural network design, achieving a balanced\ntrade-off between expressiveness, compactness, and interpretability."}

We introduce a novel reservoir computing (RC) framework that\nintegrates time-delay embedding with Random Fourier Feature (RFF) mappings to\nconstruct a dynamical reservoir without the need for traditional recurrent\narchitectures. Unlike standard RC, which relies on high-dimensional recurrent\nconnectivity, the proposed RFF-RC explicitly approximates nonlinear kernel\ntransformations that uncover latent dynamical relations in the reconstructed\nphase space. This hybrid formulation offers two key advantages: (i) it provides\na principled way to approximate complex nonlinear interactions among delayed\ncoordinates, thereby enriching the effective dynamical representation of the\nreservoir, and (ii) it reduces reliance on manual reservoir hyperparameters\nsuch as spectral radius and leaking rate. We evaluate the framework on\ncanonical chaotic systems-the Mackey-Glass equation, the Lorenz system, and the\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. This novel formulation demonstrates that RFF-RC\nnot only achieves superior prediction accuracy but also yields robust attractor\nreconstructions and long-horizon forecasts.

This capability allows these models\nto engage in a step-by-step process of internal deliberation before generating\na final response. With the rapid transition to and adoption of these\n\"dual-state\" MLLMs, this work rigorously evaluated how the enhanced reasoning\nprocesses of these MLLMs impact model performance and reliability in clinical\ntasks. This paper evaluates the active \"thinking mode\" capabilities of two\nleading MLLMs, Seed1.5-VL and Gemini-2.5-Flash, for medical applications. We\nassessed their performance on four visual medical tasks using VQA-RAD and\nROCOv2 datasets. Our findings reveal that the improvement from activating the\nthinking mode remains marginal compared to the standard non-thinking mode for\nthe majority of the tasks. Their performance on complex medical tasks such as\nopen-ended VQA and medical image interpretation remains suboptimal,\nhighlighting the need for domain-specific medical data and more advanced\nmethods for medical knowledge integration."}

Methods such as CoOp and\nCoCoOp have shown that replacing handcrafted prompts with learnable vectors,\nknown as prompt learning, can result in improved performance. However, these\nmodels often struggle to generalize to entirely unseen categories. While\ntraditional zero-shot learning techniques benefit from various data\naugmentation strategies, prompt learning has primarily focused on text-based\nmodifications, leaving the potential of image-based augmentation largely\nunexplored. In this work, we explore how image-level augmentations,\nparticularly those that introduce attribute-specific variations, can support\nand enhance prompt learning. Our analysis examines the interaction between\nthese augmentations and soft prompt frameworks, revealing their potential to\nimprove generalization. We also identify a limitation in existing methods, such\nas CoCoOp, which do not provide explicit guidance for learning prompts that\nfocus on semantically meaningful visual features. To address this, we propose\nAdding Attributes to Prompt Learning, AAPL, a novel method that introduces\nadversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations\nintroduced by augmentation from class-relevant semantic representations. This\ndecoupling enables the learned prompts to concentrate on visually\ndiscriminative features that align with the target categories. We conduct\ncomprehensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets, and AAPL consistently\noutperforms existing methods across few-shot, zero-shot, cross-dataset, and\ndomain generalization settings.

Experiments were\ncarried out on a Codevintec CK-14e ASV in the towing tank of CNR-INM, under\nboth irregular and regular head-sea wave conditions. The ASV under\ninvestigation features a recessed moon pool, which induces nonlinear responses\ndue to sloshing, thereby increasing the modelling challenge. Data-driven\nreduced-order models were built from measurements of vessel motions and mooring\nloads. The HDMDc framework provided accurate deterministic predictions of\nvessel dynamics, while the Bayesian formulation enabled uncertainty-aware\ncharacterization of the model response by accounting for variability in\nhyperparameter selection. Validation against experimental data demonstrated\nthat both HDMDc and BHDMDc can predict the vessel's response to unseen regular\nand irregular wave excitations. In conclusion, the study shows that HDMDc-based\nROMs are a viable data-driven alternative for system identification,\ndemonstrating for the first time their generalization capability for a sea\ncondition different from the training set, achieving high accuracy in\nreproducing vessel dynamics."}

Existing research using contrastive, meta-learning, or data\naugmentation suffers from generalizability issues or lack of coherence between\ntext and target. Recent works leveraging large language models (LLMs) for ZSSD\nfocus either on improving unseen target-specific knowledge or generating\nexplanations for stance analysis. However, most of these works are limited by\ntheir over-reliance on explicit reasoning, provide coarse explanations that\nlack nuance, and do not explicitly model the reasoning process, making it\ndifficult to interpret the model's predictions. To address these issues, in our\nstudy, we develop a novel interpretable ZSSD framework, IRIS. We provide an\ninterpretable understanding of the attitude of the input towards the target\nimplicitly based on sequences within the text (implicit rationales) and\nexplicitly based on linguistic measures (explicit rationales). IRIS considers\nstance detection as an information retrieval ranking task, understanding the\nrelevance of implicit rationales for different stances to guide the model\ntowards correct predictions without requiring the ground-truth of rationales,\nthus providing inherent interpretability. In addition, explicit rationales\nbased on communicative features help decode the emotional and cognitive\ndimensions of stance, offering an interpretable understanding of the author's\nattitude towards the given target. Extensive experiments on the benchmark\ndatasets of VAST, EZ-STANCE, P-Stance, and RFD using 50%, 30%, and even 10%\ntraining data prove the generalizability of our model, benefiting from the\nproposed architecture and interpretable design."}
