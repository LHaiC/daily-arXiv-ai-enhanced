This lack of a unifying design necessitates recurrent hardware\ncustomization for each new control requirement, which limits the system's\nreconfigurability and impedes the path toward a scalable and unified digital\nmicroarchitecture.\n  Addressing these challenges, we propose Distributed-HISQ, featuring: (i)\nHISQ, A universal instruction set that redefines quantum control with a\nhardware-agnostic design. By decoupling from quantum operation semantics, HISQ\nprovides a unified language for control sequences, enabling a single\nmicroarchitecture to support various control methods and enhancing system\nreconfigurability. (ii) BISP, a booking-based synchronization protocol that can\npotentially achieve zero-cycle synchronization overhead. The feasibility and\nadaptability of Distributed-HISQ are validated through its implementation on a\ncommercial quantum control system targeting superconducting qubits. We\nperformed a comprehensive evaluation using a customized quantum software stack.\nOur results show that BISP effectively synchronizes multiple control boards,\nleading to a 22.8% reduction in average program execution time and a\n$\\sim$5$\\times$ reduction in infidelity when compared to an existing lock-step\nsynchronization scheme."}

However, measuring all of the parameters in the visible\nstate is experimentally demanding. We argue that the generalized bunching\nprobability -- which is the probability that all the input bosons arrive in a\ngiven subset of the output modes -- provides useful partial information about\nthe indistinguishability of the input bosons, by establishing that it is\nmonotonic with respect to certain partial orders of distinguishability of the\nbosons. As an intermediate result, we prove that if Lieb's\npermanental-dominance conjecture holds, then among states that are invariant\nunder permutations of the occupied visible modes, the generalized bunching\nprobability is maximized when the bosons are perfectly indistinguishable. As a\ncorollary, we show that if Lieb's conjecture holds, then the generalized\nbunching probability is monotonic with respect to the refinement partial order\non what we refer to as partially labelled states. We also prove,\nunconditionally, that for states such that the single-particle density matrix\nis the same for each particle, the Haar average of the generalized bunching\nprobability is Schur convex with respect to the eigenvalues of said\nsingle-particle density matrix. As an application of the Schur-convexity, we\nshow that when the single-particle density matrix is a Gibbs state, the mean\ngeneralized bunching probability serves as a thermometer."}

Existing approaches (Gaussian processes,\nBayesian neural networks, and quantile-based operators) require strong\ndistributional assumptions or yield conservative coverage. This work extends\nsplit conformal prediction to function spaces following a two step method. We\nfirst establish finite-sample coverage guarantees in a finite-dimensional space\nusing a discretization map in the output function space. Then these guarantees\nare lifted to the function-space by considering the asymptotic convergence as\nthe discretization is refined. To characterize the effect of resolution, we\ndecompose the conformal radius into discretization, calibration, and\nmisspecification components. This decomposition motivates a regression-based\ncorrection to transfer calibration across resolutions.

To address the above issues, we propose\nSparkUI-Parser, a novel end-to-end framework where higher localization\nprecision and fine-grained parsing capability of the entire interface are\nsimultaneously achieved.

Here we introduce\na control strategy for fast entangling gates in a scalable fluxonium\narchitecture, utilizing parametric modulation of the plasmon interaction. In\nthis architecture, fluxoniums are coupled via a tunable coupler, whose\ntransition frequency is flux-modulated to control the inter-fluxonium plasmon\ninteraction. A bSWAP-type interaction is activated by parametrically driving\nthe coupler at the sum frequency of the plasmon transitions of the two\nfluxoniums, resulting in the simultaneous excitation or de-excitation of both\nplasmon modes. This strategy therefore allow the transitions between\ncomputational states and non-computational plasmon states, enabling the\naccumulation of conditional phases on the computational subspace and\nfacilitating the realization of controlled-phase gates.

We argue that first-order\noptimizers exhibit an intrinsic frequency preference that significantly\nreshapes the optimization path. To address this, we propose Natural Spectral\nFusion (NSF): reframing training as controllable spectral coverage and\ninformation fusion rather than merely scaling step sizes. NSF has two core\nprinciples: treating the optimizer as a spectral controller that dynamically\nbalances low- and high-frequency information; and periodically reweighting\nfrequency bands at negligible cost, without modifying the model, data, or\ntraining pipeline. We realize NSF via a p-exponent extension of the\nsecond-moment term, enabling both positive and negative exponents, and\nimplement it through cyclic scheduling. Theory and experiments show that\nadaptive methods emphasize low frequencies, SGD is near-neutral, and negative\nexponents amplify high-frequency information. Cyclic scheduling broadens\nspectral coverage, improves cross-band fusion, and induces early\ndecision-boundary alignment, where accuracy improves even while loss remains\nhigh. Across multiple benchmarks, with identical learning-rate strategies and\nfixed hyperparameters, p-exponent cyclic scheduling consistently reduces test\nerror and demonstrates distinct convergence behavior; on some tasks, it matches\nbaseline accuracy with only one-quarter of the training cost.

Instead, it employs\nset-based state estimation with constrained zonotopes to capture biased,\nheavy-tailed uncertainties while maintaining bounded estimation errors. To\nimprove computational efficiency, the robust MPC is reformulated as a linear\nprogram (LP), using a Minkowski-Lyapunov-based cost function with an added\nslack variable to prevent degenerate solutions.

Recognizing that accurate\nuncertainty quantification of the perception module is essential for safe\nfeedback control, our approach departs from the conventional assumption of\nzero-mean noise quantification of the perception error. Instead, it employs\nset-based state estimation with constrained zonotopes to capture biased,\nheavy-tailed uncertainties while maintaining bounded estimation errors. To\nimprove computational efficiency, the robust MPC is reformulated as a linear\nprogram (LP), using a Minkowski-Lyapunov-based cost function with an added\nslack variable to prevent degenerate solutions. Closed-loop stability is\nensured through Minkowski-Lyapunov inequalities and contractive zonotopic\ninvariant sets. The largest stabilizing terminal set and its corresponding\nfeedback gain are then derived via an ellipsoidal approximation of the\nzonotopes. The proposed framework is validated through both simulations and\nhardware experiments on an omnidirectional mobile robot along with a camera and\na convolutional neural network-based perception module implemented within a\nROS2 framework.

While effective, this approach encounters a\nsignificant bottleneck as computation increases, where further computation\noffers only marginal performance gains. We argue this ceiling is not an\ninherent limit of the model's capability but a flaw in the scaling strategy\nitself, a phenomenon we term \"Tunnel Vision\", where a model's imperfect initial\nsteps lock it into a suboptimal reasoning path. To overcome this, we introduce\na new scaling paradigm: native thought parallelism. We present ParaThinker, an\nend-to-end framework that trains an LLM to generate multiple, diverse reasoning\npaths in parallel and synthesize them into a superior final answer. By\nexploring different lines of thoughts simultaneously, ParaThinker effectively\nsidesteps the Tunnel Vision issue and unlocks the model's latent reasoning\npotential. Our approach demonstrates that scaling compute in parallel (width)\nis a more effective and efficient way to superior reasoning than simply scaling\nsequentially (depth). On challenging reasoning benchmarks, ParaThinker achieves\nsubstantial accuracy improvements over sequential LLMs (12.3% for 1.5B and 7.5%\nfor 7B models on average with 8 parallel paths), while adding only negligible\nlatency overhead (7.1%).

While recent progress has\nfocused on scaling Language and Agent models, the development of sophisticated,\nexplicit World Models remains a key bottleneck, particularly for complex,\nlong-horizon multi-agent tasks. In domains such as robotic soccer, agents\ntrained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but\nstructurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces\nand sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in\ndeveloping capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an\nexplicit, hierarchical World Model.

Drawing evidence from a systematic review of\n2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend\ntowards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL).

In this study, we show that,\nwhen an LLM is uncertain, the patterns of disagreement among its multiple\ngenerated responses contain rich clues about the underlying cause of\nuncertainty. To illustrate this point, we collect multiple responses from a\ntarget LLM and employ an auxiliary LLM to analyze their patterns of\ndisagreement. The auxiliary model is tasked to reason about the likely source\nof uncertainty, such as whether it stems from ambiguity in the input question,\na lack of relevant knowledge, or both. In cases involving knowledge gaps, the\nauxiliary model also identifies the specific missing facts or concepts\ncontributing to the uncertainty. In our experiment, we validate our framework\non AmbigQA, OpenBookQA, and MMLU-Pro, confirming its generality in diagnosing\ndistinct uncertainty sources. Such diagnosis shows the potential for relevant\nmanual interventions that improve LLM performance and reliability."}

Using automated\nextraction pipelines for popular public models (e.g., GPT-4.5/5, You.com,\nPerplexity, Copilot/Bing, Gemini) and an LLM-judge with validated agreement to\nhuman raters, we evaluate both web-search engines and deep-research\nconfigurations. Our findings show that generative search engines and deep\nresearch agents frequently produce one-sided, highly confident responses on\ndebate queries and include large fractions of statements unsupported by their\nown listed sources. Deep-research configurations reduce overconfidence and can\nattain high citation thoroughness, but they remain highly one-sided on debate\nqueries and still exhibit large fractions of unsupported statements, with\ncitation accuracy ranging from 40--80% across systems."}

Using a curated \\textit{Diagnostic Prompt Suite} and an\ninnovative, automated evaluation pipeline where a powerful LLM acts as an\nimpartial judge, we analyze eighteen models across capability tiers. Our\nresults reveal a critical divergence in the LLM landscape: while core\ncapabilities like abstract and causal reasoning are converging among top\nmodels, alignment-related behaviors such as sycophancy and semantic robustness\nvary dramatically. We further document a cross-model default persona clustering\n(ISTJ/ESTJ) that likely reflects common alignment incentives.

We provide finite-sample performance guarantees for the\nentry-wise estimation of a low-rank approximation of the shifted successor\nmeasure from sampled entries.

However, existing diffusion parallelism\ninference schemes often underutilize resources in heterogeneous multi-GPU\nenvironments, where varying hardware capabilities or background tasks cause\nworkload imbalance. This paper introduces Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion\nInference (STADI), a novel framework to accelerate diffusion model inference in\nsuch settings. At its core is a hybrid scheduler that orchestrates fine-grained\nparallelism across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Temporally, STADI\nintroduces a novel computation-aware step allocator applied after warmup\nphases, using a least-common-multiple-minimizing quantization technique to\nreduce denoising steps on slower GPUs and execution synchronization. To further\nminimize GPU idle periods, STADI executes an elastic patch parallelism\nmechanism that allocates variably sized image patches to GPUs according to\ntheir computational capability, ensuring balanced workload distribution through\na complementary spatial mechanism. Extensive experiments on both\nload-imbalanced and heterogeneous multi-GPU clusters validate STADI's efficacy,\ndemonstrating improved load balancing and mitigation of performance\nbottlenecks.

ODKE+ dynamically generates\nontology snippets tailored to each entity type to align extractions with schema\nconstraints, enabling scalable, type-consistent fact extraction across 195\npredicates. The system supports batch and streaming modes, processing over 9\nmillion Wikipedia pages and ingesting 19 million high-confidence facts with\n98.8% precision. ODKE+ significantly improves coverage over traditional\nmethods, achieving up to 48% overlap with third-party KGs and reducing update\nlag by 50 days on average. Our deployment demonstrates that LLM-based\nextraction, grounded in ontological structure and verification workflows, can\ndeliver trustworthiness, production-scale knowledge ingestion with broad\nreal-world applicability.

However, these models struggle in\nadverse weather conditions where visual ambiguity is high, largely due to their\nlack of uncertainty quantification. Inspired by progress in medical imaging,\nwhere uncertainty-aware training has improved reliability in ambiguous cases,\nwe investigate two approaches to enhance segmentation robustness for autonomous\ndriving. First, we introduce a multi-step finetuning procedure for SAM2 that\nincorporates uncertainty metrics directly into the loss function, improving\noverall scene recognition. Second, we adapt the Uncertainty-Aware Adapter\n(UAT), originally designed for medical image segmentation, to driving contexts.\nWe evaluate both methods on CamVid, BDD100K, and GTA driving datasets.\nExperiments show that UAT-SAM outperforms standard SAM in extreme weather,\nwhile SAM2 with uncertainty-aware loss achieves improved performance across\ndiverse driving scenes.

Instead, it employs\nset-based state estimation with constrained zonotopes to capture biased,\nheavy-tailed uncertainties while maintaining bounded estimation errors. To\nimprove computational efficiency, the robust MPC is reformulated as a linear\nprogram (LP), using a Minkowski-Lyapunov-based cost function with an added\nslack variable to prevent degenerate solutions. Closed-loop stability is\nensured through Minkowski-Lyapunov inequalities and contractive zonotopic\ninvariant sets.

World models have found broad\napplications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving,\nentertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will\neffectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information\nabout the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has\nenabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged\nadvanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent\nadvances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on\nuser instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing\nLatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that\nstreamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld\nleverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering\nengine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed\nframework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal\ninputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents,\nfeaturing competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics\nsimulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to\nevaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene\nlayout generation and visual fidelity.

We systematically delineate the\ndesign space of decay mechanisms across four pivotal dimensions:\nparameterization strategy, which refers to the computational methodology for\ndecay; parameter sharing, which involves the utilization of supplementary\nparameters for decay computation; decay granularity, comparing scalar versus\nvector-based decay; and compatibility with relative positional encoding\nmethods, such as Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE).

Firstly, the design of the parameterization strategy\nfor decay requires meticulous consideration. Our findings indicate that\neffective configurations are typically confined to a specific range of\nparameters. Secondly, parameter sharing cannot be used arbitrarily, as it may\ncause decay values to be too large or too small, thereby significantly\nimpacting performance. Thirdly, under identical parameterization strategies,\nscalar decay generally underperforms compared to its vector-based counterpart.\nHowever, in certain scenarios with alternative parameterization strategies,\nscalar decay may unexpectedly surpass vector decay in efficacy. Lastly, our\nanalysis reveals that RoPE, a commonly employed relative positional encoding\nmethod, typically fails to provide tangible benefits to the majority of linear\nattention mechanisms."}

This position paper argues that the next frontier in\ndeveloping capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an\nexplicit, hierarchical World Model. We contend that this is best achieved\nthrough hierarchical scaffolding, where complex goals are decomposed into\nstructured, manageable subgoals. Drawing evidence from a systematic review of\n2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend\ntowards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL). These approaches implicitly or explicitly\nconstruct a task-based world model to guide agent learning. We then propose a\nparadigm shift: leveraging Large Language Models to dynamically generate this\nhierarchical scaffold, effectively using language to structure the World Model\non the fly. This language-driven world model provides an intrinsic curriculum,\ndense and meaningful learning signals, and a framework for compositional\nlearning, enabling Agent Models to acquire sophisticated, strategic behaviors\nwith far greater sample efficiency. By building environments with explicit,\nlanguage-configurable task layers, we can bridge the gap between low-level\nreactive behaviors and high-level strategic team play, creating a powerful and\ngeneralizable framework for training the next generation of intelligent agents."}

To address the above issues, we propose\nSparkUI-Parser, a novel end-to-end framework where higher localization\nprecision and fine-grained parsing capability of the entire interface are\nsimultaneously achieved.
