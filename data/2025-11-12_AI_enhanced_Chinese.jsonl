Compact models are essential for analyzing the circuit and system-level performance of experimental RRAM devices. However, most existing RRAM compact models rely on multiple fitting parameters to reproduce the device I-V characteristics, and in most cases, as the parameters are not directly related to measurable quantities, their extraction requires extensive manual tuning, making the process time-consuming and limiting adaptability across different devices. This work presents an automated framework for extracting the fitting parameters of the widely used Stanford RRAM model directly from the device I-V characteristics. The framework employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a synthetic dataset to generate initial parameter estimates, which are then refined through three heuristic optimization blocks that minimize errors via adaptive binary search in the parameter space. We evaluated the framework using four key NVM metrics: set voltage, reset voltage, hysteresis loop area, and low resistance state (LRS) slope. Benchmarking against RRAM device characteristics derived from previously reported Stanford model fits, other analytical models, and experimental data shows that the framework achieves low error across diverse device characteristics, offering a fast, reliable, and robust solution for RRAM modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6RRAM\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528CNN\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u4ece\u5668\u4ef6I-V\u7279\u6027\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cdRRAM\u5668\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684RRAM\u7d27\u51d1\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u624b\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u62df\u5408\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u5668\u4ef6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7535\u8def\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684CNN\u63d0\u4f9b\u521d\u59cb\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5728NVM\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u5f00\u542f/\u5173\u95ed\u7535\u538b\u3001\u6ede\u540e\u56de\u7ebf\u9762\u79ef\u3001\u4f4e\u963b\u6001\u659c\u7387\uff09\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u81ea\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aRRAM\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

However, these systems remain vulnerable to presentation attacks (PAs), which can significantly compromise their reliability. In this work, we introduce a new dataset focused on a novel and realistic presentation attack instrument called Nylon Face Masks (NFMs), designed to simulate advanced 3D spoofing scenarios. NFMs are particularly concerning due to their elastic structure and photorealistic appearance, which enable them to closely mimic the victim's facial geometry when worn by an attacker. To reflect real-world smartphone-based usage conditions, we collected the dataset using an iPhone 11 Pro, capturing 3,760 bona fide samples from 100 subjects and 51,281 NFM attack samples across four distinct presentation scenarios involving both humans and mannequins.

To support effective trading, signaling mechanisms provide participants with information about data products before transactions, enabling informed decisions and facilitating trading. However, due to the inherent free-duplication nature of data, commonly practiced signaling methods face a dilemma between privacy and reliability, undermining the effectiveness of signals in guiding decision-making.\n  To address this, this paper explores the benefits and develops a non-TCP-based construction for a desirable signaling mechanism that simultaneously ensures privacy and reliability. We begin by formally defining the desirable utility signaling mechanism and proving its ability to prevent suboptimal decisions for both participants and facilitate informed data trading. To design a protocol to realize its functionality, we propose leveraging maliciously secure multi-party computation (MPC) to ensure the privacy and robustness of signal computation and introduce an MPC-based hash verification scheme to ensure input reliability.

Specifically, we jointly address two questions (Q1) Survivability: following a disturbance and the subsequent primary frequency response, can the system settle into a healthy steady state (feasible with an acceptable frequency deviation $\u0394f$)? (Q2) Dominant Vulnerability: if found unstable, what critical vulnerabilities create instability and/or full collapse? To address these questions, we first augment steady-state power flow states to include frequency-dependent governor relationships (i.e., governor power flow). Afterwards, we propose a frequency-aware sparse optimization that finds the minimal set of bus locations with measurable compensations (corrective actions) to enforce power balance and maintain frequency within predefined/acceptable bounds. We evaluate our method on standard transmission systems to empirically validate its ability to localize dominant sources of vulnerabilities. For a 1354-bus large system, our method detects compensations to only four buses under N-1 generation outage (3424.8 MW) while enforcing a maximum allowable steady-state frequency drop of 0.06 Hz (otherwise, frequency drops by nearly 0.08 Hz). We further validate the scalability of our method, requiring less than four minutes to obtain sparse solutions for the 1354-bus system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u7a33\u6001\u89d2\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u9891\u7387\u5931\u7a33\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u7684\u77ac\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u9891\u7387\u5931\u7a33\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8106\u5f31\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u7a33\u6001\u6f6e\u6d41\u72b6\u6001\u4ee5\u5305\u542b\u4e0e\u9891\u7387\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8c03\u901f\u5668\u5173\u7cfb\uff08\u5373\u8c03\u901f\u5668\u6f6e\u6d41\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u7a00\u758f\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u627e\u51fa\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u8865\u507f\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f3a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u529f\u7387\u5e73\u8861\u5e76\u4f7f\u9891\u7387\u7ef4\u6301\u5728\u9884\u5b9a\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u3002", "result": "\u57281354\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u8f93\u7535\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\uff0cN-1\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u6545\u969c\uff083424.8\u5146\u74e6\uff09\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u8865\u507f\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6700\u5927\u5141\u8bb8\u7a33\u6001\u9891\u7387\u964d\u5e45\u9650\u5236\u57280.06\u8d6b\u5179\uff08\u5426\u5219\u9891\u7387\u5c06\u4e0b\u964d\u8fd10.08\u8d6b\u5179\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u5230\u56db\u5206\u949f\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5728\u7a33\u6001\u4e0b\u8bc6\u522b\u9891\u7387\u5931\u7a33\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u51c6\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8106\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u4e3a\u7535\u7f51\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fd0\u884c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials present a particularly promising platform due to their robustness against stray fields and their potential for exceptional DW velocities. Among various proposed driving mechanisms, coherent spin waves could potentially propel AFM DWs to the magnon group velocity while minimizing dissipation from Joule heating. However, experimental realization has remained elusive due to the dual challenges of generating coherent AFM spin waves near isolated mobile AFM DWs and simultaneously measuring high-speed DW dynamics. Here we experimentally realize an approach where ultrafast laser pulses generate coherent spin waves that drive AFM DWs and develop a technique to directly map the spatiotemporal DW dynamics. Using the room-temperature AFM insulator Sr$_2$Cu$_3$O$_4$Cl$_2$, we observe AFM DW motion with record-high velocities up to ~50 km/s. Remarkably, the direction of DW propagation is controllable through both the pump laser helicity and the sign of the DW winding number. This bidirectional control can be theoretically explained, and numerically reproduced, by the DW dynamics induced by coherent spin waves of the in-plane magnon mode - a phenomenon unique to magnets with an easy-plane anisotropy.

Traditional deterministic approaches often ignore geological uncertainty, leading to suboptimal and potentially infeasible production schedules. Chance constraints allow modeling of stochastic components by ensuring probabilistic constraints are satisfied with high probability. This paper presents a bi-objective formulation of the OPMSP that simultaneously maximizes expected net present value and minimizes scheduling risk, independent of the confidence level required for the constraint. Solutions are represented using integer encoding, inherently satisfying reserve constraints. We introduce a domain-specific greedy randomized initialization and a precedence-aware period-swap mutation operator. We integrate these operators into three multi-objective evolutionary algorithms: the global simple evolutionary multi-objective optimizer (GSEMO), a mutation-only variant of multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D), and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). We compare our bi-objective formulation against the single-objective approach, which depends on a specific confidence level, by analyzing mine deposits consisting of up to 112 687 blocks. Results demonstrate that the proposed bi-objective formulation yields more robust and balanced trade-offs between economic value and risk compared to single-objective, confidence-dependent approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8003\u8651\u5730\u8d28\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u9732\u5929\u77ff\u751f\u4ea7\u6392\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5927\u5316\u9884\u671f\u51c0\u73b0\u503c\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u751f\u4ea7\u98ce\u9669\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9732\u5929\u77ff\u751f\u4ea7\u6392\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u5730\u8d28\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b21\u4f18\u751a\u81f3\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u8ba1\u5212\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5927\u5316\u9884\u671f\u51c0\u73b0\u503c\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6574\u6570\u7f16\u7801\u8868\u793a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8d2a\u5a6a\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u7684\u5468\u671f\u4ea4\u6362\u53d8\u5f02\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4e09\u79cd\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08GSEMO\u3001MOEA/D\u3001NSGA-II\uff09\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u5355\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u7f6e\u4fe1\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u66f4\u52a0\u7a33\u5065\u548c\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bd4\u5355\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u5730\u8d28\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

Codes will be released later", "summary": "Three-dimensional (3D) point clouds are increasingly used in applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and virtual reality (VR). Point-based neural networks (PNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in point cloud analysis, originally targeting small-scale inputs. However, as PNNs evolve to process large-scale point clouds with hundreds of thousands of points, all-to-all computation and global memory access in point cloud processing introduce substantial overhead, causing $O(n^2)$ computational complexity and memory traffic where n is the number of points}. Existing accelerators, primarily optimized for small-scale workloads, overlook this challenge and scale poorly due to inefficient partitioning and non-parallel architectures. To address these issues, we propose FractalCloud, a fractal-inspired hardware architecture for efficient large-scale 3D point cloud processing. FractalCloud introduces two key optimizations: (1) a co-designed Fractal method for shape-aware and hardware-friendly partitioning, and (2) block-parallel point operations that decompose and parallelize all point operations. A dedicated hardware design with on-chip fractal and flexible parallelism further enables fully parallel processing within limited memory resources. Implemented in 28 nm technology as a chip layout with a core area of 1.5 $mm^2$, FractalCloud achieves 21.7x speedup and 27x energy reduction over state-of-the-art accelerators while maintaining network accuracy, demonstrating its scalability and efficiency for PNN inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "FractalCloud\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u5206\u5f62\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5f62\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5757\u5e76\u884c\u70b9\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a213D\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8621.7\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u548c27\u500d\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PNN\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u70b9\u4e91\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u56e0\u4f4e\u6548\u5206\u533a\u548c\u975e\u5e76\u884c\u67b6\u6784\u800c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u5206\u5f62\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784FractalCloud\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u5206\u533a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u6240\u6709\u70b9\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5757\u5e76\u884c\u70b9\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u572828nm\u5de5\u827a\u4e0b\uff0cFractalCloud\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u9762\u79ef\u4e3a1.5 mm\u00b2\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8621.7\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u548c27\u500d\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "FractalCloud\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5168\u5e76\u884c\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728PNN\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u9ad8\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

We introduce a new data fusion framework, termed the method of double moments (MoDM), which reconstructs molecular structures from two instances of the second-order moment of projection images obtained under distinct orientation distributions--one uniform, the other non-uniform and unknown. We prove that these moments generically uniquely determine the underlying structure, up to a global rotation and reflection, and we develop a convex-relaxation-based algorithm that achieves accurate recovery using only second-order statistics. Our results demonstrate the advantage of collecting and modeling multiple datasets under different experimental conditions, illustrating that leveraging dataset diversity can substantially enhance reconstruction quality in computational imaging tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoDM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8c\u6b21\u77e9\u7684\u51b7\u51bb\u7535\u955c\u4e09\u7ef4\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u5efa\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u4ece\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u5411\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7cbe\u786e\u6062\u590d\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u51b7\u51bb\u7535\u955c\u6280\u672f\u5728\u4ece\u5608\u6742\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u4e09\u7ef4\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u4ece\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201c\u53cc\u77e9\u6cd5\u201d\uff08MoDM\uff09\u7684\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u5411\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u77e9\u6765\u91cd\u5efa\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u51f8\u677e\u5f1b\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ec5\u7528\u4e8c\u6b21\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u6062\u590d\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e8c\u6b21\u77e9\u53ef\u4ee5\u552f\u4e00\u786e\u5b9a\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u53cd\u5c04\u4e0b\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u51f8\u677e\u5f1b\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8c\u6b21\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6062\u590d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u540c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u5728\u4e8e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Traditional approaches often rely on volumetric representations guided by generative models, but these methods require extensive volumetric rendering queries, leading to slow training. Alternatively, surface-based representations offer faster optimization through differentiable rasterization, yet they are typically limited by vertex count, restricting mesh resolution and scalability when combined with generative priors. Moreover, integrating generative priors into physically based human avatar modeling remains largely unexplored. To address these challenges, we introduce DIS (Deep Inverse Shading), a unified framework for high-fidelity, relightable avatar reconstruction that incorporates generative priors into a coherent surface representation. DIS centers on a mesh-based model that serves as the target for optimizing both surface and material details. The framework fuses multi-view 2D generative surface normal predictions, rich in detail but often inconsistent, into the central mesh using a normal conversion module. This module converts generative normal outputs into per-triangle surface offsets via differentiable rasterization, enabling the capture of fine geometric details beyond sparse vertex limitations. Additionally, DIS integrates a de-shading module to recover accurate material properties. This module refines albedo predictions by removing baked-in shading and back-propagates reconstruction errors to optimize the geometry. Through joint optimization of geometry and material appearance, DIS achieves physically consistent, high-quality reconstructions suitable for accurate relighting.

State-of-the-art SAT solvers rely heavily on inherently sequential conflict-driven search algorithms that offer powerful heuristics but limit the amount of parallelism that could otherwise enable significantly more scalable SAT solving. Inspired by neural network training, we formulate the SAT problem as a binarized matrix-matrix multiplication layer that could be optimized using a differentiable objective function. Enabled by this encoding, we combine the strengths of parallel differentiable optimization and sequential search to accelerate SAT on a hybrid GPU-CPU system. In this system, the GPUs leverage parallel differentiable solving to rapidly evaluate SAT clauses and use gradients to stochastically explore the solution space and optimize variable assignments. Promising partial assignments generated by the GPUs are post-processed on many CPU threads which exploit conflict-driven sequential search to further traverse the solution subspaces and identify complete assignments.

However, GNN training often relies on expensive, high-performance computing platforms, limiting accessibility for many tasks. Profiling of representative GNN workloads indicates that substantial efficiency gains are possible on resource-constrained devices by fully exploiting available resources. This paper introduces A3GNN, a framework for affordable, adaptive, and automatic GNN training on heterogeneous CPU-GPU platforms. It improves resource usage through locality-aware sampling and fine-grained parallelism scheduling. Moreover, it leverages reinforcement learning to explore the design space and achieve pareto-optimal trade-offs among throughput, memory footprint, and accuracy.

Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation has emerged as a robust waveform for high-mobility and doubly dispersive channels, outperforming OFDM under strong Doppler. However, the most studied multicarrier OTFS (MC-OTFS) is not easily predictable because the input-output (I$/$O) relation is not given by (twisted) convolution. Recently, the Zak-transform based OTFS (Zak-OTFS or OTFS 2$.$0) was proposed, which provides a single domain delay Doppler (DD) processing framework with predictable I$/$O behavior. This paper presents one of the first over-the-air (OTA) demonstrations of Zak-OTFS at mmWave frequencies. We design a complete Zak-OTFS based mmWave OTA system featuring root-raised-cosine (RRC) filtering for enhanced DD-domain predictability, higher-order modulations up to 16-QAM, and a low-overhead preamble for synchronization. A comprehensive signal model incorporating carrier frequency offset (CFO) and timing impairments is developed, showing these effects can be jointly captured within the effective DD-domain channel. Experimental validation on the COSMOS testbed confirms the feasibility and robustness of Zak-OTFS under realistic mmWave conditions, highlighting its potential for efficient implementations in beyond-5G and 6G systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, to unlock such multimodal potential, robots need to learn the correlations between an object's visual appearance and the sound it generates when they interact with it. Such an active sensorimotor experience requires new interaction capabilities, representations, and exploration methods to guide the robot in efficiently building increasingly rich audiovisual knowledge. In this work, we present CAVER, a novel robot that builds and utilizes rich audiovisual representations of objects. CAVER includes three novel contributions: 1) a novel 3D printed end-effector, attachable to parallel grippers, that excites objects' audio responses, 2) an audiovisual representation that combines local and global appearance information with sound features, and 3) an exploration algorithm that uses and builds the audiovisual representation in a curiosity-driven manner that prioritizes interacting with high uncertainty objects to obtain good coverage of surprising audio with fewer interactions. We demonstrate that CAVER builds rich representations in different scenarios more efficiently than several exploration baselines, and that the learned audiovisual representation leads to significant improvements in material classification and the imitation of audio-only human demonstrations. https://caver-bot.github.io/", "AI": {"tldr": "\u673a\u5668\u4ebaCAVER\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u542c\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u7269\u4f53\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u6a21\u4eff\u97f3\u9891\u6f14\u793a\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u58f0\u97f3\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u7269\u4f53\u89c6\u89c9\u5916\u89c2\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u58f0\u97f3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002\u8fd9\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u6784\u5efa\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u89c6\u542c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCAVER\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u70b9\uff1a1\uff09\u4e00\u4e2a3D\u6253\u5370\u7684\u672b\u7aef\u6267\u884c\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6fc0\u53d1\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u58f0\u97f3\u54cd\u5e94\uff1b2\uff09\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u5916\u89c2\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u53ca\u58f0\u97f3\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u89c6\u542c\u8868\u793a\uff1b3\uff09\u4e00\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u89c6\u542c\u8868\u793a\u7684\u3001\u4ee5\u597d\u5947\u5fc3\u4e3a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u4e0e\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u83b7\u5f97\u4ee4\u4eba\u60ca\u8bb6\u7684\u58f0\u97f3\u8986\u76d6\u3002", "result": "CAVER\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u57fa\u7ebf\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u89c6\u542c\u8868\u793a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6750\u6599\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u6a21\u4eff\u4ec5\u6709\u97f3\u9891\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u793a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "CAVER\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u3001\u89c6\u542c\u8868\u793a\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u7269\u4f53\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

The adjustable hard settings of such systems require a flexible soft planning mechanism that enables realtime production planning and scheduling amid the existing complexity and variability in their configuration settings. This study explores the application of multi agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for dynamic scheduling in soft planning of the RMS settings. In the proposed framework, deep Qnetwork (DQN) agents trained in centralized training learn optimal job machine assignments in real time while adapting to stochastic events such as machine breakdowns and reconfiguration delays. The model also incorporates a negotiation with an attention mechanism to enhance state representation and improve decision focus on critical system features. Key DQN enhancements including prioritized experience replay, nstep returns, double DQN and soft target update are used to stabilize and accelerate learning. Experiments conducted in a simulated RMS environment demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms baseline heuristics in reducing makespan and tardiness while improving machine utilization. The reconfigurable manufacturing environment was extended to simulate realistic challenges, including machine failures and reconfiguration times. Experimental results show that while the enhanced DQN agent is effective in adapting to dynamic conditions, machine breakdowns increase variability in key performance metrics such as makespan, throughput, and total tardiness. The results confirm the advantages of applying the MARL mechanism for intelligent and adaptive scheduling in dynamic reconfigurable manufacturing environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MARL\uff09\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u5236\u9020\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08RMS\uff09\u7684\u8f6f\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u968f\u673a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u9274\u4e8e\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u5236\u9020\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08RMS\uff09\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u5e02\u573a\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u548c\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u4e2d\u65ad\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u8f6f\u89c4\u5212\u673a\u5236\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u751f\u4ea7\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5176\u914d\u7f6e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u53d8\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6Q\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DQN\uff09\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MARL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dDQN\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u4f5c\u4e1a\u673a\u5668\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5668\u6545\u969c\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u914d\u7f6e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7b49\u968f\u673a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u8fd8\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u534f\u5546\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u5173\u952e\u7684DQN\u589e\u5f3a\u5305\u62ec\u4f18\u5148\u4f53\u9a8c\u56de\u653e\u3001n\u6b65\u56de\u62a5\u3001\u53ccDQN\u548c\u8f6f\u76ee\u6807\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u52a0\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u7684RMS\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7f29\u77ed\u5236\u9020\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u673a\u5668\u5229\u7528\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u673a\u5668\u6545\u969c\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u914d\u7f6e\u65f6\u95f4\u7b49\u73b0\u5b9e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u589e\u5f3a\u7684DQN\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f46\u673a\u5668\u6545\u969c\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u5236\u9020\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u603b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u7684\u53ef\u53d8\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u5c06MARL\u673a\u5236\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u5236\u9020\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Detecting such leaks remains extremely challenging due to the weak acoustic emission and high ambient noise in the deep sea. This paper reviews the application of passive sonar systems combined with artificial intelligence (AI) in underwater oil and gas leak detection. The advantages and limitations of traditional monitoring methods, including fibre optic, capacitive and pH sensors, are compared with those of passive sonar systems. Advanced AI methods that enhance signal discrimination, noise suppression and data interpretation capabilities are explored for leak detection. Emerging solutions such as embedded AI analogue-to-digital converters (ADCs), deep learning-based denoising networks and semantically aware underwater optical communication (UOC) frameworks are also discussed to overcome issues such as low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and transmission instability. Furthermore, a hybrid approach combining non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF), convolutional neural networks (CNN) and temporal models (GRU, TCN) is proposed to improve the classification and quantification accuracy of leak events. Despite challenges such as data scarcity and environmental change, AI-assisted passive sonar has shown great potential in real-time, energy-efficient and non-invasive underwater monitoring, contributing to sustainable environmental protection and maritime safety management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528AI\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u88ab\u52a8\u58f0\u7eb3\u7cfb\u7edf\u68c0\u6d4b\u6c34\u4e0b\u6cb9\u6c14\u6cc4\u6f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u6c34\u4e0b\u6cb9\u6c14\u6cc4\u6f0f\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u78b3\u6c22\u5316\u5408\u7269\u3001\u76d0\u6c34\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u6c61\u67d3\u7269\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff0c\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u73af\u5883\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u68c0\u6d4b\u6b64\u7c7b\u6cc4\u6f0f\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6df1\u6d77\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u58f0\u53d1\u5c04\u4fe1\u53f7\u5fae\u5f31\u548c\u73af\u5883\u566a\u58f0\u9ad8\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5c24\u5176\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u5c06AI\u4e0e\u88ab\u52a8\u58f0\u7eb3\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u5728\u6c34\u4e0b\u6cb9\u6c14\u6cc4\u6f0f\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5149\u7ea4\u3001\u7535\u5bb9\u548cpH\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff09\u7684\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u6587\u4e2d\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fa8\u522b\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u6291\u5236\u548c\u6570\u636e\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5148\u8fdbAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0fAI\u6a21\u6570\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\uff08ADC\uff09\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u7f51\u7edc\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6c34\u4e0b\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\uff08UOC\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u7b49\u65b0\u5174\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\uff08SNR\uff09\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u975e\u8d1f\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\uff08NMF\uff09\u3001\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CNN\uff09\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff08GRU\u3001TCN\uff09\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6cc4\u6f0f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "AI\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u88ab\u52a8\u58f0\u7eb3\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u8282\u80fd\u548c\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u6c34\u4e0b\u76d1\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u73af\u5883\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u6d77\u4e0a\u5b89\u5168\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u88ab\u52a8\u58f0\u7eb3\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6c34\u4e0b\u6cb9\u6c14\u6cc4\u6f0f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6311\u6218\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5728\u73af\u5883\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u53d1\u6325\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

The framework operates in three stages: (1) transforming video content into fine-grained captions using a vision-language model, (2) constructing structured knowledge by organizing the captions into four semantic slots (action, object, context, environment), and (3) generating slot-wise explanations that reveal which semantic factors contribute most to the anomaly decision.

However, ensuring safe, fair, and reliable participation remains a persistent challenge. Traditional polling methods have seen a notable decline in engagement over recent decades, raising concerns about the credibility of collected data. Meanwhile, social and peer-to-peer networks have become increasingly widespread, but data from these platforms can suffer from credibility issues due to fraudulent or ineligible participation. In this paper, we explore how social interactions can help restore credibility in crowdsourced data collected over social networks. We present an empirical study to detect ineligible participation in a polling task through AI-based graph analysis of social interactions among imperfect participants composed of honest and dishonest actors. Our approach focuses solely on the structure of social interaction graphs, without relying on the content being shared. We simulate different levels and types of dishonest behavior among participants who attempt to propagate the task within their social networks. We conduct experiments on real-world social network datasets, using different eligibility criteria and modeling diverse participation patterns. Although structural differences in social interaction graphs introduce some performance variability, our study achieves promising results in detecting ineligibility across diverse social and behavioral profiles, with accuracy exceeding 90% in some configurations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u4f17\u5305\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u5408\u683c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc790%\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6c11\u610f\u8c03\u67e5\u53c2\u4e0e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f17\u5305\u6570\u636e\u9762\u4e34\u4fe1\u8a89\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u6b3a\u8bc8\u6216\u4e0d\u5408\u683c\u53c2\u4e0e\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528AI\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u7ed3\u6784\u800c\u975e\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u540c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6b3a\u8bc8\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0d\u5408\u683c\u53c2\u4e0e\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc790%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u793e\u4ea4\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u56fe\u8c31\u7ed3\u6784\u7684AI\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\u4f17\u5305\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4fe1\u8a89\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8bda\u5b9e\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u5408\u683c\u53c2\u4e0e\u3002"}}

The results show that early-stage metadata integration enhances both retrieval and answer accuracy while also revealing persistent challenges for RAG systems, including hallucinations during generation and difficulties in handling temporal or multi-hop historical queries.", "AI": {"tldr": "RAG\u5728\u53f0\u6e7e\u5386\u53f2\u6863\u6848\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u521d\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5143\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u68c0\u7d22\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u7b54\u6848\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5386\u53f2\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76RAG\u5728\u53f0\u6e7e\u5386\u53f2\u6863\u6848\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u67e5\u8be2\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5143\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5c06RAG\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u53f0\u6e7e\u5386\u53f2\u6863\u6848\uff08\u5982\u70ed\u5170\u906e\u57ce\u548c\u53f0\u6e7e\u7701\u8bae\u4f1a\u516c\u62a5\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u67e5\u8be2\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5143\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u65e9\u671f\u5143\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u5904\u7406\u5386\u53f2\u67e5\u8be2\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "RAG\u5728\u53f0\u6e7e\u5386\u53f2\u6863\u6848\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u6210\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u5386\u53f2\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

The intersection of all valid Bell inequalities is the so-called local polytope. In multipartite systems, characterizing the local polytope quickly becomes an intractable task as the system size increases. Optimizing Bell inequalities to maximize the ratio between their quantum value and classical bound is key to understanding multipartite nonlocality. We propose a gradient-based method for this optimization. Numerical results indicate that local maxima of this ratio typically correspond to facet Bell inequalities of the local polytope. This enables an iterative search for tight and robust Bell inequalities. Applied to permutation-invariant scenarios, the method provides tight Bell inequalities with large quantum violations and facilitates experimental certification of Bell correlations without full knowledge of the local polytope.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5bfb\u627e\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8d1d\u5c14\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u8be5\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u63ed\u793a\u91cf\u5b50\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u8d1d\u5c14\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u901a\u5e38\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u7684\u9762\u8d1d\u5c14\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u5bfb\u627e\u66f4\u7d27\u81f4\u3001\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8d1d\u5c14\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7f6e\u6362\u4e0d\u53d8\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u83b7\u5f97\u5177\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u5b50\u8fdd\u53cd\u7684\u8d1d\u5c14\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5728\u5bf9\u5c40\u90e8\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u4e86\u89e3\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u8d1d\u5c14\u5173\u8054\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8ba4\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8d1d\u5c14\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u8868\u5f81\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u68d8\u624b\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8d1d\u5c14\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5176\u91cf\u5b50\u503c\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u754c\u9650\u4e4b\u6bd4\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u4f53\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5bfb\u627e\u8d1d\u5c14\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5176\u91cf\u5b50\u503c\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u754c\u9650\u4e4b\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u6bd4\u7387\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u5927\u503c\u901a\u5e38\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u7684\u9762\u8d1d\u5c14\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u3002\u5c06\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7f6e\u6362\u4e0d\u53d8\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u5177\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u5b50\u8fdd\u53cd\u7684\u7d27\u81f4\u8d1d\u5c14\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5728\u5bf9\u5c40\u90e8\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u4e86\u89e3\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u8d1d\u5c14\u5173\u8054\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8ba4\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5bfb\u627e\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u8d1d\u5c14\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u8ba4\u8bc1\u591a\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

The emergence of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Claude, has expanded this integration even further. Because of LLM versatility and ease of use through APIs, these larger models are often utilised even though smaller, custom models can be used instead. In this paper, LLMs and small discriminative models are integrated into a Mendix application to detect Covid-19 in chest X-rays. These discriminative models are also used to provide knowledge bases for LLMs to improve accuracy. This provides a benchmark study of 14 different model configurations for comparison of accuracy and environmental impact. The findings indicated that while smaller models reduced the carbon footprint of the application, the output was biased towards a positive diagnosis and the output probabilities were lacking confidence. Meanwhile, restricting LLMs to only give probabilistic output caused poor performance in both accuracy and carbon footprint, demonstrating the risk of using LLMs as a universal AI solution. While using the smaller LLM GPT-4.1-Nano reduced the carbon footprint by 94.2% compared to the larger models, this was still disproportionate to the discriminative models; the most efficient solution was the Covid-Net model. Although it had a larger carbon footprint than other small models, its carbon footprint was 99.9% less than when using GPT-4.5-Preview, whilst achieving an accuracy of 95.5%, the highest of all models examined.

Experimental results show that both approaches provide significant improvements with reducing localization error between 69% (2-Tx) and 43% (4-Tx) compared to the K-means.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u591a\u4e2a\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u591a\u4e2a\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u5728\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u8868\u9762\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e25\u5cfb\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u8d28\u5fc3\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86AngleNN\u548cSizeNN\u4e24\u4e2a\u6b8b\u5dee\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7528\u4e8e\u65b9\u5411\u7ec6\u5316\u548c\u7c07\u5927\u5c0f\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0eK-means\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u57282\u4e2a\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8669%\uff0c\u57284\u4e2a\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8643%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u57fa\u7840\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

In our setting, the centralized allocator is interested in ensuring the allocation is fair among the groups and between agents. This setting applies to many real-world scenarios, including when a school administrator wants to allocate resources (e.g., office spaces and supplies) to staff members in departments and when a city council allocates limited housing units to various families in need across different communities. To ensure fair allocation between agents, we consider the classical envy-freeness (EF) notion. To ensure fairness among the groups, we define the notion of centralized group equitability (CGEQ) to capture the fairness for the groups from the allocator's perspective. Because an EF or CGEQ allocation does not always exist in general, we consider their corresponding natural relaxations of envy-freeness to one item (EF1) and centralized group equitability up to one item (CGEQ1). For different classes of valuation functions of the agents and the centralized allocator, we show that allocations satisfying both EF1 and CGEQ1 always exist and design efficient algorithms to compute these allocations. We also consider the centralized group maximin share (CGMMS) from the centralized allocator's perspective as a group-level fairness objective with EF1 for agents and present several results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u5206\u5272\u7269\u54c1\u5206\u914d\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u4e2a\u4f53\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u4f4f\u623f\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b66\u6821\u548c\u5e02\u653f\u90e8\u95e8\u9700\u8981\u516c\u5e73\u5730\u5c06\u6709\u9650\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e2a\u4f53\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\"\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6027\"\uff08CGEQ\uff09\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u5206\u914d\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\"\u65e0\u7fa1\u6155\"\uff08EF\uff09\u6982\u5ff5\u6765\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e2a\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002\u5f53\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u5168\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u5206\u914d\u65f6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u653e\u5bbd\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5373\"\u81f3\u591a\u4e00\u4ef6\u7269\u54c1\u7684\u65e0\u7fa1\u6155\"\uff08EF1\uff09\u548c\"\u81f3\u591a\u4e00\u4ef6\u7269\u54c1\u7684\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6027\"\uff08CGEQ1\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4f30\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u4e0b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3EF1\u548cCGEQ1\u7684\u5206\u914d\u603b\u662f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u4ee5\"\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7fa4\u4f53\u6700\u5927\u6700\u5c0f\u4efd\u989d\"\uff08CGMMS\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408EF1\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u4f30\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u4e0b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3EF1\u548cCGEQ1\u7684\u5206\u914d\u603b\u662f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e5f\u5bf9\u4ee5CGMMS\u4e3a\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408EF1\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u914d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u521d\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u5730\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u5206\u5272\u7269\u54c1\u5206\u914d\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e2a\u4f53\uff08EF1\uff09\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\uff08CGEQ1\uff09\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

The system is designed to translate battlefield complexity and the commander's intent into executable action plans. To this end, ARGUS employs a processing pipeline that takes as input geospatial terrain data, military intelligence on existing threats and their probable locations, and mission priorities defined by the commander. Through a set of integrated modules, the framework processes this information to generate optimized trajectories that balance mission objectives against the risks posed by threats and terrain characteristics. A fundamental capability of ARGUS is its dynamic nature, which allows it to adapt plans in real-time in response to unforeseen events, reflecting the fluid nature of the modern battlefield. The system's interoperability were validated in a practical exercise with the Portuguese Army, where it was successfully demonstrated that the routes generated by the model can be integrated and utilized by UGV control systems. The result is a decision support tool that not only produces an optimal trajectory but also provides the necessary insights for its execution, thereby contributing to greater effectiveness and safety in the employment of autonomous ground systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "ARGUS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3a\u6218\u672f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u65e0\u4eba\u5730\u9762\u8f66\u8f86\uff08UGV\uff09\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u5c06\u6218\u573a\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u6307\u6325\u5b98\u610f\u56fe\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u884c\u52a8\u8ba1\u5212\u3002\u5b83\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u60c5\u62a5\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\u3002ARGUS\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6f14\u4e60\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\u53ef\u4e0eUGV\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\uff0c\u5b83\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3b\u5730\u9762\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aARGUS\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u6218\u672f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4e3a\u65e0\u4eba\u5730\u9762\u8f66\u8f86\uff08UGV\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u6218\u573a\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u6307\u6325\u5b98\u610f\u56fe\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u884c\u52a8\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "ARGUS\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u5305\u62ec\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u5730\u5f62\u6570\u636e\u3001\u5173\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5a01\u80c1\u53ca\u5176\u53ef\u80fd\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u519b\u4e8b\u60c5\u62a5\u4ee5\u53ca\u6307\u6325\u5b98\u5b9a\u4e49ifi\u00e9s\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u5757\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u5a01\u80c1\u548c\u5730\u5f62\u7279\u5f81\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002ARGUS\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u5176\u52a8\u6001\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u8ba1\u5212\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u610f\u5916\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "ARGUS\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8461\u8404\u7259\u519b\u961f\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6f14\u4e60\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0eUGV\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u3002ARGUS\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u6700\u4f18\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6267\u884c\u8def\u7ebf\u6240\u9700\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "ARGUS\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u6218\u573a\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u7684UGV\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3b\u5730\u9762\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6218\u672f\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002\u5176\u6210\u529f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u6307\u6325\u5b98\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5e76\u9002\u5e94\u73b0\u4ee3\u6218\u573a\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u3002"}}

Here, we present a novel biologically-inspired computational framework to study these behaviors, where recurrent neural network (RNN) based artificial agents trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) learn to modulate their electric organ discharges (EODs) and movement patterns to collectively forage in virtual environments. Trained agents demonstrate several emergent features consistent with real fish collectives, including heavy tailed EOD interval distributions, environmental context dependent shifts in EOD interval distributions, and social interaction patterns like freeloading, where agents reduce their EOD rates while benefiting from neighboring agents' active sensing. A minimal two-fish assay further isolates the role of electro-communication, showing that access to conspecific EODs and relative dominance jointly shape foraging success. Notably, these behaviors emerge through evolution-inspired rewards for individual fitness and emergent inter-agent interactions, rather than through rewarding agents explicitly for social interactions.

When accelerating convolutional neural network (CNN) on DRAM-PIM, performance is often constrained by cross-bank (or cross-PIMcore) data transfers, which are induced by the conventional layer-by-layer dataflow that enforces inter-bank (or inter-PIMcore) dependencies across successive CNN layers. To address this challenge, we propose PIMfused, a hardware-software co-design that enables fused-layer dataflow for end-to-end CNN execution in near-bank DRAM-PIM. By adopting fused-layer dataflow, PIMfused improves data reuse and, more importantly, breaks inter-bank data dependencies, thereby optimizing cross-bank data transfers without sacrificing bank-level parallelism. We study the impact of buffer sizes and PIMcore parallelism (1-bank vs. 4-bank) on PIMfused using end-to-end ResNet18. We present three key takeaways and show that with 4-bank PIMcores, PIMfused achieves overall PPA gains over a GDDR6-AiM-like baseline, cutting memory cycles to 30.6%, energy to 83.4%, and area to 76.5%.", "AI": {"tldr": "PIMfused\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4f18\u5316\u8fd1\u94f6\u884cDRAM-PIM\u4e0a\u7684CNN\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8de8\u94f6\u884c\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728ResNet18\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86PPA\uff08\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u529f\u8017\u548c\u9762\u79ef\uff09\u7684\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd1\u94f6\u884c\u5185\u5b58\u5904\u7406\uff08PIM\uff09\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u52a0\u901f\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CNN\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u9010\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8de8\u94f6\u884c\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPIMfused\u7684\u8f6f\u786c\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684CNN\u6267\u884c\u7684\u878d\u5408\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u6d41\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u8de8\u94f6\u884c\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u94f6\u884c\u7ea7\u5e76\u884c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728ResNet18\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u5927\u5c0f\u548cPIM\u6838\u5fc3\u5e76\u884c\u6027\uff081\u94f6\u884c vs. 4\u94f6\u884c\uff09\u5bf9PIMfused\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u75284\u94f6\u884cPIM\u6838\u5fc3\u65f6\uff0cPIMfused\u76f8\u6bd4GDDR6-AiM\u57fa\u7ebf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6574\u4f53PPA\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u5468\u671f\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8630.6%\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8683.4%\uff0c\u9762\u79ef\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8676.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "PIMfused\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fd1\u94f6\u884cDRAM-PIM\u4e0a\u7684CNN\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u8de8\u94f6\u884c\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u529f\u8017\u548c\u9762\u79ef\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Current neural controllers for humanoids remain modest in size, target a limited behavior set, and are trained on a handful of GPUs over several days. We show that scaling up model capacity, data, and compute yields a generalist humanoid controller capable of creating natural and robust whole-body movements. Specifically, we posit motion tracking as a natural and scalable task for humanoid control, leverageing dense supervision from diverse motion-capture data to acquire human motion priors without manual reward engineering. We build a foundation model for motion tracking by scaling along three axes: network size (from 1.2M to 42M parameters), dataset volume (over 100M frames, 700 hours of high-quality motion data), and compute (9k GPU hours). Beyond demonstrating the benefits of scale, we show the practical utility of our model through two mechanisms: (1) a real-time universal kinematic planner that bridges motion tracking to downstream task execution, enabling natural and interactive control, and (2) a unified token space that supports various motion input interfaces, such as VR teleoperation devices, human videos, and vision-language-action (VLA) models, all using the same policy.

Deploying these massive models is a complex distributed systems challenge constrained by memory bandwidth, computational throughput, and latency requirements. LLM inference fundamentally requires solving a multi objective optimization problem to minimize latency, maximize throughput, and reduce cost. This paper explores the necessary architectural shift towards disaggregated inference, which applies distributed systems principles such as service decomposition, resource disaggregation, and workload partitioning to overcome the limitations of traditional monolithic GPU clusters.

Yet most robot learning algorithms remain blind to time. We introduce time-aware policy learning, a reinforcement learning framework that enables robots to explicitly perceive and reason with time as a first-class variable. The framework augments conventional reinforcement policies with two complementary temporal signals, the remaining time and a time ratio, which allow a single policy to modulate its behavior continuously from rapid and dynamic to cautious and precise execution. By jointly optimizing punctuality and stability, the robot learns to balance efficiency, robustness, resiliency, and punctuality without re-training or reward adjustment. Across diverse manipulation domains from long-horizon pick and place, to granular-media pouring, articulated-object handling, and multi-agent object delivery, the time-aware policy produces adaptive behaviors that outperform standard reinforcement learning baselines by up to 48% in efficiency, 8 times more robust in sim-to-real transfer, and 90% in acoustic quietness while maintaining near-perfect success rates. Explicit temporal reasoning further enables real-time human-in-the-loop control and multi-agent coordination, allowing robots to recover from disturbances, re-synchronize after delays, and align motion tempo with human intent. By treating time not as a constraint but as a controllable dimension of behavior, time-aware policy learning provides a unified foundation for efficient, robust, resilient, and human-aligned robot autonomy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5269\u4f59\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4\u7387\uff0c\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u6548\u7387\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u51c6\u65f6\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u6807\u51c6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u667a\u80fd\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u5269\u4f59\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4\u7387\u4e24\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u6b64\u6765\u8c03\u6574\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6267\u884c\u65b9\u5f0f\uff08\u4ece\u5feb\u901f\u52a8\u6001\u5230\u8c28\u614e\u7cbe\u786e\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u51c6\u65f6\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u8c03\u6574\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad848%\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u9ad88\u500d\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u58f0\u5b66\u9759\u8c27\u6027\u63d0\u9ad890%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8fd8\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u4eba\u673a\u73af\u8def\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5e72\u6270\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u3001\u5728\u5ef6\u8fdf\u540e\u91cd\u65b0\u540c\u6b65\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u610f\u56fe\u540c\u6b65\u8fd0\u52a8\u8282\u594f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u89c6\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u800c\u975e\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u6709\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u4e14\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, traditional credit assignment schemes in MARL cannot reliably capture individual contributions in strongly coupled tasks while maintaining training stability, which leads to limited generalization capabilities and hinders algorithm performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Historical Interaction-Enhanced Shapley Policy Gradient Algorithm (HIS) for Multi-Agent Credit Assignment, which employs a hybrid credit assignment mechanism to balance base rewards with individual contribution incentives. By utilizing historical interaction data to calculate the Shapley value in a sample-efficient manner, HIS enhances the agent's ability to perceive its own contribution, while retaining the global reward to maintain training stability. Additionally, we provide theoretical guarantees for the hybrid credit assignment mechanism, ensuring that the assignment results it generates are both efficient and stable. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in three widely used continuous-action benchmark environments: Multi-Agent Particle Environment, Multi-Agent MuJoCo, and Bi-DexHands.

A range of approaches have been explored, with graph-based models standing out for their ability to capture structural patterns in transaction networks. However, these approaches face two main challenges: label noise and label scarcity, leading to suboptimal performance and limited generalization. To address these, we propose HiLoMix, a graph-based learning framework specifically designed for mixing address association. First, we construct the Heterogeneous Attributed Mixing Interaction Graph (HAMIG) to enrich the topological structure. Second, we introduce frequency-aware graph contrastive learning that captures complementary structural signals from high- and low-frequency graph views. Third, we employ weak supervised learning that assigns confidence-based weighting to noisy labels.

Unlike standard scientific reasoning or general creative generation, idea generation in science is a multi-objective and open-ended task, where the novelty of a contribution is as essential as its empirical soundness. Large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as promising generators of scientific ideas, capable of producing coherent and factual outputs with surprising intuition and acceptable reasoning, yet their creative capacity remains inconsistent and poorly understood. This survey provides a structured synthesis of methods for LLM-driven scientific ideation, examining how different approaches balance creativity with scientific soundness. We categorize existing methods into five complementary families: External knowledge augmentation, Prompt-based distributional steering, Inference-time scaling, Multi-agent collaboration, and Parameter-level adaptation. To interpret their contributions, we employ two complementary frameworks: Boden's taxonomy of Combinatorial, Exploratory and Transformational creativity to characterize the level of ideas each family expected to generate, and Rhodes' 4Ps framework-Person, Process, Press, and Product-to locate the aspect or source of creativity that each method emphasizes.

In this work we show that, beyond qualitative detection, a family of well-defined measures of bipartite and multipartite entanglement can be obtained with symmetry tests. We propose and benchmark several efficient methods to estimate these measures, and derive near-optimal sampling strategies for each. Despite the nonlinearity of the methods, we demonstrate that the sampling error scales no worse than $O(N_{\\mathrm{tot}}^{-1/2})$ with the total number of copies $N_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, which suggests experimental feasibility. By exploiting symmetries we compute our measures for large number of copies, and derive the asymptotic decay exponents for relevant states in many-body systems.

The system leverages four specialized agents that work together to generate contextually appropriate educational content. Experimental validation on platforms including Raspberry Pi 4B and NVIDIA Jetson Nano demonstrates significant performance achievements. InkubaLM on Jetson Nano achieved a Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) of 129 ms, an average inter-token latency of 33 ms, and a throughput of 45.2 tokens per second while consuming 8.4 W. On Raspberry Pi 4B, InkubaLM also led with 326 ms TTFT and 15.9 tokens per second at 5.8 W power consumption. The framework consistently delivered high multilingual quality, averaging a BLEU score of 0.688, cultural relevance of 4.4/5, and fluency of 4.2/5 across tested African languages.

Our previous research has introduced a ``games-on-signed graphs'' framework~\\cite{LiMorse2022} to analyze these interactions. While the framework is intended to be basic and general, there is much left to be explored, particularly in capturing the complexity of strategic scenarios in international relations. Our paper aims to fill this gap in two key ways. First, we modify the existing preference axioms to allow for a more nuanced understanding of how countries pursue self-survival, defense of allies, and offense toward adversaries. Second, we introduce a novel algorithm that proves the existence of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium for these revised games. To validate our model, we employ historical data from the year 1940 as the game input and predict countries' survivability. Our contributions thus extend the real-world applicability of the original framework, offering a more comprehensive view of strategic interactions in a networked security environment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u201c\u5e26\u7b26\u53f7\u56fe\u535a\u5f08\u201d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u504f\u597d\u516c\u7406\u548c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u56fd\u5bb6\u95f4\u7684\u6218\u7565\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u75281940\u5e74\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u56fd\u9645\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u201c\u5e26\u7b26\u53f7\u56fe\u535a\u5f08\u201d\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6355\u6349\u56fd\u9645\u5173\u7cfb\u6218\u7565\u590d\u6742\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u504f\u597d\u516c\u7406\u548c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u5f25\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u56fd\u5bb6\u8ffd\u6c42\u751f\u5b58\u3001\u9632\u5fa1\u76df\u53cb\u548c\u5bf9\u654c\u65b9\u8fdb\u653b\u7684\u6218\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u4fee\u6539\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u504f\u597d\u516c\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u5141\u8bb8\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u56fd\u5bb6\u8ffd\u6c42\u751f\u5b58\u3001\u9632\u5fa1\u76df\u53cb\u548c\u5bf9\u654c\u65b9\u8fdb\u653b\u7684\u6218\u7565\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc1\u660e\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7684\u535a\u5f08\u5b58\u5728\u7eaf\u7b56\u7565\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u3002\u4f7f\u75281940\u5e74\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u535a\u5f08\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5229\u75281940\u5e74\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u535a\u5f08\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u751f\u5b58\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u504f\u597d\u516c\u7406\u548c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u201c\u5e26\u7b26\u53f7\u56fe\u535a\u5f08\u201d\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u56fd\u9645\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u7f51\u7edc\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6218\u7565\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u89c6\u56fe\u3002"}}

Krogstad", "Elif Ertekin"], "title": "Short-range order influences H distribution in Fe-Ni-Cr austenitic stainless steels", "comment": null, "summary": "Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) in austenitic stainless steels is advanced by hydrogen enhanced localized plasticity (HELP), typically accompanied by a transition from homogeneous to localized slip. Short-range order (SRO) in face-centered cubic (FCC) alloys is known to promote slip planarity, and recent studies suggest that H may amplify this localization behavior linked to inherent SRO. However, the manner in which the introduction of H affects SRO properties and, conversely, the manner that pre-existing SRO may affect H behavior, are not fully understood. In this work, a spin cluster expansion model combined with Monte Carlo simulation is employed to study the interplay between H and SRO in Fe-Ni-Cr alloys. Chemical order is quantified using Warren-Cowley SRO parameters, and the model predictions are validated against experimental data. We find that the presence of H only slightly alters the intrinsic ordering preference of the Fe-Ni-Cr alloys. As temperature decreases and the alloy evolves from disordered to ordered thermodynamic states, distinct H-metal correlations emerge. In particular, H-Ni and H-Cr pairs exhibit stronger ordering tendencies than H-Fe pairs, suggesting a selective affinity of H for certain atomic environments. On the other hand, we also find that compared to random alloys, when pre-existing SRO is present, it significantly affects the resulting H distribution by promoting local H enrichment in SRO domains. Such SRO-driven local H accumulation may facilitate slip localization and contribute to the early onset of embrittlement. These findings provide thermodynamic and structural insights into the interaction between H and SRO in austenitic stainless steels, highlighting possible implications on how the interaction between HELP and SRO brings about hydrogen embrittlement in austenitic stainless steels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6c22\u5728\u5965\u6c0f\u4f53\u4e0d\u9508\u94a2\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u6c22\u589e\u5f3a\u5c40\u90e8\u5851\u6027(HELP)\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6c22\u8106\uff0c\u8fd9\u901a\u5e38\u4f34\u968f\u7740\u4ece\u5747\u5300\u6ed1\u79fb\u5230\u5c40\u90e8\u6ed1\u79fb\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002FCC\u5408\u91d1\u4e2d\u7684\u77ed\u7a0b\u6709\u5e8f(SRO)\u5df2\u77e5\u4f1a\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6ed1\u79fb\u7684\u5e73\u9762\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6c22\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u4e0e\u56fa\u6709SRO\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8fd9\u79cd\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6c22\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cdSRO\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9884\u5148\u5b58\u5728\u7684SRO\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6c22\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u672a\u5b8c\u5168\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u65cb\u7c07\u5c55\u5f00\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Fe-Ni-Cr\u5408\u91d1\u4e2d\u6c22\u548cSRO\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u4f7f\u7528Warren-Cowley SRO\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5316\u5316\u5b66\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6c22\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u4ec5\u8f7b\u5fae\u6539\u53d8\u4e86Fe-Ni-Cr\u5408\u91d1\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u6392\u5e8f\u504f\u597d\u3002\u968f\u7740\u6e29\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u4ee5\u53ca\u5408\u91d1\u4ece\u65e0\u5e8f\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u72b6\u6001\u6f14\u53d8\u4e3a\u6709\u5e8f\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u6c22-\u91d1\u5c5e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\uff0c\u6c22-\u954d\u548c\u6c22-\u94ec\u5bf9\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6bd4\u6c22-\u94c1\u5bf9\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6c22\u5bf9\u67d0\u4e9b\u539f\u5b50\u73af\u5883\u5177\u6709\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u3002\u53e6\u4e00\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4e5f\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u5408\u91d1\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5f53\u5b58\u5728\u9884\u5148\u5b58\u5728\u7684SRO\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u4fc3\u8fdbSRO\u7574\u5185\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6c22\u5bcc\u96c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u6240\u5f97\u7684\u6c22\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u7531SRO\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6c22\u79ef\u7d2f\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6ed1\u79fb\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5bfc\u81f4\u6c22\u8106\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u53d1\u751f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u6c22\u548cSRO\u5728\u5965\u6c0f\u4f53\u4e0d\u9508\u94a2\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86HELP\u4e0eSRO\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4\u5965\u6c0f\u4f53\u4e0d\u9508\u94a2\u4e2d\u6c22\u8106\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9610\u660e\u6c22\uff08H\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u77ed\u7a0b\u6709\u5e8f\uff08SRO\uff09\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9884\u5148\u5b58\u5728\u7684SRO\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6c22\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u6c22\u8106\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u65cb\u7c07\u5c55\u5f00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76Fe-Ni-Cr\u5408\u91d1\u4e2dH\u548cSRO\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528Warren-Cowley SRO\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5316\u5316\u5b66\u987a\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6c22\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u4ec5\u8f7b\u5fae\u6539\u53d8Fe-Ni-Cr\u5408\u91d1\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u6392\u5e8f\u504f\u597d\u3002\u968f\u7740\u6e29\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u6c22-\u954d\u548c\u6c22-\u94ec\u5bf9\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6bd4\u6c22-\u94c1\u5bf9\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u503e\u5411\u3002\u9884\u5148\u5b58\u5728\u7684SRO\u901a\u8fc7\u4fc3\u8fdbSRO\u7574\u5185\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6c22\u5bcc\u96c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6c22\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6ed1\u79fb\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u548c\u6c22\u8106\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u53d1\u751f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6c22\u548cSRO\u5728\u5965\u6c0f\u4f53\u4e0d\u9508\u94a2\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u89c1\u89e3\u3002\u6c22-\u91d1\u5c5e\u5bf9\u5b58\u5728\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14SRO\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6c22\u79ef\u7d2f\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6c22\u8106\u3002"}}

We present parallel continuous-time and discrete-time designs in which each node runs a local adaptive observer and exchanges information over a directed graph. For both time scales, we establish stability of the network coupling operators, prove boundedness of all internal signals, and show convergence of each node estimate to the source despite model uncertainty and disturbances. We further derive input-to-state stability (ISS) bounds that quantify robustness to bounded process noise. A key distinction is that the discrete-time design uses constant adaptive gains and per-step regressor normalization to handle sampling effects, whereas the continuous-time design does not. A unified Lyapunov framework links local observer dynamics with graph topology. Simulations on star, cyclic, and path networks corroborate the analysis, demonstrating accurate tracking, robustness, and scalability with the number of sensing nodes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u90e8\u5206\u5df2\u77e5\u6e90\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5e76\u884c\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u8fd0\u884c\u4e00\u4e2a\u672c\u5730\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89c2\u5bdf\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u5411\u56fe\u4ea4\u6362\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u5df2\u77e5\u6e90\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6e90\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u884c\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u8fd0\u884c\u672c\u5730\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89c2\u5bdf\u5668\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u5411\u56fe\u4ea4\u6362\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6052\u5b9a\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u589e\u76ca\u548c\u6bcf\u6b65\u56de\u5f52\u91cf\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6765\u5904\u7406\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u5229\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684 Lyapunov \u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8\u89c2\u5bdf\u5668\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u8026\u5408\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u6240\u6709\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6709\u754c\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u4f30\u8ba1\u6536\u655b\u5230\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9\u6709\u754c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u8f93\u5165-\u72b6\u6001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff08ISS\uff09\u754c\u9650\u3002\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5177\u6709\u90e8\u5206\u5df2\u77e5\u6e90\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u662f\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u5904\u7406\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u5e94\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u533a\u522b\u3002"}}

Geints"], "title": "Angular Patterns of Photoluminescence in Quantum Dot Spherical Superparticles Mediated by Whispering-Gallery Modes", "comment": null, "summary": "Quantum dot superparticles are a specific class of metamaterials created through the self-assembly of nanometer semiconductor quantum dots into organized micro-scale structures, such as microspheres. Superparticles exhibit unique optical, chemical, and electronic properties. These properties are not merely the sum of the constituent quantum dots but rather bear the signature of the collective behavior of the nanoscale building blocks. In particular, assembling an ensemble of quantum dots into a super-sphere allows them to function as a single, high-quality optical resonator. This structure efficiently confines the emission from the pump-excited quantum dots via whispering gallery modes. The emissive properties of such a superparticle resonator remain an area of active investigation. Using numerical simulation, we study the angular structure of the photoluminescence from superparticles of various sizes and architectures formed from CdS quantum dots. We show that, in general, the angular distribution of the SP emission is characterized by strong asymmetry, with a maximum in the backward direction relative to the incident pump beam. In contrast, this asymmetry is virtually absent in the forward and side-scattering directions. The excitation of resonant modes in the superparticle enhances the emission intensity and reduces the degree of its backward asymmetry. Furthermore, coating the CdS quantum dot particle with a silicon dioxide layer increases the probability of exciting field resonances in such a core-shell superparticle.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u8d85\u7c92\u5b50\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5149\u5b66\u8c10\u632f\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c3a\u5bf8\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u5149\u81f4\u53d1\u5149\u89d2\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5177\u6709\u660e\u663e\u7684\u540e\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6fc0\u53d1\u5171\u632f\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u8868\u9762\u5305\u8986\u5c42\u5bf9\u53d1\u5c04\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u8d85\u7c92\u5b50\uff08\u7531\u81ea\u7ec4\u88c5\u7684\u7eb3\u7c73\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u8c10\u632f\u5668\uff09\u7684\u53d1\u5149\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5176\u5149\u81f4\u53d1\u5149\uff08PL\uff09\u7684\u89d2\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u5c3a\u5bf8\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u6fc0\u53d1\u5171\u632f\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u8868\u9762\u5305\u8986\u5c42\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5c3a\u5bf8\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7531CdS\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u8d85\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u5149\u81f4\u53d1\u5149\u89d2\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8d85\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u89d2\u5206\u5e03\u901a\u5e38\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u540e\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u524d\u5411\u548c\u4fa7\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u65b9\u5411\u5219\u51e0\u4e4e\u6ca1\u6709\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002\u6fc0\u53d1\u5171\u632f\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f1a\u589e\u5f3a\u53d1\u5c04\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u540e\u5411\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7528\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u7845\u5305\u8986CdS\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u8d85\u7c92\u5b50\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u6fc0\u53d1\u573a\u5171\u632f\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u8d85\u7c92\u5b50\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5149\u5b66\u8c10\u632f\u5668\uff0c\u5176\u5149\u81f4\u53d1\u5149\u89d2\u5206\u5e03\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u540e\u5411\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u8d85\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u6fc0\u53d1\u5171\u632f\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u5176\u8868\u9762\u5305\u8986\u6750\u6599\u6765\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u57fa\u5149\u5b66\u5668\u4ef6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

However, existing schemes such as rate coding, Poisson encoding, and time-to-first-spike (TTFS) often ignore spatial relationships and yield temporally inconsistent spike patterns. In this article, a novel cluster-based encoding approach is proposed, which leverages local density computation to preserve semantic structure in both spatial and temporal domains. This method introduces a 2D spatial cluster trigger that identifies foreground regions through connected component analysis and local density estimation. Then, extend to a 3D spatio-temporal (ST3D) framework that jointly considers temporal neighborhoods, producing spike trains with improved temporal consistency. Experiments on the N-MNIST dataset demonstrate that our ST3D encoder achieves 98.17% classification accuracy with a simple single-layer SNN, outperforming standard TTFS encoding (97.58%) and matching the performance of more complex deep architectures while using significantly fewer spikes (~3800 vs ~5000 per sample).

We first perform multi-level macro grouping and PPA-aware cell clustering to produce a unified connection matrix that captures both wirelength and dataflow among macros and clusters. Next, we use DREAMPlace to build a mixed-size placement prototype and obtain reference positions for each macro and cluster. Based on this prototype, we introduce ABPlace, an angle-based analytical method that optimizes macro positions on an ellipse to distribute macros uniformly near chip periphery, while optimizing wirelength and dataflow. A packing tree-based relocating procedure is then designed to jointly adjust the locations of macro groups and the macros within each group, by optimizing an expertise-inspired cost function that captures various design constraints through evolutionary search. Re$^{\\text{2}}$MaP repeats the above process: Only a subset of macro groups are positioned in each iteration, and the remaining macros are deferred to the next iteration to improve the prototype's accuracy. Using a well-established backend flow with sufficient timing optimizations, Re$^{\\text{2}}$MaP achieves up to 22.22% (average 10.26%) improvement in worst negative slack (WNS) and up to 97.91% (average 33.97%) improvement in total negative slack (TNS) compared to the state-of-the-art academic placer Hier-RTLMP. It also ranks higher on WNS, TNS, power, design rule check (DRC) violations, and runtime than the conference version ReMaP, across seven tested cases.

Quantum federated learning (QFL) overcomes these concerns by distributing model training among several quantum clients, consequently eliminating the requirement for centralized quantum storage and processing. However, in real-life quantum networks, clients frequently differ in terms of hardware capabilities, circuit designs, noise levels, and how classical data is encoded or preprocessed into quantum states. These differences create inherent heterogeneity across clients - not just in their data distributions, but also in their quantum processing behaviors. As a result, training a single global model becomes ineffective, especially when clients handle imbalanced or non-identically distributed (non-IID) data. To address this, we propose a new framework called personalized quantum federated learning (PQFL) for anomaly detection. PQFL enhances local model training at quantum clients using parameterized quantum circuits and classical optimizers, while introducing a quantum-centric personalization strategy that adapts each client's model to its own hardware characteristics and data representation. Extensive experiments show that PQFL significantly improves anomaly detection accuracy under diverse and realistic conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, PQFL reduces false errors by up to 23%, and achieves gains of 24.2% in AUROC and 20.5% in AUPR, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability in practical quantum federated settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08PQFL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u91cf\u5b50\u8054\u90a6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u533b\u7597\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u76d1\u6d4b\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5f02\u5e38\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u4e14\u5e26\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u3002\u91cf\u5b50\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08QFL\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4e4b\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u7535\u8def\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u4ee5\u53ca\u7ecf\u5178\u6570\u636e\u7f16\u7801\u6216\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08PQFL\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u589e\u5f3a\u91cf\u5b50\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u672c\u5730\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u5176\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u7279\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "PQFL\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cPQFL\u5c06\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8623%\uff0cAUROC\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8624.2%\uff0cAUPR\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8620.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "PQFL\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8054\u90a6\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u662f\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u51b3\u91cf\u5b50\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While bringing enhanced intelligence to mobile ends, their deployment suffers from a set of performance challenges, especially the generation quality degradation and prolonged latency. Prior works have mainly relied on solutions of cloud offloading or on-device Small Language Models (SLMs). However, the former is usually limited by the communication bottleneck, and the latter sacrifices generation quality due to resource constraints. To mitigate these limitations, this paper proposes Synera, a device-cloud synergistic LLM serving system that applies an efficient SLM-LLM synergistic mechanism. Through empirical studies on LLM's unique computing characteristics, Synera identifies a set of underexplored optimization opportunities in device-cloud synergistic LLM inference, including offloading decisions, pipeline stalls, and batching bottlenecks. To translate them into enhanced performance, Synera introduces tailored designs of communication-efficient selective offloading, stall-free parallel inference, and scalable cloud batching. Extensive evaluations with real-world testbeds show that Synera enables 1.20-5.47x better generation quality against competitive baselines with on-par latency performance.

Despite the wide adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, many AI-based time series analytical models suffer from task-specificity (i.e. one model for one task) and structural rigidity (i.e. the input-output format is fixed), leading to limited model performances and resource wastes. In this paper, we propose a Causal-Guided Multimodal Large Language Model (CM-LLM) that can solve heterogeneous power system time-series analysis tasks. First, we introduce a physics-statistics combined causal discovery mechanism to capture the causal relationship, which is represented by graph, among power system variables. Second, we propose a multimodal data preprocessing framework that can encode and fuse text, graph and time series to enhance the model performance. Last, we formulate a generic \"mask-and-reconstruct\" paradigm and design a dynamic input-output padding mechanism to enable CM-LLM adaptive to heterogeneous time-series analysis tasks with varying sample lengths. Simulation results based on open-source LLM Qwen and real-world dataset demonstrate that, after simple fine-tuning, the proposed CM-LLM can achieve satisfying accuracy and efficiency on three heterogeneous time-series analytics tasks: missing data imputation, forecasting and super resolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u5f02\u6784\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5f15\u5bfc\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08CM-LLM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u7f3a\u5931\u6570\u636e\u586b\u5145\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u521a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u4e14\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406-\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u673a\u5236\u6765\u6355\u6349\u53d8\u91cf\u95f4\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff08\u4ee5\u56fe\u8868\u793a\uff09\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u878d\u5408\u6587\u672c\u3001\u56fe\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u201c\u63a9\u7801-\u91cd\u6784\u201d\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u586b\u5145\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7fCM-LLM\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f00\u6e90LLM Qwen\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCM-LLM\u5728\u7f3a\u5931\u6570\u636e\u586b\u5145\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e09\u4e2a\u5f02\u6784\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u6ee1\u610f\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "CM-LLM\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002"}}

We demonstrate the utility of the recently released HoloOcean 2.0 simulator with improved dynamics for torpedo AUV vehicles and a new ROS 2 interface.

With this HIL and SIL setup, simulations are run in HoloOcean using a ROS 2 bridge such that simulated sensor data is sent to the CougUV (mimicking sensor drivers) and control surface commands are sent back to the simulation, where vehicle dynamics and sensor data are calculated.

A Controlled Study of Multi-Agent Debate in Logical Reasoning", "comment": "20 pages, 6 figures", "summary": "Multi-agent debate (MAD) has recently emerged as a promising framework for improving the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs). Yet, whether LLM agents can genuinely engage in deliberative reasoning, beyond simple ensembling or majority voting, remains unclear. We address this question through a controlled study using the Knight--Knave--Spy logic puzzle, which enables precise, step-wise evaluation of debate outcomes and processes under verifiable ground truth. We systematically set up six structural and cognitive factors, including agent team size, composition, confidence visibility, debate order, debate depth, and task difficulty, to disentangle their respective effects on collective reasoning. Our results show that intrinsic reasoning strength and group diversity are the dominant drivers of debate success, while structural parameters such as order or confidence visibility offer limited gains. Beyond outcomes, process-level analyses identify key behavioral patterns: majority pressure suppresses independent correction, effective teams overturn incorrect consensus, and rational, validity-aligned reasoning most strongly predicts improvement. These findings provide valuable insights into how and why LLM debates succeed or fail, offering guidance for designing interpretable and truth-seeking multi-agent reasoning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\uff08MAD\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u662f\u5426\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u6216\u6295\u7968\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u5ba1\u8bae\u63a8\u7406\u4ecd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u201c\u9a91\u58eb-\u6076\u68cd-\u95f4\u8c0d\u201d\u903b\u8f91\u8c1c\u9898\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fa9\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u56e2\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u6784\u6210\u3001\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u3001\u8fa9\u8bba\u987a\u5e8f\u3001\u8fa9\u8bba\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u7b49\u516d\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5185\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u591a\u6837\u6027\u662f\u8fa9\u8bba\u6210\u529f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u800c\u987a\u5e8f\u6216\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u7b49\u7ed3\u6784\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u6709\u9650\u3002\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u591a\u6570\u6d3e\u538b\u529b\u4f1a\u6291\u5236\u72ec\u7acb\u7ea0\u9519\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u56e2\u961f\u80fd\u591f\u63a8\u7ffb\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\uff0c\u800c\u7406\u6027\u3001\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6700\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u5bfb\u6c42\u771f\u76f8\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\uff08MAD\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u5ba1\u8bae\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u6216\u6295\u7968\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u201c\u9a91\u58eb-\u6076\u68cd-\u95f4\u8c0d\u201d\u903b\u8f91\u8c1c\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u9879\u53d7\u63a7\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u516d\u4e2a\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u56e2\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u6784\u6210\u3001\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u3001\u8fa9\u8bba\u987a\u5e8f\u3001\u8fa9\u8bba\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b83\u4eec\u5bf9\u96c6\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5185\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u591a\u6837\u6027\u662f\u8fa9\u8bba\u6210\u529f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u7ed3\u6784\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5982\u987a\u5e8f\u6216\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\uff09\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u6709\u9650\u3002\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u6d3e\u538b\u529b\u4f1a\u6291\u5236\u72ec\u7acb\u7ea0\u9519\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u56e2\u961f\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a8\u7ffb\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\uff0c\u800c\u7406\u6027\u3001\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6700\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u7684\u8fa9\u8bba\u6210\u529f\u4e3b\u8981\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5185\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8c03\u6574\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fa9\u8bba\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

A strategy to realize such sources relies on the cooperative coupling of quantum emitters, enabling collective light emission known as superradiance. Here, we demonstrate that organic molecular J-aggregates exhibit room temperature superradiant emission that transitions to a highly collective regime of ~250 synchronized J-excitons when strongly coupled to delocalized photonic modes of a silicon bound-state-in-the-continuum metasurface. This enhanced cooperativity manifests as a Rabi splitting dependent scaling of both emission rate and intensity, driving the system into a superbunching regime of photon statistics. At the highest excitation density, we observe massively superbunched photon emission with g2(0)>13, unlocking new possibilities for engineering ultrafast, temporally correlated light sources that can operate at room temperature.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6709\u673a\u5206\u5b50J-\u805a\u96c6\u4f53\u4e0e\u7845\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u5ba4\u6e29\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8367\u5149\u53d1\u5c04\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u540c\u6b65\u7684J-\u6fc0\u5b50\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8d85\u805a\u5149\u5149\u5b50\u53d1\u5c04\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u8d85\u5feb\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u8054\u7684\u5149\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5173\u8054\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5149\u5b66\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u6280\u672f\u4ee5\u53ca\u5149\u4e0e\u7269\u8d28\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u7814\u7a76\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6709\u673a\u5206\u5b50J-\u805a\u96c6\u4f53\u4e0e\u7845\u675f\u7f1a\u6001-\u5728-\u8fde\u7eed\u533a\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5ba4\u6e29\u4e0b\u7684\u8d85\u8367\u5149\u53d1\u5c04\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5149\u5b50\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5ba4\u6e29\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u673a\u5206\u5b50J-\u805a\u96c6\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8d85\u8367\u5149\u53d1\u5c04\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u5165\u7ea6250\u4e2a\u540c\u6b65J-\u6fc0\u5b50\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u8026\u5408\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u53d1\u5c04\u7387\u548c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u968fRabi\u5288\u88c2\u5448\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u6807\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u5165\u8d85\u805a\u5149\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u9ad8\u6fc0\u53d1\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0bg2(0)>13\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6709\u673a\u5206\u5b50J-\u805a\u96c6\u4f53\u4e0e\u7845\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u7684\u8026\u5408\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5ba4\u6e29\u4e0b\u7684\u8d85\u8367\u5149\u53d1\u5c04\u548c\u8d85\u805a\u5149\u5149\u5b50\u53d1\u5c04\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5316\u8d85\u5feb\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u8054\u7684\u5149\u6e90\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

Modulo cameras address this by folding incident irradiance into a bounded range, yet require specialized unwrapping algorithms to reconstruct the underlying signal. Unlike HDR recovery, which extends dynamic range from conventional sampling, modulo recovery restores actual values from folded samples. Despite being introduced over a decade ago, progress in modulo image recovery has been slow, especially in the use of modern deep learning techniques. In this work, we demonstrate that standard HDR methods are unsuitable for modulo recovery. Transformers, however, can capture global dependencies and spatial-temporal relationships crucial for resolving folded video frames. Still, adapting existing Transformer architectures for modulo recovery demands novel techniques. To this end, we present Selective Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer (SSViT), the first deep learning framework for modulo video reconstruction. SSViT employs a token selection strategy to improve efficiency and concentrate on the most critical regions.

While the rise of large-language models offer new possible opportunities for measuring expressions of human values (e.g., humility or equality) in social media data, there remain both conceptual and practical challenges in operationalizing value expression in social media posts: what value system and operationalization is most applicable, and how do we actually measure them? In this paper, we draw on the Schwartz value system as a broadly encompassing and theoretically grounded set of basic human values, and introduce a framework for measuring Schwartz value expressions in social media posts at scale. We collect 32,370 ground truth value expression annotations from N=1,079 people on 5,211 social media posts representative of real users' feeds. We observe low levels of inter-rater agreement between people, and low agreement between human raters and LLM-based methods. Drawing on theories of interpretivism - that different people will have different subjective experiences of the same situation - we argue that value expression is (partially) in the eye of the beholder. In response, we construct a personalization architecture for classifying value expressions. We find that a system that explicitly models these differences yields predicted value expressions that people agree with more than they agree with other people. These results contribute new methods and understanding for the measurement of human values in social media data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6d4b\u91cf\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u8868\u8fbe\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f46\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u6d4b\u91cf\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u8868\u8fbe\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u8868\u8fbe\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6311\u6218\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u8be5\u4f53\u7cfb\u662f\u4e00\u5957\u5e7f\u6cdb\u800c\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u6536\u96c6\u4e86\u6765\u81ea1079\u4eba\u768432370\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u503c\u8868\u8fbe\u6ce8\u91ca\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6ce8\u91ca\u6765\u81ea5211\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5e16\u5b50\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5e16\u5b50\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u8868\u8fbe\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u66f4\u53d7\u7528\u6237\u8ba4\u53ef\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u503c\u8868\u8fbe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6d4b\u91cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u8868\u8fbe\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u662f\u201c\u89c1\u4ec1\u89c1\u667a\u201d\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u53ef\u80fd\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

However, adapting LLMs to effectively handle structural data, such as knowledge graphs or web data, remains a challenging problem. Some approaches adopt complex strategies to convert graphs into text sequences, resulting in significant token overhead and rendering them impractical for large-scale graphs. Others introduce additional modules to encode graphs into fixed-size token representations for LLMs. However, these methods typically require large-scale post-training on graph-text corpus and complex alignment procedures, yet often yield sub-optimal results due to poor modality alignment. Inspired by in-parameter knowledge injection for test-time adaptation of LLMs, we propose GRIP, a novel framework that equips LLMs with the ability to internalize complex relational information from graphs through carefully designed fine-tuning tasks. This knowledge is efficiently stored within lightweight LoRA parameters, enabling the fine-tuned LLM to perform a wide range of graph-related tasks without requiring access to the original graph at inference time. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "GRIP\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f7fLLM\u80fd\u591f\u5185\u5316\u56fe\u8c31\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b58\u50a8\u5728LoRA\u53c2\u6570\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65e0\u9700\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u8c31\u5373\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u56fe\u8c31\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06LLM\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff09\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8f6c\u6362\u590d\u6742\u3001\u6807\u8bb0\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u6c42\u5927\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGRIP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f7fLLM\u80fd\u591f\u5185\u5316\u56fe\u8c31\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u77e5\u8bc6\u9ad8\u6548\u5b58\u50a8\u5728\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LoRA\u53c2\u6570\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "GRIP\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4f7fLLM\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u8c31\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65e0\u9700\u56fe\u8c31\u5373\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u8c31\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

We derive the ground state wave function and the associated energy spectrum analytically, using the asymmetry (width parameter) $\u03b1$ as the primary control parameter. These results show a systematic and evident influence on $\u03b1$. We assess the non-Gaussianity and non-classicality measures, quantifying their nonlinearity and quantum behavior. In particular, we discover that both metrics rise monotonically with $\u03b1$. Furthermore, we examine the metrological performance for estimating $\u03b1$. By calculating the pertinent Fisher information and building workable estimators, we show that optimal strategies can saturate the Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound, with straightforward position measurements on shallow wells already producing high precision. These results collectively demonstrate that the double-Morse potential is a genuine, controllable source of non-Gaussianity, whose non-classicality and metrological applications increase with $\u03b1$.

However, numerous technical reports indicate that purely rule-based reward RL frequently results in poor-quality reasoning chains or inconsistencies between reasoning processes and final answers, particularly when the base model is of smaller scale. During the RL exploration process, models might employ low-quality reasoning chains due to the lack of knowledge, occasionally producing correct answers randomly and receiving rewards based on established rule-based judges. This constrains the potential for resource-limited organizations to conduct direct reinforcement learning training on smaller-scale models. We propose a novel confidence-based reward model tailored for enhancing STEM reasoning capabilities. Unlike conventional approaches, our model penalizes not only incorrect answers but also low-confidence correct responses, thereby promoting more robust and logically consistent reasoning. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through static evaluations, Best-of-N inference tests, and PPO-based RL training. Our method outperforms several state-of-the-art open-source reward models across diverse STEM benchmarks.

However, in many scenarios, division of resources has a direct impact on the whole group or even society. Therefore, we study fair allocations of indivisible items that, at the same time, maximize social impact. In this model, each agent is associated with two additive functions that define their value and social impact for each item. The goal is to allocate items so that the social impact is maximized while maintaining some fairness criterion. We reveal that the complexity of the problem heavily depends on whether the agents are socially aware, i.e., they take into consideration the social impact functions. For socially unaware agents, we prove that the problem is NP-hard for a variety of fairness notions, and that it is tractable only for very restricted cases, e.g., if, for every agent, the valuation equals social impact and it is binary. On the other hand, social awareness allows for fair allocations that maximize social impact, and such allocations can be computed in polynomial time. Interestingly, the problem becomes again intractable as soon as the definition of social awareness is relaxed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6700\u5927\u5316\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u610f\u8bc6\u5bf9\u95ee\u9898\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u6240\u6709\u4ee3\u7406\u90fd\u662f\u81ea\u79c1\u7684\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u5206\u914d\u4f1a\u5bf9\u6574\u4e2a\u7fa4\u4f53\u751a\u81f3\u793e\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8981\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u5e73\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u8fd8\u8981\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5206\u914d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u5173\u8054\u4e24\u4e2a\u52a0\u6027\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u8be5\u4ee3\u7406\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7269\u54c1\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u8be5\u7269\u54c1\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5728\u6700\u5927\u5316\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5f53\u4ee3\u7406\u662f\u793e\u4f1a\u610f\u8bc6\uff08\u5373\u8003\u8651\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\uff09\u548c\u975e\u793e\u4f1a\u610f\u8bc6\uff08\u5373\u4e0d\u8003\u8651\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5f88\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u662f\u5426\u5177\u6709\u793e\u4f1a\u610f\u8bc6\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u793e\u4f1a\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u975e\u5e38\u5bbd\u677e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u95ee\u9898\u4e5f\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u662fNP-hard\u7684\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u5728\u6781\u5c11\u6570\u53d7\u9650\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u4f30\u503c\u7b49\u4e8e\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u4e14\u4e3a\u4e8c\u5143\u503c\uff09\u624d\u662f\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u793e\u4f1a\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fa\u65e2\u516c\u5e73\u53c8\u80fd\u6700\u5927\u5316\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u4f46\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u4e00\u65e6\u653e\u5bbd\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u95ee\u9898\u5c06\u518d\u6b21\u53d8\u5f97\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u610f\u8bc6\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u5206\u914d\u548c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u793e\u4f1a\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u5e73\u4e0e\u6700\u5927\u5316\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u793e\u4f1a\u610f\u8bc6\u6216\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5bbd\u677e\u5219\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Each player selects actions from a finite set and evolves through a finite set of states. State transitions occur stochastically and depend on the player's chosen action. A player's single-stage reward depends on their state, action, and the population-wide distribution of states and actions, capturing aggregate effects such as congestion in traffic networks. Each player seeks to maximize a discounted infinite-horizon reward. Existing evolutionary game-theoretic approaches introduce a model for the way individual players update their decisions in static environments without individual state dynamics. In contrast, this work develops an evolutionary framework for dynamic games with explicit state evolution, which is necessary to model many applications. We introduce a mean field approximation of the finite-population game and establish approximation guarantees. Since state-of-the-art solution concepts for dynamic games lack an evolutionary interpretation, we propose a new concept - the Mixed Stationary Nash Equilibrium (MSNE) - which admits one.

Bulk crystals of this 3D topological insulator exhibit a transition from bulk to surface-dominated conductivity below 100 K, whereas in thin flakes, bulk conductivity is suppressed at even higher temperatures. Our data therefore suggest that a key ingredient for elevated mobility is the absence of bulk carriers at the Fermi level. A fingerprint of the high-mobility carriers, i.e a steep low-field magnetoresistance along with a strong Hall effect nonlinearity below 1 T, signifies the presence of at least two surface-related carrier species, even when bulk states are frozen out. To explain the magnetoresistance and the Hall effect in a wider range of magnetic fields ($>1$ T), one must assume that the carrier mobility drops with the field. The influence of Zeeman splitting on mobility and the contribution of anomalous Hall conductivity provide a much better description of the magnetoresistance and the nonlinearity of the Hall coefficient. Our data call for a revision of the surface state mobility in 3D topological insulators.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

An any-order autoregressive model accesses a target distribution $\u03bc$ on $[q]^n$ through an oracle that provides conditional marginals, while a denoising diffusion model accesses a target distribution $\u03bc$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ through an oracle that provides conditional means under Gaussian noise. Standard sequential sampling algorithms require $\\widetilde{O}(n)$ time to produce a sample from $\u03bc$ in either setting. We show that, by issuing oracle calls in parallel, the expected sampling time can be reduced to $\\widetilde{O}(n^{1/2})$. This improves the previous $\\widetilde{O}(n^{2/3})$ bound for any-order autoregressive models and yields the first parallel speedup for diffusion models in the high-accuracy regime, under the relatively mild assumption that the support of $\u03bc$ is bounded.\n  We introduce a novel technique to obtain our results: speculative rejection sampling. This technique leverages an auxiliary ``speculative'' distribution~$\u03bd$ that approximates~$\u03bc$ to accelerate sampling. Our technique is inspired by the well-studied ``speculative decoding'' techniques popular in large language models, but differs in key ways. Firstly, we use ``autospeculation,'' namely we build the speculation $\u03bd$ out of the same oracle that defines~$\u03bc$. In contrast, speculative decoding typically requires a separate, faster, but potentially less accurate ``draft'' model $\u03bd$. Secondly, the key differentiating factor in our technique is that we make and accept speculations at a ``sequence'' level rather than at the level of single (or a few) steps.

Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks show that BDD2Seq achieves around 1.4 times lower Quantum Cost and 3.7 times faster synthesis than modern heuristic algorithms.

However, we often want policies (1) to be robust, i.e., they perform well on perturbations of the MDP and (2) to satisfy additional structural constraints regarding, e.g., their representation or implementation cost. Computing such robust and constrained policies is indeed computationally more challenging. This paper contributes the first approach to effectively compute robust policies subject to arbitrary structural constraints using a flexible and efficient framework. We achieve flexibility by allowing to express our constraints in a first-order theory over a set of MDPs, while the root for our efficiency lies in the tight integration of satisfiability solvers to handle the combinatorial nature of the problem and probabilistic model checking algorithms to handle the analysis of MDPs. Experiments on a few hundred benchmarks demonstrate the feasibility for constrained and robust policy synthesis and the competitiveness with state-of-the-art methods for various fragments of the problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u548c\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5728\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u6ee1\u8db3\u989d\u5916\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u7ea6\u675f\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u5173\u4e8e\u4e00\u7ec4MDP\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u548c\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u5904\u7406\u7ec4\u5408\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548cMDP\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7b56\u7565\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u95ee\u9898\u7247\u6bb5\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4e00\u9636\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u548c\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002"}}

To better understand and mitigate these risks, we present one of the first provider-internal, practice-based analysis of LLM inference incidents. We developed a taxonomy and methodology grounded in a year of operational experience, validating it on 156 high-severity incidents, and conducted a focused quantitative study of Apr-Jun 2025 to ensure recency and relevance. Our approach achieves high labeling consistency (Cohen's K ~0.89), identifies dominant failure modes (in our dataset ~60% inference engine failures, within that category ~40% timeouts), and surfaces mitigation levers (~74% auto-detected; ~28% required hotfix). Beyond hotfixes, many incidents were mitigated via traffic routing, node rebalancing, or capacity increase policies, indicating further automation opportunities. We also show how the taxonomy guided targeted strategies such as connection liveness, GPU capacity-aware routing, and per-endpoint isolation and reduced incident impact and accelerated recovery. Finally, we contribute a practitioner-oriented adoption checklist that enables others to replicate our taxonomy, analysis, and automation opportunities in their own systems.

Also, the significant data collection needed for training makes real-world deployment difficult. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose an ML-based, decoder-only solution for compressed CSI. Our approach uses a standardized encoder for CSI compression on the user side and a site-specific generative decoder at the base station to refine the compressed CSI using environmental knowledge. We introduce two training schemes for the generative decoder: An end-to-end method and a two-stage method, both utilizing a goal-oriented loss function. Furthermore, we reduce the data collection overhead by using a site-specific digital twin to generate synthetic CSI data for training. Our simulations highlight the effectiveness of this solution across various feedback overhead regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Massive MIMO\u4e2d\u7684CSI\u83b7\u53d6\u9762\u4e34\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eML\u7684\u3001\u4ec5\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u538b\u7f29CSI\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u7ad9\u70b9\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfML\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3001\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "Massive MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u7684CSI\uff0c\u4f46\u5929\u7ebf\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u5bfc\u81f4\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u5347\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684ML\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3001\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eML\u7684\u3001\u4ec5\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u538b\u7f29CSI\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884cCSI\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u7ad9\u70b9\u7684\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5229\u7528\u73af\u5883\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fdb\u884cCSI\u7ec6\u5316\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u548c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u9762\u5411\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u5229\u7528\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210CSI\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u53cd\u9988\u5f00\u9500\u4e0b\u90fd\u5177\u6709\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eML\u7684\u3001\u4ec5\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u538b\u7f29CSI\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7f3a\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Massive MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684CSI\u83b7\u53d6\u3002"}}

Existing methods typically build networks on top of 2D visual backbones and depend heavily on labeled data for training, which is often scarce in real-world scenarios, causing a sim-to-real gap. Moreover, these approaches reduce the 3D-based problem to 2D domain, neglecting the 3D priors. To address these, we propose Robot Topological Alignment Graph (RoboTAG), which incorporates a 3D branch to inject 3D priors while enabling co-evolution of the 2D and 3D representations, alleviating the reliance on labels. Specifically, the RoboTAG consists of a 3D branch and a 2D branch, where nodes represent the states of the camera and robot system, and edges capture the dependencies between these variables or denote alignments between them. Closed loops are then defined in the graph, on which a consistency supervision across branches can be applied. This design allows us to utilize in-the-wild images as training data without annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is effective across robot types, highlighting its potential to alleviate the data bottleneck in robotics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRoboTAG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u75282D\u548c3D\u5206\u652f\u8fdb\u884c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5b58\u5728sim-to-real\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u4e14\u5c063D\u95ee\u9898\u964d\u7ef4\u81f32D\u3002", "method": "RoboTAG\u5305\u542b2D\u548c3D\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u8282\u70b9\u4ee3\u8868\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u8fb9\u4ee3\u8868\u4f9d\u8d56\u6216\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u95ed\u73af\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u5206\u652f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u53ef\u4f7f\u7528\u91ce\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "conclusion": "RoboTAG\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u54082D\u548c3D\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

We developed an experimental setup to detect the second harmonic (SH) signal under isothermal conditions. This SH-US signal was observed only in samples containing MNPs and consequently originated from the EMF interaction on samples containing MNPs. These findings suggest that US generation due to magneto-acoustic interaction in the MNPs could be responsible for the cell damage induced by EMF in cells containing MNPs without increasing the temperature. Experiments performed on magnetically aligned MNP clusters in gelatin significantly enhance the amplitude of the SH signal compared to non-aligned samples.

Recent works have attributed this to the phenomenon of mode interpolation and score smoothening, but they lack a method to prevent their generation during sampling. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc adjustment to the score function during inference that leverages the Laplacian (or sharpness) of the score to reduce mode interpolation hallucination in unconditional diffusion models across 1D, 2D, and high-dimensional image data. We derive an efficient Laplacian approximation for higher dimensions using a finite-difference variant of the Hutchinson trace estimator. We show that this correction significantly reduces the rate of hallucinated samples across toy 1D/2D distributions and a high- dimensional image dataset. Furthermore, our analysis explores the relationship between the Laplacian and uncertainty in the score.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6e90\u4e8e\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d2\u503c\u548c\u5206\u6570\u5e73\u6ed1\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5206\u6570\u7684\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u5ea6\uff08\u9510\u5ea6\uff09\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5e76\u57281D\u30012D\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u5f3a\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u8fde\u8d2f\u6216\u4e0d\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff08\u5e7b\u89c9\uff09\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u5176\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d2\u503c\u548c\u5206\u6570\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u540e\u9a8c\u8c03\u6574\u5206\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5206\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u5ea6\uff08\u9510\u5ea6\uff09\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d2\u503c\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206 Hutchinson \u8ff9\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u73a9\u51771D/2D\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5728\u73a9\u51771D/2D\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5e7b\u89c9\u6837\u672c\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5206\u6570\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

We formalize, implement, and evaluate an agentic LLM workflow that leverages procedural knowledge in the form of a hierarchical task network (HTN). Empirical results of our implementation show that hand-coded HTNs can dramatically improve LLM performance on agentic tasks, and using HTNs can boost a 20b or 70b parameter LLM to outperform a much larger 120b parameter LLM baseline. Furthermore, LLM-created HTNs improve overall performance, though less so.

The DFT$+U$$+V$ formalism extends DFT, supplemented by the onsite Coulomb interaction $U$, to address local correlation effects in localized states by incorporating intersite Coulomb interaction terms $V$. It holds promise for improving charge and bond disproportionation, charge and orbital ordering, charge density wave formation, charge transfer, and the intersite correlation resulting from hybridization between states of neighboring sites in a solid. $U$ and $V$ parameters are obtained from first principles using the constrained random-phase approximation (cRPA) employing two different atom basis representations to project the screened Coulomb interaction: the Wannier and the muffin-tin basis functions. We investigate in detail the impact of the $V$ term for typical covalently bonded materials like graphene, for bulk semiconductors such as silicon and germanium, and for charge-transfer insulators like NiO. Our results demonstrate an improvement in accuracy of specific properties across these systems, providing a framework for describing materials with different interaction regimes.

But the increasing complexity of SEVs prompted by greater dependence on interconnected systems, autonomous capabilities and electrification, presents new challenges in cybersecurity as well as functional safety. The safety and reliability of such vehicles is paramount, as unsafe or unreliable operation in either case represents an unacceptable risk in terms of the performance of the vehicle and safety of the passenger. This paper investigates the integrated development of cybersecurity and functional safety for SEVs, emphasizing the requirement for the parallel development of these domains as components that are not treated separately. In SEVs, cybersecurity is quite crucial in order to prevent the threats of hacking, data breaches and unauthorized access to vehicle systems. Functional safety ensures that important vehicle functions (braking, steering, battery control, etc.) keep working even if some part fails. This convergence of functional safety issues with cybersecurity issues is becoming more crucial, since a security incident can result in a failure of catastrophic consequences for a functional safety system and, conversely. This paper reports the current state of cybersecurity and functional safety standards for SEVs, highlighting challenges that include the weaknesses of communication networks, the potential security threats of over-the-air updates, and the demand for real-time responsive systems for failure.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

While previous studies have shown that higher-order hopping or constrained quasiperiodic potentials can induce a mixed-phase zone in one dimension, we demonstrate that the dissipation can induce mixed phase zone in a one dimensional nearest-neighbor system without imposing any explicit constraints on the quasiperiodic potential or hopping param- eter. Our approach exploits an exact correspondence between the eigenspectrum of the Liouvillian superoperator and that of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, valid for quadratic fermionic systems un- der linear dissipation. Using third quantization approach within Majorana fermionic representation, we analyze two dissipation configurations: alternating gain and loss at every site, and at alternate sites under balanced and imbalanced conditions. By computing the inverse and normalized partici- pation ratios, we show that dissipation can drive the system into three distinct phases: delocalizd, mixed, and localized. Notably, the mixed-phase zone is absent for balanced dissipation at every site but emerges upon introducing imbalance, while for alternate site dissipation it appears in both balanced and imbalanced cases. Furthermore, the critical points and the width of the mixed-phase window can be selectively tuned by varying the dissipation strength. These findings reveal that the dissipation plays a decisive role in reshaping localization transitions in quasiperiodic systems, offering new insight into the interplay between non-Hermitian effects and quasiperiodic order.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u65e0\u8017\u6563\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u68af\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u9ad8\u9636\u8df3\u8dc3\u6216\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u52bf\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4e00\u7ef4\u6df7\u5408\u76f8\u533a\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8017\u6563\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4e00\u7ef4\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u76f8\u533a\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u5bf9\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u52bf\u6216\u8df3\u8dc3\u53c2\u6570\u65bd\u52a0\u4efb\u4f55\u663e\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u9006\u53c2\u4e0e\u6bd4\u548c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u53c2\u4e0e\u6bd4\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8017\u6563\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a71\u52a8\u5230\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff1a\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u548c\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u3002\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u7cfb\u7edf\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u8df3\u8dc3\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u8017\u6563\u914d\u7f6e\u4e3a\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f4d\u70b9\u4ea4\u66ff\u589e\u76ca\u548c\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u6216\u5728\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f4d\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u8017\u6563\u65f6\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u76f8\u533a\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u8017\u6563\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u8c03\u6574\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u76f8\u7a97\u53e3\u7684\u5bbd\u5ea6\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8017\u6563\u5728\u91cd\u5851\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u8f6c\u53d8\u65b9\u9762\u8d77\u7740\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u63a2\u7d22\u5f00\u653e\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u68af\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8017\u6563\u5bf9\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u8017\u6563\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u9644\u52a0\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6df7\u5408\u76f8\u533a\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u4e86 Liouvillian \u8d85\u7b97\u5b50\u7279\u5f81\u8c31\u4e0e\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u8c31\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8be5\u5173\u7cfb\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u8017\u6563\u4e0b\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u7acb\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7b2c\u4e09\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u9a6c\u7ea6\u62c9\u7eb3\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u8017\u6563\u914d\u7f6e\uff1a\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f4d\u70b9\u4ea4\u66ff\u589e\u76ca\u548c\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f4d\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u8017\u6563\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u9006\u53c2\u4e0e\u6bd4\u548c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u53c2\u4e0e\u6bd4\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u8017\u6563\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a71\u52a8\u5230\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff1a\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u548c\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u3002\u5728\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u7cfb\u7edf\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u8df3\u8dc3\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u76f8\u533a\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u8017\u6563\u65f6\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u8017\u6563\u540e\u51fa\u73b0\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f4d\u70b9\u8017\u6563\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u5e73\u8861\u8fd8\u662f\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u8017\u6563\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u76f8\u533a\u5747\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u8017\u6563\u5f3a\u5ea6\u53ef\u4ee5\u8c03\u63a7\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u76f8\u7a97\u53e3\u7684\u5bbd\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8017\u6563\u5728\u91cd\u5851\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u8f6c\u53d8\u65b9\u9762\u8d77\u7740\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u5e8f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u663e\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8017\u6563\u4e5f\u80fd\u5728\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6df7\u5408\u76f8\u533a\u3002"}}

An algorithm proposed by Micali and Vazirani (1980) is well-known to solve the problem in $O(m\\sqrt{n})$ time, which is still one of the fastest algorithms in general. While the MV algorithm itself is not so complicated and is indeed convincing, its correctness proof is extremely challenging, which can be seen from the history: after the first algorithm paper had appeared in 1980, Vazirani has made several attempts to give a complete proof for more than 40 years. It seems, roughly speaking, caused by the nice but highly complex structure of the shortest alternating paths in general graphs that are deeply intertwined with the so-called (nested) blossoms.\n  In this paper, we propose a new structure theorem on the shortest alternating paths in general graphs without taking into the details of blossoms. The high-level idea is to forget the alternation (of matching and non-matching edges) as early as possible. A key ingredient is a notion of alternating base trees (ABTs) introduced by Izumi, Kitamura, and Yamaguchi (2024) to develop a nearly linear-time distributed algorithm. Our structure theorem refines the properties of ABTs exploited in their algorithm, and we also give simpler alternative proofs for them. Based on our structure theorem, we propose a new algorithm, which is slightly slower but more implementable and much easier to confirm its correctness than the MV algorithm.\n  As applications of our framework, we also present new $(1 - \u03b5)$-approximation algorithms in the distributed and semi-streaming settings. Both algorithms are deterministic, and substantially improve the best known upper bounds on the running time.

Active learning can reduce annotation costs, but most rely on fixed heuristics and do not ensure that phenotype refinement improves prediction performance. Our goal was to develop a framework that directly uses downstream prediction performance as feedback to guide phenotype correction and sample selection under constrained labeling budgets.\n  Materials and Methods: We propose Reinforcement-Enhanced Label-Efficient Active Phenotyping (RELEAP), a reinforcement learning-based active learning framework. RELEAP adaptively integrates multiple querying strategies and, unlike prior methods, updates its policy based on feedback from downstream models. We evaluated RELEAP on a de-identified Duke University Health System (DUHS) cohort (2014-2024) for incident lung cancer risk prediction, using logistic regression and penalized Cox survival models. Performance was benchmarked against noisy-label baselines and single-strategy active learning.\n  Results: RELEAP consistently outperformed all baselines. Logistic AUC increased from 0.774 to 0.805 and survival C-index from 0.718 to 0.752. Using downstream performance as feedback, RELEAP produced smoother and more stable gains than heuristic methods under the same labeling budget.\n  Discussion: By linking phenotype refinement to prediction outcomes, RELEAP learns which samples most improve downstream discrimination and calibration, offering a more principled alternative to fixed active learning rules.\n  Conclusion: RELEAP optimizes phenotype correction through downstream feedback, offering a scalable, label-efficient paradigm that reduces manual chart review and enhances the reliability of EHR-based risk prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "RELEAP\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0b\u6e38\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u8868\u578b\u6821\u6b63\u548c\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\uff08EHR\uff09\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\uff08EHR\uff09\u8868\u578b\u5206\u6790\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u6ce8\u91ca\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8868\u578b\u6539\u8fdb\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u7528\u4e0b\u6e38\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u8868\u578b\u6821\u6b63\u548c\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u9884\u7b97\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aRELEAP\uff08Reinforcement-Enhanced Label-Efficient Active Phenotyping\uff09\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u3002RELEAP\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u6574\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u67e5\u8be2\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0b\u6e38\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u66f4\u65b0\u5176\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u5728\u675c\u514b\u5927\u5b66\u5065\u5eb7\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08DUHS\uff09\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u53bb\u6807\u8bc6\u961f\u5217\uff082014-2024\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u60e9\u7f5aCox\u751f\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u65b0\u53d1\u80ba\u764c\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5355\u4e00\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "RELEAP \u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u7684 AUC \u4ece 0.774 \u63d0\u9ad8\u5230 0.805\uff0c\u751f\u5b58 C \u6307\u6570\u4ece 0.718 \u63d0\u9ad8\u5230 0.752\u3002\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53cd\u9988\uff0cRELEAP \u6bd4\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u66f4\u5e73\u7a33\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "RELEAP \u901a\u8fc7\u4e0b\u6e38\u53cd\u9988\u4f18\u5316\u8868\u578b\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u624b\u52a8\u56fe\u8868\u5ba1\u67e5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e EHR \u7684\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we benchmark the performance of 25 quantized open-source LLMs across three SBCs-Raspberry Pi 4, Raspberry Pi 5, and Orange Pi 5 Pro-using two inference runtimes: Ollama and Llamafile. We evaluate generation throughput, memory usage, and power consumption under varying CPU configurations, using multiple prompt types to simulate realistic workloads. Our results show that SBCs can reliably support models up to 1.5B parameters, with Llamafile achieving up to 4x higher throughput and 30-40% lower power usage than Ollama. We identify architecture-specific bottlenecks, highlight runtime-level trade-offs, and provide practical deployment recommendations.

Aimed at achieving a similar level of capability in large language models (LLMs) for embodied intelligence, data quality plays a crucial role in training a foundational model with diverse robot skills. In this study, we investigate the collection of data for manipulation tasks using teleoperation devices. Different devices yield varying effects when paired with corresponding controller strategies, including position-based inverse kinematics (IK) control, torque-based inverse dynamics (ID) control, and optimization-based compliance control. In this paper, we develop a teleoperation pipeline that is compatible with different teleoperation devices and manipulator controllers. Within the pipeline, we construct the optimal QP formulation with the dynamic nullspace and the impedance tracking as the novel optimal controller to achieve compliant pose tracking and singularity avoidance. Regarding the optimal controller, it adaptively adjusts the weights assignment depending on the robot joint manipulability that reflects the state of joint configuration for the pose tracking in the form of impedance control and singularity avoidance with nullspace tracking. Analysis of quantitative experimental results suggests the quality of the teleoperated trajectory data, including tracking error, occurrence of singularity, and the smoothness of the joints' trajectory, with different combinations of teleoperation interface and the motion controller.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u7eb5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7ec4\u5408\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u8ba9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5177\u5907\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6280\u80fd\u6570\u636e\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u7eb5\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u517c\u5bb9\u4e0d\u540c\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002\u5728\u8be5\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u52a8\u6001\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u963b\u6297\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\uff08QP\uff09\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u987a\u4ece\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u5947\u70b9\u89c4\u907f\u3002\u8be5\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u80fd\u6839\u636e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5173\u8282\u7684\u7075\u5de7\u6027\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u59ff\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u963b\u6297\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u5947\u70b9\u89c4\u907f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u63a5\u53e3\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7ec4\u5408\u5728\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u5947\u70b9\u53d1\u751f\u6b21\u6570\u4ee5\u53ca\u5173\u8282\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7ec4\u5408\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6536\u96c6\u5230\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u7eb5\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Global temperatures have risen by approximately $0.6^\\circ$C since 1950, extending the window of transmission for mosquito-borne infections and worsening outcomes in diabetes due to metabolic stress caused by heat. People living with diabetes have already weakened immune defenses and, therefore, are at an alarmingly increased risk of contraction of malaria. However, most models rarely include both ways of interaction in changing climate conditions. In the paper, we introduce a new compartmental epidemiological model based on synthetic data fitted to disease patterns of India from 2019 to 2021. The framework captures temperature-dependent transmission parameters, seasonal variability, and different disease dynamics between diabetic and non-diabetic groups within the three-compartment system. Model calibration using Multi-Start optimization combined with Sequential Quadratic Programming allows us to find outstanding differences between populations. The odds of malaria infection in diabetic individuals were found to be 1.8--4.0 times higher, with peak infection levels in 35--36\\%, as compared to 20--21\\% in the non-diabetic ones. The fitted model was able to capture well the epidemiological patterns observed, while the basic reproduction number averaged around 2.3, ranging from 0.31 to 2.75 in different seasons. Given that India's diabetic population is set to rise to about 157 million people by 2050, these findings point to a pressing need for concerted efforts toward climate-informed health strategies and monitoring systems that address both malaria and diabetes jointly.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u5370\u5ea6\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u759f\u75be\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u793a\u611f\u67d3\u98ce\u9669\u9ad8\u51fa1.8-4.0\u500d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6c14\u5019\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u60a3\u6709\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u7684\u5f31\u52bf\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\u759f\u75be\u548c\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u4e4b\u95f4\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u4f20\u67d3\u75c5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u6e29\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u4ee5\u53ca\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u548c\u975e\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u4eba\u7fa4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u75be\u75c5\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u8d77\u70b9\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u975e\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u4eba\u7fa4\uff0820-21%\uff09\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u759f\u75be\u611f\u67d3\u51e0\u7387\u9ad8\u51fa1.8-4.0\u500d\uff0c\u5cf0\u503c\u611f\u67d3\u6c34\u5e73\u4e3a35-36%\u3002\u57fa\u672c\u518d\u751f\u6570\u4e3a2.3\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5b63\u8282\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u4e3a0.31\u81f32.75\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9274\u4e8e\u5370\u5ea6\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u4eba\u6570\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91c7\u53d6\u534f\u8c03\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u3001\u6c14\u5019\u4fe1\u606f\u5316\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u5e94\u5bf9\u759f\u75be\u548c\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u3002"}}

Here, we demonstrate a voltage-controlled magneto-ionic device that functions as a reservoir computer capable of forecasting chaotic time series. The device consists of a crossbar structure with a Ta/CoFeB/Ta/MgO/Ta bottom electrode and a LiPON/Pt top electrode. A chaotic Mackey-Glass time series is encoded into a voltage signal applied to the device, while 2D Fourier transforms of voltage-dependent magnetic domain patterns form the output. Performance is influenced by the input rate, smoothing of the output, the number of elements in the reservoir state vector, and the training duration. We identify two distinct computational regimes: short-term prediction is optimized using smoothed, low-dimensional states with minimal training, whereas prediction around the Mackey-Glass delay time benefits from unsmoothed, high-dimensional states and extended training. Reservoir computing metrics reveal that slower input rates are more tolerant to output smoothing, while faster input rates degrade both memory capacity and nonlinear processing.

These methods typically improve a target output by intentionally degrading another, often the unconditional output, using heuristic perturbation functions such as identity mixing or blurred conditions. However, these approaches lack a principled foundation and rely on manually designed distortions. In this work, we propose Adversarial Sinkhorn Attention Guidance (ASAG), a novel method that reinterprets attention scores in diffusion models through the lens of optimal transport and intentionally disrupt the transport cost via Sinkhorn algorithm. Instead of naively corrupting the attention mechanism, ASAG injects an adversarial cost within self-attention layers to reduce pixel-wise similarity between queries and keys.

This scaling enables previously prohibitive analyses, and we perform two real-world, large-scale new studies of interest to political scientists: we provide the first thorough analysis of the evolution of the #MeToo movement through the lens of over two years of Twitter conversation and a detailed study of social media conversations about election fraud in the 2020 presidential election.

Our system combines a terminology-aware NMT model, adapted via fine-tuning on large-scale synthetic data, with a prompt-based LLM for post-editing. The LLM stage refines NMT output and enforces terminology adherence. We evaluate DuTerm on English-to German, English-to-Spanish, and English-to-Russian with the WMT 2025 Terminology Shared Task corpus. We demonstrate that flexible, context-driven terminology handling by the LLM consistently yields higher quality translations than strict constraint enforcement.

The studied variational quantum gate learning mechanism, which relies on agnostic gradient optimization, does not offer algorithmic guarantees for the correlation of results beyond the measured bitstring outputs. Consequently, existing methodologies are inapplicable to this problem. In this study, we present a classical data-traceable quantum oracle characterized by a circuit depth that increases linearly with the number of qubits. This configuration facilitates the learning of approximate result patterns through a shallow quantum circuit (SQC) layout. Moreover, our approach demonstrates that the classical preprocessing of mid-quantum measurement data enhances the interpretability of quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) outputs without requiring full quantum state tomography. By establishing an inferable mapping between the classical input and quantum circuit outcomes, we obtained experimental results on the state-of-the-art IBM Pittsburgh hardware, which yielded polynomial-time verification of the solution quality. This hybrid framework bridges the gap between near-term quantum capabilities and practical optimization requirements, offering a pathway toward reliable quantum-classical algorithms for industrial applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7ecf\u5178\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u9884\u8a00\u673a\u548c\u6d45\u5c42\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\uff08SQC\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u5178\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u8fd1\u671f\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b97\u672f\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7ecf\u5178\u5230\u91cf\u5b50\u6570\u636e\u6620\u5c04\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e09\u89d2\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u591a\u5143\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5176\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7b97\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u7ecf\u5178\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u8fd1\u671f\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u9884\u8a00\u673a\uff0c\u5176\u7535\u8def\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u6570\u6210\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u6d45\u5c42\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\uff08SQC\uff09\u5e03\u5c40\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ed3\u679c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6765\u589e\u5f3aQAOA\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u8fdb\u884c\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u72b6\u6001\u5c42\u6790\u6210\u50cf\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728IBM\u5339\u5179\u5821\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5728IBM\u5339\u5179\u5821\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ecf\u5178\u8f93\u5165\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u7ed3\u679c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u63a8\u65ad\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u91caQAOA\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u9884\u8a00\u673a\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6d45\u5c42\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\uff08SQC\uff09\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fd1\u671f\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u4f18\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u90e8\u7f72\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

Yet current approaches fall short: neural retrievers lack reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) provide semantic depth but at prohibitive cost, and query rewriting or decomposition limits improvement to static transformations. As a result, existing methods fail to capture the iterative dynamics of exploration, feedback, and revision that complex user queries demand. We introduce Orion, a training framework that enables compact models (350M-1.2B parameters) to perform iterative retrieval through learned search strategies. Orion combines: (1) synthetic trajectory generation and supervised fine-tuning to encourage diverse exploration patterns in models, (2) reinforcement learning (RL) that rewards effective query refinement and backtracking behaviors, and (3) inference-time beam search algorithms that exploit the self-reflection capabilities learned during RL. Despite using only 3% of the training data available, our 1.2B model achieves 77.6% success on SciFact (vs. 72.6% for prior retrievers), 25.2% on BRIGHT (vs. 22.1%), 63.2% on NFCorpus (vs. 57.8%), and remains competitive on FEVER, HotpotQA, and MSMarco. It outperforms retrievers up to 200-400x larger on five of six benchmarks.

We are given multiple agents with hidden values (or quality scores), to whom resources must be allocated by a welfare-maximizing decision-maker. An intermediary with knowledge of the agents' values seeks to influence the outcome of the selection by designing informative signals and providing tie-breaking policies, so that when the receiver maximizes welfare over the resulting posteriors, the expected utilities of the agents (where utility is defined as allocation times value) achieve certain fairness properties. The fairness measure we will use is majorization, which simultaneously approximately maximizes all symmetric, monotone, concave functions of the utilities. We consider the general setting where the allocation to the agents needs to respect arbitrary submodular constraints, as given by the corresponding polymatroid.\n  We present a signaling policy that, under a mild bounded rationality assumption on the receiver, achieves a logarithmically approximate majorized policy in this setting. The approximation ratio is almost best possible, and that significantly outperforms generic results that only yield linear approximations. A key component of our result is a structural characterization showing that the vector of agent utilities for a given signaling policy defines the base polytope of a different polymatroid, a result that may be of independent interest. In addition, we show that an arbitrarily good additive approximation to this vector can be produced in (weakly) polynomial time via the multiplicative weights update method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bf4\u670d\u4e2d\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u7684\u6709\u754c\u7406\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5bf9\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5206\u914d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u6309\u4e3b\u8981\u5316\u516c\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u798f\u5229\u6700\u5927\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u5177\u6709\u9690\u85cf\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65f6\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2d\u95f4\u4eba\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u65ad\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u5f71\u54cd\u9009\u62e9\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8981\u6c42\uff08\u5177\u4f53\u4e3a\u6309\u4e3b\u8981\u5316\u516c\u5e73\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6709\u754c\u7406\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u6ee1\u8db3\u4efb\u610f\u6b21\u6a21\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u591a\u9762\u4f53\uff09\u7684\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6309\u4e3b\u8981\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u5229\u7528\u4e58\u6cd5\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6548\u7528\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5bf9\u4e3b\u8981\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6570\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u8be5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u901a\u7528\u7ed3\u679c\uff08\u4ec5\u7ebf\u6027\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff09\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6548\u7528\u5411\u91cf\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u7684\u57fa\u591a\u9762\u5f62\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e58\u6cd5\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u83b7\u5f97\u4efb\u610f\u597d\u7684\u52a0\u6027\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5728\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bf4\u670d\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5177\u6709\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u90fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

AB3-type intermetallic alloys are promising for solid-state hydrogen storage due to intermediate thermodynamic stability and rapid hydrogen uptake. Optimizing stability and gravimetric density is hindered by competing thermodynamic and magnetic effects. Here, we analyze AB3 compounds (A = Ca, Y, Mg; B = Co, Ni) and ternary alloys CaxYyMg1-x-yB3 using first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. We find a direct correlation between formation energy and total magnetic moment that dictates alloy stability, explaining the trade-off in hydrogen storage. In Co-rich systems with large lattice volumes, formation energy rises with magnetization, showing magnetism as the dominant factor. Mg-rich compositions achieve high gravimetric densities, but strong magnetism destabilizes the system, requiring Y substitution to suppress magnetic moments. Replacing Co with Ni weakens magnetism: YNi3 is nonmagnetic, while CaNi3 and MgNi3 are weakly polarized, allowing thermodynamic stability across compositions. Notably, CaMg2Ni9 combines high theoretical capacity (3.32 wt%) with good reversibility. Mg-rich Ni-based alloys are predicted to offer negative formation energies with the highest gravimetric densities (up to 3.40 wt%). These results show that controlling magnetism via transition-metal substitution is key to overcoming the stability-capacity trade-off in AB3 hydrogen storage materials.", "AI": {"tldr": "AB3\u7c7b\u91d1\u5c5e\u95f4\u5316\u5408\u7269\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u78c1\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u6c22\u50a8\u5b58\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fa\u6001\u50a8\u6c22\u662f\u6e05\u6d01\u80fd\u6e90\u6c22\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4f46AB3\u7c7b\u91d1\u5c5e\u95f4\u5316\u5408\u7269\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u50a8\u6c22\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u6790\u4e86AB3\u5316\u5408\u7269\uff08A = Ca, Y, Mg; B = Co, Ni\uff09\u548c\u4e09\u5143\u5408\u91d1CaxYyMg1-x-yB3\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5f62\u6210\u80fd\u4e0e\u603b\u78c1\u77e9\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u76f4\u63a5\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u5408\u91d1\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u50a8\u6c22\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002\u5728\u5bccCo\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\uff0c\u78c1\u6027\u662f\u4e3b\u5bfc\u56e0\u7d20\u3002Mg\u542b\u91cf\u9ad8\u7684\u5316\u5408\u7269\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u50a8\u6c22\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5f3a\u78c1\u6027\u4f1a\u4f7f\u5176\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u9700\u8981Y\u6765\u6291\u5236\u78c1\u77e9\u3002Ni\u66ff\u4ee3Co\u53ef\u4ee5\u524a\u5f31\u78c1\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97Ni\u57fa\u5408\u91d1\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6210\u5206\u4e0b\u90fd\u5177\u6709\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002CaMg2Ni9\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u7406\u8bba\u5bb9\u91cf\uff083.32 wt%\uff09\u548c\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u9006\u6027\u3002Mg\u542b\u91cf\u9ad8\u7684Ni\u57fa\u5408\u91d1\u9884\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u50a8\u6c22\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff08\u9ad8\u8fbe3.40 wt%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u8fc7\u6e21\u91d1\u5c5e\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u662f\u514b\u670dAB3\u7c7b\u6750\u6599\u50a8\u6c22\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u6743\u8861\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

The two main desiderata of a dynamic set cover algorithm are to minimize at each time-step, the recourse, which is the number of sets removed from or added to the solution, and the update time to compute the updated solution. This problem has been extensively studied over the last decade leading to many results that achieve ever-improving bounds on the recourse and update time, while maintaining a solution whose cost is comparable to that of offline approximation algorithms.\n  In this paper, we give the first algorithms to simultaneously achieve non-trivial worst-case bounds for recourse and update time.

Building upon Pan et al.'s seminal work demonstrating that embeddings from pretrained language models can leak sensitive information, we conduct a comprehensive analysis using the HS3D genomic dataset to determine whether task-specific optimization strengthens or weakens privacy protections. Our research extends Pan et al.'s work in three significant dimensions. First, we apply their reconstruction attack pipeline to pretrained and fine-tuned model embeddings, addressing a critical gap in their methodology that did not specify embedding types. Second, we implement specialized tokenization mechanisms tailored specifically for DNA sequences, enhancing the model's ability to process genomic data, as these models are pretrained on natural language and not DNA. Third, we perform a detailed comparative analysis examining position-specific, nucleotide-type, and privacy changes between pretrained and fine-tuned embeddings. We assess embeddings vulnerabilities across different types and dimensions, providing deeper insights into how task adaptation shifts privacy risks throughout genomic sequences. Our findings show a clear distinction in reconstruction vulnerability between pretrained and fine-tuned embeddings. Notably, fine-tuning strengthens resistance to reconstruction attacks in multiple architectures -- XLNet (+19.8\\%), GPT-2 (+9.8\\%), and BERT (+7.8\\%) -- pointing to task-specific optimization as a potential privacy enhancement mechanism.

DNN verifiers are complex tools, which might contain bugs that could compromise their soundness and undermine the reliability of the verification process. This concern can be mitigated using proofs: artifacts that are checkable by an external and reliable proof checker, and which attest to the correctness of the verification process. However, such proofs tend to be extremely large, limiting their use in many scenarios. In this work, we address this problem by minimizing proofs of unsatisfiability produced by DNN verifiers. We present algorithms that remove facts which were learned during the verification process, but which are unnecessary for the proof itself. Conceptually, our method analyzes the dependencies among facts used to deduce UNSAT, and removes facts that did not contribute.

We implemented our algorithms on top of a proof producing DNN verifier, and evaluated them across several benchmarks.

Given that LLM providers charge based on tokens, these expanded contexts can quickly escalate monetary costs and increase the computational load on LLM services. This paper presents a comprehensive measurement-based analysis of MCP-enabled interactions with LLMs, revealing trade-offs between capability, performance, and cost. We explore how different LLM models and MCP configurations impact key performance metrics such as token efficiency, monetary cost, task completion times, and task success rates, and suggest potential optimizations, including enabling parallel tool calls and implementing robust task abort mechanisms.

True-time-delay (TTD) circuits can realign the frequency dependence but require large delay ranges and intricate calibration, limiting scalability. Another line of work explores one- and two-dimensional array geometries, including linear, circular, and concentric circular, that exhibit distinct broadband behaviors such as different beam-squint sensitivities and focusing characteristics. These observations motivate adapting the array layout to enable wideband-friendly focusing and enhance multi-user performance without TTD networks. We propose a movable antenna (MA) aided architecture based on hierarchical sub-connected hybrid beamforming (HSC-HBF) in which antennas are grouped into tiles and only the tile centers are repositioned, providing slow geometric degrees of freedom that emulate TTD-like broadband focusing while keeping hardware and optimization complexity low. We show that the steering vector is inherently frequency dependent and that reconfiguring tile locations improves broadband focusing.

Task and motion planning (TAMP) methods interleave the two processes of task planning and motion planning to ensure goal achievement and motion feasibility. Within the TAMP context, we are concerned with the mobile manipulation (MoMa) of multiple objects, where it is necessary to interleave actions for navigation and manipulation.\n  In particular, we aim to compute where and how each object should be placed given underspecified goals, such as ``set up dinner table with a fork, knife and plate.'' We leverage the rich common sense knowledge from large language models (LLMs), e.g., about how tableware is organized, to facilitate both task-level and motion-level planning. In addition, we use computer vision methods to learn a strategy for selecting base positions to facilitate MoMa behaviors, where the base position corresponds to the robot's ``footprint'' and orientation in its operating space. Altogether, this article provides a principled TAMP framework for MoMa tasks that accounts for common sense about object rearrangement and is adaptive to novel situations that include many objects that need to be moved. We performed quantitative experiments in both real-world settings and simulated environments. We evaluated the success rate and efficiency in completing long-horizon object rearrangement tasks. While the robot completed 84.4\\% real-world object rearrangement trials, subjective human evaluations indicated that the robot's performance is still lower than experienced human waiters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212(TAMP)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u79fb\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c(MoMa)\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u91cd\u6392\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002TAMP\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u76ee\u6807\u8fbe\u6210\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5730\uff0c\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c(MoMa)\u7684\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u65f6\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u201c\u6446\u597d\u9910\u684c\uff0c\u653e\u4e0a\u53c9\u5b50\u3001\u5200\u548c\u76d8\u5b50\u201d\uff09\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7269\u4f53\u5e94\u653e\u7f6e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLMs)\u7684\u5e38\u8bc6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5173\u4e8e\u9910\u5177\u7684\u6446\u653e\u65b9\u5f0f\uff09\u6765\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u79cd\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u57fa\u5ea7\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u5229\u4e8eMoMa\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u57fa\u5ea7\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6307\u7684\u662f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u64cd\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u201c\u8db3\u8ff9\u201d\u548c\u671d\u5411\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u91cd\u6392\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9a\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5b8c\u6210\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u7269\u4f53\u91cd\u6392\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6210\u529f\u5b8c\u6210\u4e8684.4%\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7269\u4f53\u91cd\u6392\u8bd5\u9a8c\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4e3b\u89c2\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4ecd\u4f4e\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u670d\u52a1\u5458\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684TAMP\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u5e38\u8bc6\u77e5\u8bc6\u5904\u7406\u7269\u4f53\u91cd\u6392\u7684MoMa\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u5305\u542b\u591a\u4e2a\u5f85\u79fb\u52a8\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u573a\u666f\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ecd\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002"}}

Our core finding is that when the behavior policy is factorized - a common scenario where agents act fully or partially independently during data collection - a strategy of partial action replacement (PAR) can significantly mitigate this challenge. PAR updates a single or part of agents' actions while the others remain fixed to the behavioral data, reducing distribution shift compared to full joint-action updates. Based on this insight, we develop Soft-Partial Conservative Q-Learning (SPaCQL), using PAR to mitigate OOD issue and dynamically weighting different PAR strategies based on the uncertainty of value estimation. We provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for this approach, proving that under factorized behavior policies, the induced distribution shift scales linearly with the number of deviating agents rather than exponentially with the joint-action space. This yields a provably tighter value error bound for this important class of offline MARL problems. Our theoretical results also indicate that SPaCQL adaptively addresses distribution shift using uncertainty-informed weights. Our empirical results demonstrate SPaCQL enables more effective policy learning, and manifest its remarkable superiority over baseline algorithms when the offline dataset exhibits the independence structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u52a8\u4f5c\u66ff\u6362\uff08PAR\uff09\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u79bb\u7ebf\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916\uff08OOD\uff09\u8054\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6311\u6218\u3002SPaCQL\u7b97\u6cd5\u5229\u7528PAR\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3OOD\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MARL\uff09\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u5e03\u5916\uff08OOD\uff09\u8054\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u4e25\u5cfb\u6311\u6218\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u90e8\u5206\u52a8\u4f5c\u66ff\u6362\uff08PAR\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u53d1\u8f6f\u90e8\u5206\u4fdd\u5b88Q\u5b66\u4e60\uff08SPaCQL\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528PAR\u51cf\u5c11\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u4ef7\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\u4e0d\u540c\u7684PAR\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "SPaCQL\u5728\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\uff0c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0e\u504f\u79bb\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u5448\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u800c\u975e\u6307\u6570\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u9650\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eSPaCQL\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7acb\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SPaCQL\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7PAR\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u79bb\u7ebfMARL\u7684OOD\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

This letter demonstrates robust ferroelectric switching in 10 nm sputtered AlBScN capacitors with a low coercive field and approximately two orders of magnitude lower leakage than AlScN. Notably, ferroelectric switching was observed at 2.2 MV/cm in capacitance-voltage measurements, and symmetric polarization reversal occurred near 4.6 MV/cm in positive-up-negative-down (PUND) measurements using 2 \u03bcs pulses. Moreover, Weibull analysis revealed a breakdown-to-coercive-field ratio (EBD/Ec) of ~2.2.

The model is pre-trained on 5.5 trillion tokens spanning diverse linguistic, mathematical, scientific, and programming domains using a curriculum-driven data scheduler that gradually changes the data composition ratio. The training system leverages the MuonClip optimizer alongside custom high-performance kernels, including fused PolyNorm activations and the Parallel Muon algorithm, yielding significant throughput and memory efficiency gains in large-scale distributed environments. Post-training employs a three-stage supervised fine-tuning pipeline that successively enhances general instruction adherence, compositional understanding, and linguistic precision.

Current solutions, which have evolved from retrieval using semantic embeddings to more sophisticated structured knowledge graphs representations for improved sense-making and associativity, are tailored for fact-based retrieval and fail to build the space-time-anchored narrative representations required for tracking entities through episodic events. To bridge this gap, we propose the \\textbf{Generative Semantic Workspace} (GSW), a neuro-inspired generative memory framework that builds structured, interpretable representations of evolving situations, enabling LLMs to reason over evolving roles, actions, and spatiotemporal contexts. Our framework comprises an \\textit{Operator}, which maps incoming observations to intermediate semantic structures, and a \\textit{Reconciler}, which integrates these into a persistent workspace that enforces temporal, spatial, and logical coherence. On the Episodic Memory Benchmark (EpBench) \\cite{huet_episodic_2025} comprising corpora ranging from 100k to 1M tokens in length, GSW outperforms existing RAG based baselines by up to \\textbf{20\\%}. Furthermore, GSW is highly efficient, reducing query-time context tokens by \\textbf{51\\%} compared to the next most token-efficient baseline, reducing inference time costs considerably. More broadly, GSW offers a concrete blueprint for endowing LLMs with human-like episodic memory, paving the way for more capable agents that can reason over long horizons.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u7a7a\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8bed\u4e49\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08GSW\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u60c5\u5883\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4f7fLLMs\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u7a7a\u63a8\u7406\u3002GSW\u5728EpBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u9650\u5236\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u5982\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u6216\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u7a7a\u951a\u5b9a\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8bed\u4e49\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08GSW\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e2a\u201c\u7b97\u5b50\u201d\uff08Operator\uff09\u5c06\u4f20\u5165\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4e2d\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u201c\u534f\u8c03\u5668\u201d\uff08Reconciler\uff09\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u6784\u6574\u5408\u5230\u6301\u4e45\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728EpBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u5305\u542b100k\u52301M token\u7684\u8bed\u6599\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cGSW\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8620%\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cGSW\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587token\u6570\u91cf\u6bd4\u6b21\u4f18\u57fa\u7ebf\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8651%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "GSW\u4e3aLLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u60c5\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose ZeroSim, a transformer-based performance modeling framework designed to achieve robust in-distribution generalization across trained topologies under novel parameter configurations and zero-shot generalization to unseen topologies without any fine-tuning. We apply three key enabling strategies: (1) a diverse training corpus of 3.6 million instances covering over 60 amplifier topologies, (2) unified topology embeddings leveraging global-aware tokens and hierarchical attention to robustly generalize to novel circuits, and (3) a topology-conditioned parameter mapping approach that maintains consistent structural representations independent of parameter variations. Our experimental results demonstrate that ZeroSim significantly outperforms baseline models such as multilayer perceptrons, graph neural networks and transformers, delivering accurate zero-shot predictions across different amplifier topologies.

However, due to limited DRAM capacity, long-seuqence LLM decoding on smartphones is constrained by the key-value cache (KVCache), whose memory footprint increases linearly with sequence length. Retrieval-based methods mitigate DRAM pressure by offloading KVCache to flash and retrieving query-relevant entries through cluster-based indexing. Unfortunately, as decoding progresses, KVCache distribution shifts render static or local cluster updates progressively misaligned, excluding essential entries or fetching redundant ones. These issues are further exacerbated by smartphone-specific limitations in bandwidth, IOPS, and memory capacity.\n  We propose DynaKV, the first adaptive KVCache management approach that jointly addresses accuracy and efficiency for long-sequence decoding on smartphones. DynaKV integrates three key techniques: (1) Migration-Free Cluster Adaptation, which adaptively splits clusters during retrieval without incurring additional transfers; (2) Continuity-Centric Flash Management, which co-locates correlated entries and clusters and employs a dual-head layout for efficient updates; and (3) Memory-Efficient Cache Design, which virtualizes cache space across DRAM and flash and extends replacement policies to align with cluster-level access patterns. Evaluations demonstrate that DynaKV improves retrieval accuracy and reduces end-to-end latency compared to state-of-the-art solutions, achieving average gains of $1.38\\times$ in accuracy and $1.47\\times$ speedups. Furthermore, the insights of DynaKV naturally extend to other long-context workloads and multi-tier memory hierarchies, underscoring its broader applicability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u4e0a\u7684\u957f\u5e8f\u5217LLM\u89e3\u7801\u53d7\u9650\u4e8eKVCache\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06KVCache\u5378\u8f7d\u5230\u95ea\u5b58\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7d22\u5f15\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u96c6\u7fa4\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002DynaKV\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94KVCache\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fc1\u79fb\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u96c6\u7fa4\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u4ee5\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u95ea\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5bf9\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u957f\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5bf9LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u4e5f\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u6709\u9650\u7684DRAM\u5bb9\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u957f\u5e8f\u5217LLM\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3aKVCache\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u968f\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\u3002", "method": "DynaKV\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff1a1. \u8fc1\u79fb\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u96c6\u7fa4\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u5206\u5272\u96c6\u7fa4\u800c\u4e0d\u4ea7\u751f\u989d\u5916\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\uff1b2. \u4ee5\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u95ea\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u5171\u540c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u76f8\u5173\u6761\u76ee\u548c\u96c6\u7fa4\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5934\u5e03\u5c40\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b3. \u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728DRAM\u548c\u95ea\u5b58\u4e4b\u95f4\u865a\u62df\u5316\u7f13\u5b58\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u66ff\u6362\u7b56\u7565\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e0e\u96c6\u7fa4\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u5f0f\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cDynaKV\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e861.38\u500d\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e861.47\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "DynaKV\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8054\u5408\u89e3\u51b3\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u4e0a\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94KVCache\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5176\u89c1\u89e3\u81ea\u7136\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u548c\u591a\u5c42\u5185\u5b58\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

While such arrays offer practical advantages in terms of cost and size, existing localization methods suffer from a fundamental limitation: their performance degrades significantly as the source moves into the far-field, a common challenge known as the thresholding effect. To address this issue, we reformulate the localization problem in the modified polar representation (MPR) coordinate system, which parameterizes the source location using its azimuth, elevation, and inverse-range. We have developed a constrained weighted least squares (CWLS) estimator, which is subsequently transformed into a tight semidefinite programming (SDP) problem via semidefinite relaxation, enhanced with additional constraints to improve accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed estimator attains the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for both angle and inverse-range estimation in near-field scenarios. More importantly, it maintains this optimal performance in the far-field, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods, which exhibit significant error at large ranges. The proposed solution thus provides a reliable, unified localization system that is effective irrespective of the source range.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u6781\u5750\u6807\u8868\u793a\uff08MPR\uff09\u548c\u534a\u6b63\u5b9a\u89c4\u5212\uff08SDP\uff09\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u4e09\u7ef4\u58f0\u6e90\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fdc\u573a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd1\u573a\u548c\u8fdc\u573a\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e00\u7ef4\u7ebf\u6027\u9635\u5217\u58f0\u6e90\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fdc\u573a\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5373\u6240\u8c13\u7684\u9608\u503c\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u6781\u5750\u6807\u8868\u793a\uff08MPR\uff09\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7ea6\u675f\u52a0\u6743\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\uff08CWLS\uff09\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534a\u6b63\u5b9a\u677e\u5f1b\uff08SDP\uff09\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675fSDP\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5728\u8fd1\u573a\u548c\u8fdc\u573a\u90fd\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u89d2\u5ea6\u548c\u53cd\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u514b\u62c9\u7f8e-\u7f57\u4e0b\u754c\uff08CRLB\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u5728\u8fdc\u573a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u3001\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u58f0\u6e90\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u58f0\u6e90\u8ddd\u79bb\u5982\u4f55\u90fd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002"}}

Videos, including those of humans or teleoperated robots, capture rich physical interactions. However, most of them lack labeled actions, which limits their use in robot learning. We present Video Prediction for Robot Actions (ViPRA), a simple pretraining-finetuning framework that learns continuous robot control from these actionless videos. Instead of directly predicting actions, we train a video-language model to predict both future visual observations and motion-centric latent actions, which serve as intermediate representations of scene dynamics. We train these latent actions using perceptual losses and optical flow consistency to ensure they reflect physically grounded behavior. For downstream control, we introduce a chunked flow matching decoder that maps latent actions to robot-specific continuous action sequences, using only 100 to 200 teleoperated demonstrations. This approach avoids expensive action annotation, supports generalization across embodiments, and enables smooth, high-frequency continuous control upto 22 Hz via chunked action decoding. Unlike prior latent action works that treat pretraining as autoregressive policy learning, explicitly models both what changes and how. Our method outperforms strong baselines, with a 16% gain on the SIMPLER benchmark and a 13% improvement across real world manipulation tasks.

While several specialised toolkits provide high performance for specific tasks, using existing tools still requires substantial technical expertise. There remains a gap in accessible, integrated solutions that deliver sufficient tracking for non-experts across diverse settings.\n  TrackStudio was developed to address this gap by combining established open-source tools into a single, modular, GUI-based pipeline that works out of the box. It provides automatic 2D and 3D tracking, calibration, preprocessing, feature extraction, and visualisation without requiring any programming skills. We supply a user guide with practical advice for video acquisition, synchronisation, and setup, alongside documentation of common pitfalls and how to avoid them.\n  To validate the toolkit, we tested its performance across three environments using either low-cost webcams or high-resolution cameras, including challenging conditions for body position, lightning, and space and obstructions.

Meanwhile, efforts to interpret their internal mechanisms have emerged, offering insights to enhance multilingual performance. While multi-head self-attention (MHA) has proven critical in many areas, its role in multilingual capabilities remains underexplored. In this work, we study the contribution of MHA in supporting multilingual processing in LLMs. We propose Language Attention Head Importance Scores (LAHIS), an effective and efficient method that identifies attention head importance for multilingual capabilities via a single forward and backward pass through the LLM. Applying LAHIS to Aya-23-8B, Llama-3.2-3B, and Mistral-7B-v0.1, we reveal the existence of both language-specific and language-general heads. Language-specific heads enable cross-lingual attention transfer to guide the model toward target language contexts and mitigate off-target language generation issue, contributing to addressing challenges in multilingual LLMs. We also introduce a lightweight adaptation that learns a soft head mask to modulate attention outputs over language heads, requiring only 20 tunable parameters to improve XQuAD accuracy. Overall, our work enhances both the interpretability and multilingual capabilities of LLMs from the perspective of MHA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faLAHIS\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5206\u6790\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u591a\u5934\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08MHA\uff09\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u901a\u7528\u6027\u4e24\u79cd\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9002\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u591a\u5934\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08MHA\uff09\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3MHA\u5bf9\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLAHIS\uff08Language Attention Head Importance Scores\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u548c\u540e\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30MHA\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u752820\u4e2a\u53ef\u8c03\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9002\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u8f6f\u5934\u63a9\u7801\u6765\u8c03\u6574\u8bed\u8a00\u5934\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "LAHIS\u65b9\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLM\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u901a\u7528\u6027\u4e24\u79cd\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u3002\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u6ce8\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u5883\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u751f\u6210\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u6587\u672c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9002\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728XQuAD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790MHA\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86LLM\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684LAHIS\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9002\u914d\u65b9\u6848\u4e3a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63d0\u5347LLM\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

The magnetic phase of this material has not previously been studied with the field along its magnetisation axis. The measured optical spectra indicate three magnetic phases -- antiferromagnetic, intermediate, and paramagnetic -- where the intermediate phase likely forms a different magnetic structure from typical spin-flop phases. The observed absorptions were classified into two distinct families of optical transitions: single-Nd and two-Nd absorptions. We demonstrate that the optical transitions in the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases can be modelled using a standard single-ion crystal-field Hamiltonian that interacts with a mean magnetisation from the rest of the lattice, and we expand that model to encompass pairs of ions, explaining the origins of the two-Nd transitions.

We survey existing tool features and identify a gap in conflict resolution methods and AI integration. To address this, we propose a framework and implementation design for a novel AI-enhanced tool that assists in dispute investigation. The framework organises heterogeneous artefacts - submissions (code, text, media), communications (chat, email), coordination records (meeting logs, tasks), peer assessments, and contextual information - into three dimensions with nine benchmarks: Contribution, Interaction, and Role.

To enhance CFR's applicability in large games, researchers use neural networks to approximate its behavior. However, existing methods are mainly based on vanilla CFR and struggle to effectively integrate more advanced CFR variants. In this work, we propose an efficient model-free neural CFR algorithm, overcoming the limitations of existing methods in approximating advanced CFR variants. At each iteration, it collects variance-reduced sampled advantages based on a value network, fits cumulative advantages by bootstrapping, and applies discounting and clipping operations to simulate the update mechanisms of advanced CFR variants.

We do a rigorous comparison between two approaches. The first is the classic one in which a system identification stage is used to estimate the unknown parameters, which are then used in a state-feedback LQG (SF-LQG) controller design. The second approach is a recently proposed one using a reinforcement learning paradigm called Q-learning. We do the comparison in terms of complexity and accuracy of the resulting controller. We show that the classic approach asymptotically efficient, giving virtually no room for improvement in terms of accuracy. We also propose a novel Q-learning-based method which we show asymptotically achieves the optimal controller design. We complement our proposed method with a numerically efficient algorithmic implementation aiming at making it competitive in terms of computations. Nevertheless, our complexity analysis shows that the classic approach is still numerically more efficient than this Q-learning-based alternative.

This paper was accepted to the ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA) 2026. This is a pre-print version", "summary": "Reconfigurable networks are a novel communication paradigm in which the pattern of connectivity between hosts varies rapidly over time. Prior theoretical work explored the inherent tradeoffs between throughput (or, hop-count) and latency, and showed the existence of infinitely many Pareto-optimal designs as the network size tends to infinity. Existing Pareto-optimal designs use a connection schedule which is fine-tuned to the desired hop-count $h$, permitting lower latency as $h$ increases. However, in reality datacenter workloads contain a mix of low-latency and high-latency requests. Using a connection schedule fine-tuned for one request type leads to inefficiencies when serving other types.\n  A more flexible and efficient alternative is a {\\em universal schedule}, a single connection schedule capable of attaining many Pareto-optimal tradeoff points simultaneously, merely by varying the choice of routing paths. In this work we present the first universal schedules for oblivious routing. Our constructions yield universal schedules which are near-optimal for all possible hop-counts $h$. The key technical idea is to specialize to a type of connection schedule based on cyclic permutations and to develop a novel Fourier-analytic method for analyzing randomized routing on these connection schedules. We first show that a uniformly random connection schedule suffices with multiplicative error in throughput, and latency optimal up to a $\\log N$ factor. We then show that a more carefully designed random connection schedule suffices with additive error in throughput, but improved latency optimal up to only constant factors. Finally, we show that our first randomized construction can be made deterministic using a derandomized version of the Lovett-Meka discrepancy minimization algorithm to obtain the same result.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\u8303\u5f0f\u2014\u2014\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u610f\u8bc6\u8def\u7531\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8c03\u5ea6\u3002\u6b64\u8c03\u5ea6\u5141\u8bb8\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8def\u7531\u8def\u5f84\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u79cd\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u8861\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u8df3\u6570 h \u4e0b\u90fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6df7\u5408\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u901a\u5e38\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8c03\u5ea6\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0d\u540c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5faa\u73af\u7f6e\u6362\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5206\u6790\u968f\u673a\u8def\u7531\u3002\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\uff1a\u5747\u5300\u968f\u673a\u8c03\u5ea6\u3001\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u968f\u673a\u8c03\u5ea6\u4ee5\u53ca\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8c03\u5ea6\uff08\u901a\u8fc7 Lovett-Meka \u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u53bb\u968f\u673a\u5316\u7248\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\uff09\u3002", "result": "1. \u5747\u5300\u968f\u673a\u8c03\u5ea6\u5728\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u4e58\u6cd5\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65b9\u9762\u6700\u4f18\uff08\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a log N \u56e0\u5b50\uff09\u3002 2. \u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u968f\u673a\u8c03\u5ea6\u5728\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u52a0\u6cd5\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65b9\u9762\u6700\u4f18\uff08\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a\u5e38\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\uff09\u3002 3. \u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8c03\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u7b2c\u4e8c\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e3a\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0d\u540c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u3002"}}

Conventional recommender systems rely on centralized data, a paradigm often incompatible with modern data protection regulations. A novel privacy-preserving recommender system is proposed and evaluated to address this critical issue using Federated Learning (FL). The approach utilizes a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with rich, engineered features from the large-scale ASSISTments educational dataset. A rigorous comparative analysis of federated aggregation strategies was conducted, identifying FedProx as a significantly more stable and effective method for handling heterogeneous student data than the standard FedAvg baseline. The optimized federated model achieves a high-performance F1-Score of 76.28%, corresponding to 92% of the performance of a powerful, centralized XGBoost model. These findings validate that a federated approach can provide highly effective content recommendations without centralizing sensitive student data.

The workflows themselves, however, become increasingly complex in terms of involved components. Furthermore, they are executed on distributed cluster infrastructures, which makes the real-time collection, integration, and analysis of provenance data challenging. Existing provenance systems struggle to balance scalability, real-time processing, online provenance analytics, and integration across different components and compute resources. Moreover, most provenance solutions are not workflow-aware; by focusing on arbitrary workloads, they miss opportunities for workflow systems where optimization and analysis can exploit the availability of a workflow specification that dictates, to some degree, task execution orders and provides abstractions for physical tasks at a logical level.\n  In this paper, we present HyProv, a hybrid provenance management system that combines centralized and federated paradigms to offer scalable, online, and workflow-aware queries over workflow provenance traces. HyProv uses a centralized component for efficient management of the small and stable workflow-specification-specific provenance, and complements this with federated querying over different scalable monitoring and provenance databases for the large-scale execution logs. This enables low-latency access to current execution data. Furthermore, the design supports complex provenance queries, which we exemplify for the workflow system Airflow in combination with the resource manager Kubernetes. Our experiments indicate that HyProv scales to large workflows, answers provenance queries with sub-second latencies, and adds only modest CPU and memory overhead to the cluster.", "AI": {"tldr": "HyProv\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6df7\u5408\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u548c\u8054\u90a6\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5bf9\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u5e76\u4e14\u4e86\u89e3\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u3002\u5b83\u5c06\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7528\u4e8e\u7ba1\u7406\u5c0f\u800c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u89c4\u8303\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u90a6\u67e5\u8be2\u6765\u8865\u5145\uff0c\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6267\u884c\u65e5\u5fd7\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5f53\u524d\u6267\u884c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8bbf\u95ee\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u3001\u5728\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u53ca\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u5173\u6ce8\u4efb\u610f\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u56e0\u800c\u9519\u5931\u4e86\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5206\u6790\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u4f1a\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u89c4\u8303\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u987a\u5e8f\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u903b\u8f91\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u62bd\u8c61\u3002", "method": "HyProv\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u548c\u8054\u90a6\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u3002\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8d1f\u8d23\u7ba1\u7406\u5c0f\u800c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u89c4\u8303\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u800c\u8054\u90a6\u5f0f\u67e5\u8be2\u5219\u7528\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6267\u884c\u65e5\u5fd7\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5e76\u5df2\u5728Airflow\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7cfb\u7edf\u548cKubernetes\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u5668\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHyProv\u80fd\u591f\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5904\u7406\u5927\u578b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u67e5\u8be2\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4e00\u79d2\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u9002\u5ea6\u7684CPU\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "HyProv\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u548c\u8054\u90a6\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u3001\u5728\u7ebf\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u53ca\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u54cd\u5e94\u3002"}}

Model performance rapidly degrades when user attention fluctuates, brain states shift over time, or irregular artifacts appear during interaction. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a user state-aware electroencephalogram (EEG) filtering framework that refines neural representations before decoding user intentions. The proposed method continuously estimates the user's cognitive state (e.g., focus or distraction) from EEG features and filters unreliable segments by applying adaptive weighting based on the estimated attention level. This filtering stage suppresses noisy or out-of-focus epochs, thereby reducing distributional drift and improving the consistency of subsequent decoding. Experiments on multiple EEG datasets that emulate real BCI scenarios demonstrate that the proposed state-aware filtering enhances classification accuracy and stability across different user states and sessions compared with conventional preprocessing pipelines.

Recent work has identified game theory, particularly the concept of Nash Equilibrium (NE), as a key enabler for behavior-aware decision-making. Yet, existing work falls short of fully unleashing the power of game-theoretic reasoning. Specifically, popular optimization-based methods require simplified robot dynamics and tend to get trapped in local minima due to convexification. Other works that rely on payoff matrices suffer from poor scalability due to the explicit enumeration of all possible trajectories. To bridge this gap, we introduce Game-Theoretic Nested Search (GTNS), a novel, scalable, and provably correct approach for computing NEs in general dynamical systems. GTNS efficiently searches the action space of all agents involved, while discarding trajectories that violate the NE constraint (no unilateral deviation) through an inner search over a lower-dimensional space. Our algorithm enables explicit selection among equilibria by utilizing a user-specified global objective, thereby capturing a rich set of realistic interactions. We demonstrate the approach on a variety of autonomous driving and racing scenarios where we achieve solutions in mere seconds on commodity hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u5d4c\u5957\u641c\u7d22 (GTNS) \u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861 (NE)\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6709\u6548\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ea4\u4e92\u51b3\u7b56\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u9700\u8981\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u5bb9\u6613\u9677\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u679a\u4e3e\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u8f68\u8ff9\u65f6\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u3002", "method": "GTNS \u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u6765\u6392\u9664\u8fdd\u53cd\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\uff08NE\uff09\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u65e0\u5355\u65b9\u9762\u504f\u79bb\uff09\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u641c\u7d22\u6240\u6709\u76f8\u5173\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u7528\u6237\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u660e\u786e\u9009\u62e9\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u5404\u79cd\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u548c\u8d5b\u8f66\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cGTNS \u5728\u666e\u901a\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4ec5\u4e3a\u51e0\u79d2\u949f\u3002", "conclusion": "GTNS \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u901a\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002"}}

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring is a powerful tool to stratify the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Current scoring practices require time-intensive semiautomatic analysis of cardiac computed tomography by radiologists and trained radiographers. The purpose of this study is to develop a deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) model to classify the calcium score in cardiac, non-contrast computed tomography images into one of six clinical categories. A total of 68 patient scans were retrospectively obtained together with their respective reported semiautomatic calcium score using an ECG-gated GE Discovery 570 Cardiac SPECT/CT camera. The dataset was divided into training, validation and test sets. Using the semiautomatic CAC score as the reference label, the model demonstrated high performance on a six-class CAC scoring categorisation task. Of the scans analysed, the model misclassified 32 cases, tending towards overestimating the CAC in 26 out of 32 misclassifications. Overall, the model showed high agreement (Cohen's kappa of 0.962), an overall accuracy of 96.5% and high generalisability. The results suggest that the model outputs were accurate and consistent with current semiautomatic practice, with good generalisability to test data.

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in reranking tasks. In particular, Pairwise Reranking Prompting (PRP) has emerged as a promising plug-and-play approach due to its usability and effectiveness. However, the inherent complexity of the algorithm, coupled with the high computational demands and latency incurred due to LLMs, raises concerns about its feasibility in real-time applications. To address these challenges, this paper presents a focused study on pairwise reranking, demonstrating that carefully applied optimization methods can significantly mitigate these issues. By implementing these methods, we achieve a remarkable latency reduction of up to 166 times, from 61.36 seconds to 0.37 seconds per query, with an insignificant drop in performance measured by Recall@k. Our study highlights the importance of design choices that were previously overlooked, such as using smaller models, limiting the reranked set, using lower precision, reducing positional bias with one-directional order inference, and restricting output tokens. These optimizations make LLM-based reranking substantially more efficient and feasible for latency-sensitive, real-world deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6587\u6863\u91cd\u6392\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6587\u6863\u91cd\u6392\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u9650\u5236\u91cd\u6392\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u91c7\u7528\u8f83\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u5411\u987a\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u51cf\u5c11\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\u4ee5\u53ca\u9650\u5236\u8f93\u51fa\u4ee4\u724c\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5728\u6587\u6863\u91cd\u6392\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe166\u500d\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7f29\u51cf\uff08\u4ece\u6bcf\u6b21\u67e5\u8be261.36\u79d2\u964d\u81f30.37\u79d2\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728Recall@k\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u6781\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4ed4\u7ec6\u4f18\u5316\u7684LLM\u6587\u6863\u91cd\u6392\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u5ef6\u8fdf\u654f\u611f\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Rooted in the inviolable fundamental laws of quantum mechanics, QSDC enables ultrasensitive detection of even the faintest eavesdropping attempts, guaranteeing true communication security solely when no interference exists. If eavesdropping or intrusion is detected mid-transmission, the system instantly alerts users and severs data flow, shielding them from unauthorized tracking and mitigating hacker threats. Over two decades, QSDC has seen extraordinary advancements, currently attaining kilobit-per-second transmission over 100 km of commercial optical fiber. However, its practical scalability remains constrained by insufficient transmission rates, a critical bottleneck. Semantic communication, which drastically boosts transmission efficiency by extracting core information features, nevertheless stays vulnerable to malicious intrusions. Integrating these paradigms promises to simultaneously enhance equivalent data rate and security. Herein, we propose and experimentally validate a quantum semantic communication scheme, applying it to 3D point clouds. It achieves a 46.30-fold efficiency gain over direct transmission, surpassing both Wyner and Shannon capacity limits.

Detailed prompting specifying decision partnership and explicitly instructing avoidance of sycophancy, confabulation, solution drift, and nihilism achieved initial partnership state but failed to maintain it under operational pressure. Sustaining protective partnership state required an emergent 7-stage calibration sequence, built upon a 4-stage initialization process, within a 5-layer protection architecture enabling bias self-monitoring, human-AI adversarial challenge, partnership state verification, performance degradation detection, and stakeholder protection.\n  Three discoveries resulted: partnership state is achievable through ordered calibration but requires emergent maintenance protocols; reliability degrades when architectural drift and context exhaustion align; and dissolution discipline prevents costly pursuit of fundamentally wrong directions. Cross-model validation revealed systematic performance differences across LLM architectures.\n  This approach demonstrates that human-AI teams can achieve cognitive partnership capable of preventing avoidable regret in high-stakes decisions, addressing return-on-investment expectations that depend on AI systems supporting consequential decision-making without introducing preventable cognitive traps when verification arrives too late.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u5728\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6218\u7565\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u5728\u4e8e\u4eba\u4e0eAI\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b7\u9636\u6bb5\u6821\u51c6\u5e8f\u5217\u30014\u9636\u6bb5\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c5\u5c42\u4fdd\u62a4\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u7ef4\u6301\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eLLM\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u907f\u514d\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u9057\u61be\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u6295\u8d44\u56de\u62a5\u9884\u671f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6218\u7565\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e90\u4e8e\u4eba\u4e0eAI\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u5230\u6295\u8d44\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf97\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbfLLM\u548c3\u4e2a\u5e02\u573a\u60c5\u666f\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u538b\u529b\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u4fdd\u62a4\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u7ef4\u6301\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eLLM\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1. \u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u5e8f\u6821\u51c6\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u534f\u8bae\uff1b2. \u5f53\u67b6\u6784\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8017\u5c3d\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u751f\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4f1a\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b3. \u5206\u79bb\u7eaa\u5f8b\u53ef\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u7684\u4ee3\u4ef7\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u8ffd\u6c42\u3002\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4eba\u673a\u56e2\u961f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u80fd\u591f\u9632\u6b62\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u7684\u9057\u61be\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e86AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u652f\u6301\u51b3\u7b56\u800c\u4e0d\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u9884\u9632\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u9677\u9631\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u56de\u62a5\u9884\u671f\u3002"}}

Two-dimensional (2D) electrides are layered materials with cationic layers separated by 2D confined electrons that act as anions. This study reveals the unique frictional properties of these compounds and the underlying mechanisms. We establish that interlayer friction correlates with the cationic charges and sliding-induced charge redistribution. Remarkably, the 2D electride Ba2N stands out for its lower interlayer friction than graphene, despite its stronger interlayer adhesion, defying conventional tribological understanding. This anomalous behavior arises from electron redistribution as the dominant energy dissipation pathway. Combining ab initio calculations and deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) simulations, we show that incommensurate twisted interfaces (2\u00b0 < \u03b8 < 58\u00b0) in Ba2N achieve structural superlubricity by suppressing out-of-plane buckling and energy corrugation. Notably, a critical normal load of 2.3 GPa enables barrier-free sliding in commensurate Ba2N (\u03b8 = 0\u00b0), with an ultralow shear-to-load ratio of 0.001, suggesting the potential for superlubricity. Moreover, electron doping effectively reduces interlayer friction by controllably modulating stacking energies in 2D electrides. These findings establish 2D electrides as a transformative platform for energy-efficient tribology, enabling scalable superlubricity through twist engineering, load adaptation, or electrostatic gating.

Power modulation, as an industrial-scale demand-side power management approach, allows aluminium smelters to operate with variable power consumption rates and as such be powered by renewable energy sources. In this way, aluminium smelting cells can be used as a large virtual energy storage to balance power demand-supply and stabilise electrical grids. This paper studies the potential optimal power modulation operating conditions, including time-varying line current and anode-cathode distance (ACD) profiles to maximise the aluminium reduction cell profitability subject to constraints on the cell thermal balance. To deal with the complex cell dynamics which are spatially distributed and multi-timescale, a novel optimisation approach that utilises both reduced-order and detailed models is developed. The results yield insight into the optimal line current and ACD profiles for different power modulation scenarios including the time of use electricity tariff and spot price. These results can form the foundation for further studies into online control policies of aluminium reduction cells.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u94dd\u51b6\u70bc\u5382\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u529f\u7387\u8c03\u8282\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u7535\u7f51\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u7ebf\u7535\u6d41\u548c\u9633\u6781-\u9634\u6781\u8ddd\u79bb\u6765\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5229\u6da6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7535\u6c60\u70ed\u91cf\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u94dd\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u662f\u80fd\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u529f\u7387\u8c03\u8282\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u94dd\u51b6\u70bc\u5382\u80fd\u591f\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u4f5c\u4e3a\u865a\u62df\u80fd\u6e90\u5b58\u50a8\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u7535\u7f51\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u964d\u9636\u548c\u8be6\u7ec6\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7684\u3001\u5177\u6709\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u548c\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u7535\u6c60\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5229\u6da6\u7684\u9633\u6781-\u9634\u6781\u8ddd\u79bb\uff08ACD\uff09\u548c\u7ebf\u7535\u6d41\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u529f\u7387\u8c03\u8282\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u73b0\u8d27\u7535\u4ef7\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u7ebf\u7535\u6d41\u548cACD\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u6df1\u5165\u4e86\u89e3\u4e86\u7535\u6c60\u7684\u70ed\u91cf\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5f97\u51fa\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u94dd\u51b6\u70bc\u7535\u6c60\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Here, we experimentally investigate the thermodynamics of Szilard's engine by implementing two distinct types of backward experiments.

We propose a unifying theoretical framework that characterizes when different bias mechanisms produce quantitatively equivalent effects on model performance. By formalizing biases as violations of conditional independence through information-theoretic measures, we prove formal equivalence conditions relating spurious correlations, subpopulation shift, class imbalance, and fairness violations. Our theory predicts that a spurious correlation of strength $\u03b1$ produces equivalent worst-group accuracy degradation as a sub-population imbalance ratio $r \\approx (1+\u03b1)/(1-\u03b1)$ under feature overlap assumptions.

Rapidly growing demand strains this paradigm, and cloud providers struggle to scale infrastructure at pace. Two advances enable us to rethink this paradigm: small LMs (<=20B active parameters) now achieve competitive performance to frontier models on many tasks, and local accelerators (e.g., Apple M4 Max) run these models at interactive latencies. This raises the question: can local inference viably redistribute demand from centralized infrastructure? Answering this requires measuring whether local LMs can accurately answer real-world queries and whether they can do so efficiently enough to be practical on power-constrained devices (i.e., laptops). We propose intelligence per watt (IPW), task accuracy divided by unit of power, as a metric for assessing capability and efficiency of local inference across model-accelerator pairs. We conduct a large-scale empirical study across 20+ state-of-the-art local LMs, 8 accelerators, and a representative subset of LLM traffic: 1M real-world single-turn chat and reasoning queries. For each query, we measure accuracy, energy, latency, and power. Our analysis reveals $3$ findings. First, local LMs can accurately answer 88.7% of single-turn chat and reasoning queries with accuracy varying by domain. Second, from 2023-2025, IPW improved 5.3x and local query coverage rose from 23.2% to 71.3%. Third, local accelerators achieve at least 1.4x lower IPW than cloud accelerators running identical models, revealing significant headroom for optimization. These findings demonstrate that local inference can meaningfully redistribute demand from centralized infrastructure, with IPW serving as the critical metric for tracking this transition. We release our IPW profiling harness for systematic intelligence-per-watt benchmarking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u548c\u672c\u5730\u52a0\u901f\u5668\uff08\u5982 Apple M4 Max\uff09\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u672c\u5730\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c LLM \u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd9\u6709\u671b\u51cf\u8f7b\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u4e91\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u6bcf\u74e6\u667a\u80fd\u201d\uff08IPW\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8861\u91cf\u672c\u5730\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9 20 \u591a\u4e2a LLM \u548c 8 \u4e2a\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u672c\u5730 LLM \u5728\u5904\u7406 88.7% \u7684\u5355\u8f6e\u804a\u5929\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u67e5\u8be2\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u672c\u5730\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u6548\u7387\uff08IPW\uff09\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u672c\u5730\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5206\u6d41\u6765\u81ea\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740 LLM \u67e5\u8be2\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u4e91\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u9762\u4e34\u6269\u5c55\u538b\u529b\u3002\u5c0f\u578b LLM \u6027\u80fd\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u672c\u5730\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u4e3a\u5c06 LLM \u63a8\u7406\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u672c\u5730\u8bbe\u5907\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u672c\u5730\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e86\u89e3\u5176\u80fd\u5426\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5904\u7406\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u6bcf\u74e6\u667a\u80fd\u201d\uff08IPW\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u672c\u5730\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5373\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9664\u4ee5\u529f\u8017\u5355\u4f4d\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5728\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217 20 \u591a\u4e2a\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u672c\u5730 LLM\u30018 \u4e2a\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u4ee5\u53ca 100 \u4e07\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u5355\u8f6e\u804a\u5929\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u80fd\u8017\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u529f\u8017\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u672c\u5730 LLM \u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u56de\u7b54 88.7% \u7684\u5355\u8f6e\u804a\u5929\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u56e0\u9886\u57df\u800c\u5f02\u3002\u4ece 2023 \u5e74\u5230 2025 \u5e74\uff0cIPW \u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 5.3 \u500d\uff0c\u672c\u5730\u67e5\u8be2\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4ece 23.2% \u63d0\u9ad8\u5230 71.3%\u3002\u4e0e\u5728\u4e91\u7aef\u8fd0\u884c\u76f8\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e91\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u672c\u5730\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684 IPW \u81f3\u5c11\u4f4e 1.4 \u500d\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5730\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5206\u6d41\u6765\u81ea\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0cIPW \u662f\u8861\u91cf\u8fd9\u4e00\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86 IPW \u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u6bcf\u74e6\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002"}}

Compared with existing work that mostly considered either far-field or near-field covert communications, we consider in this paper a more general and practical mixed-field scenario, where multiple Bobs are located in either the near-field or far-field of Alice, in the presence of multiple near-field Willies. Specifically, we first consider a two-Bob-one-Willie system and show that conventional fixed-position XL-arrays suffer degraded sum-rate performance due to the energy-spread effect in mixed-field systems, which, however, can be greatly improved by subarray movement. On the other hand, for transmission covertness, it is revealed that sufficient angle difference between far-field Bob and Willie as well as adequate range difference between near-field Bob and Willie are necessary for ensuring covertness in fixed-position XL-array systems, while this requirement can be relaxed in movable XL-array systems thanks to flexible channel correlation control between Bobs and Willie. Next, for general system setups, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the achievable sum-rate under covertness constraint. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, we first decompose it into two subproblems, corresponding to an inner problem for beamforming optimization given positions of subarrays and an outer problem for subarray movement optimization. Although these two subproblems are still non-convex, we obtain their high-quality solutions by using the successive convex approximation technique and devising a customized differential evolution algorithm, respectively.

Because of their nonlinear, underactuated dynamics and the partial observability of wind fields, prior work has largely relied on model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods to design near-optimal control schemes for station-keeping. These methods often compare only against hand-crafted heuristics, dismissing model-based approaches as impractical given the system complexity and uncertain wind forecasts. We revisit this assumption about the efficacy of model-based control for station-keeping by developing First-Order Model Predictive Control (FOMPC). By implementing the wind and balloon dynamics as differentiable functions in JAX, we enable gradient-based trajectory optimization for online planning. FOMPC outperforms a state-of-the-art RL policy, achieving a 24% improvement in time-within-radius (TWR) without requiring offline training, though at the cost of greater online computation per control step. Through systematic ablations of modeling assumptions and control factors, we show that online planning is effective across many configurations, including under simplified wind and dynamics models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9ad8\u7a7a\u79d1\u5b66\u6c14\u7403\uff08HABs\uff09\u56e0\u5176\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u800c\u6210\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5e38\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u98ce\u573a\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f80\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fd1\u4e4e\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u5b9a\u70b9\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u3002\u672c\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u5b9a\u70b9\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86**\u4e00\u9636\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff08FOMPC\uff09**\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u98ce\u548c\u6c14\u7403\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4f5c\u4e3aJAX\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5bf9\u68af\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u5728\u7ebf\u89c4\u5212\u3002FOMPC\u5728**\u65f6\u95f4\u534a\u5f84\u5185\uff08TWR\uff09**\u65b9\u9762\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684RL\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8624%\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7ebf\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5efa\u6a21\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u7ebf\u89c4\u5212\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u90fd\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5728\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u98ce\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u5173\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7a7a\u79d1\u5b66\u6c14\u7403\uff08HABs\uff09\u5b9a\u70b9\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u56e0\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u98ce\u573a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u800c\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u5e76\u6311\u6218\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u5728HABs\u5b9a\u70b9\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u9636\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff08FOMPC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528JAX\u5c06\u98ce\u548c\u6c14\u7403\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3a\u53ef\u5fae\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u89c4\u5212\u8fdb\u884c\u68af\u5ea6\u57fa\u4e8e\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "FOMPC\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u534a\u5f84\u5185\uff08TWR\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684RL\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8624%\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7ebf\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u7ebf\u89c4\u5212\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u90fd\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u98ce\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "FOMPC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7a7a\u79d1\u5b66\u6c14\u7403\u7684\u5b9a\u70b9\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u4e0eRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cFOMPC\u5728TWR\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u89c4\u5212\u53ef\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

In contrast to typical swarm robotics research, our robots are elongated and exhibit complex kinematics, introducing unique challenges. Despite its relevance to real-world applications such as logistics automation, remote mining, airport baggage transport, and agricultural operations, this problem has not been addressed in the existing literature.\n  To tackle this new class of swarm robotics problems, we propose a purely reaction-based, decentralized swarm intelligence strategy tailored to automate elongated, articulated vehicles. The method presented in this paper prioritizes jackknifing avoidance and establishes a foundation for mutual collision avoidance. We validate our approach through extensive simulation experiments and provide a comprehensive analysis of its performance. For the experiments with a single HAV, we observe that for 99.8% jackknifing was successfully avoided and that 86.7% and 83.4% reach their first and second goals, respectively. With two HAVs interacting, we observe 98.9%, 79.4%, and 65.1%, respectively, while 99.7% of the HAVs do not experience mutual collisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7fa4\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u6765\u907f\u514d\u91cd\u578b\u94f0\u63a5\u8f66\u8f86(HAV)\u53d1\u751f\u6298\u53e0\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u78b0\u649e\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u91cd\u578b\u94f0\u63a5\u8f66\u8f86(HAV)\u5728\u7fa4\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u907f\u514d\u6298\u53e0\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u78b0\u649e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u5728\u7269\u6d41\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u8fdc\u7a0b\u91c7\u77ff\u3001\u673a\u573a\u884c\u674e\u8fd0\u8f93\u548c\u519c\u4e1a\u8fd0\u8425\u7b49\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7eaf\u7cb9\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u3001\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u957f\u800c\u94f0\u63a5\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u9632\u6298\u53e0\u5e76\u4e3a\u907f\u514d\u76f8\u4e92\u78b0\u649e\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5355\u8f66\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c99.8%\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6210\u529f\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6298\u53e0\uff0c86.7%\u548c83.4%\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u5206\u522b\u5230\u8fbe\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u548c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u70b9\u3002\u5728\u53cc\u8f66\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5206\u522b\u4e3a98.9%\u300179.4%\u548c65.1%\uff0c\u540c\u65f699.7%\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u76f8\u4e92\u78b0\u649e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u907f\u514dHAV\u6298\u53e0\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u78b0\u649e\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, we present FlowFeat, a high-resolution and multi-task feature representation. The key ingredient behind FlowFeat is a novel distillation technique that embeds a distribution of plausible apparent motions, or motion profiles. By leveraging optical flow networks and diverse video data, we develop an effective self-supervised training framework that statistically approximates the apparent motion. With its remarkable level of spatial detail, FlowFeat encodes a compelling degree of geometric and semantic cues while exhibiting high temporal consistency. Empirically, FlowFeat significantly enhances the representational power of five state-of-the-art encoders and alternative upsampling strategies across three dense tasks: video object segmentation, monocular depth estimation and semantic segmentation. Training FlowFeat is computationally inexpensive and robust to inaccurate flow estimation, remaining highly effective even when using unsupervised flow networks.

Recent progress has substantially advanced the characterization of magic in many-body quantum systems, with stabilizer R\u00e9nyi entropy (SRE) emerging as a computable and experimentally accessible measure. In this work, we investigate the spreading of SRE in terms of single-qubit reduced density matrices, where an initial product state that contains magic in a local region evolves under brickwork random Clifford circuits. For the case with Haar-random local Clifford gates, we find that the spreading profile exhibits a diffusive structure within a ballistic light cone when viewed through a normalized version of single-qubit SRE, despite the absence of explicit conserved charges. We further examine the robustness of this non-ballistic behavior of the normalized single-qubit SRE spreading by extending the analysis to a restricted Clifford circuit, where we unveil a superdiffusive spreading.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u201c\u9b54\u6cd5\u201d\uff08\u975e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u5668\u4f26\u5c3c\u71b5\uff08SRE\uff09\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7ebf\u8def\u4e2d\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\uff0c\u9b54\u6cd5\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u672c\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5bf9\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002SRE\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u9b54\u6cd5\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u7279\u6027\u503c\u5f97\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86SRE\u5728\u5355\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u5f52\u7ea6\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u4e2d\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u3002\u5728\u7816\u780c\u5f0f\u968f\u673a\u514b\u5229\u798f\u5fb7\u7ebf\u8def\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u5305\u542b\u5c40\u90e8\u9b54\u6cd5\u7684\u521d\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u6f14\u5316\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u54c8\u5c14\u968f\u673a\u5c40\u90e8\u514b\u5229\u798f\u5fb7\u95e8\u548c\u53d7\u9650\u514b\u5229\u798f\u5fb7\u7ebf\u8def\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u54c8\u5c14\u968f\u673a\u5c40\u90e8\u514b\u5229\u798f\u5fb7\u95e8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u5355\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279SRE\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6269\u6563\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u88ab\u9650\u5236\u5728\u5f39\u9053\u5149\u9525\u5185\u3002\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u514b\u5229\u798f\u5fb7\u7ebf\u8def\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u5355\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279SRE\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8d85\u6269\u6563\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63ed\u793a\u4e86SRE\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7ebf\u8def\u4e2d\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u514b\u5229\u798f\u5fb7\u7ebf\u8def\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u5355\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279SRE\u4f1a\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u6269\u6563\u6216\u8d85\u6269\u6563\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u9b54\u6cd5\u8d44\u6e90\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

The AIA Forecaster approach combines three core elements: agentic search over high-quality news sources, a supervisor agent that reconciles disparate forecasts for the same event, and a set of statistical calibration techniques to counter behavioral biases in large language models. On the ForecastBench benchmark (Karger et al., 2024), the AIA Forecaster achieves performance equal to human superforecasters, surpassing prior LLM baselines. In addition to reporting on ForecastBench, we also introduce a more challenging forecasting benchmark sourced from liquid prediction markets. While the AIA Forecaster underperforms market consensus on this benchmark, an ensemble combining AIA Forecaster with market consensus outperforms consensus alone, demonstrating that our forecaster provides additive information. Our work establishes a new state of the art in AI forecasting and provides practical, transferable recommendations for future research.

In this work, we address the evolution of ferromagnetic state upon applying external pressures up to 10.8~GPa using a combined experimental and theoretical study. The standard \\emph{ab initio} Density Functional Theory computation including ionic relaxations grossly overestimates the unit cell magnetization as a function of pressure. In our theoretical analysis we identify two possible mechanisms to remedy this shortcoming. Matching the experimental observations is achieved by a symmetry-preserving adjustment of the sulfur atoms position within the unit cell. Alternatively, we explore various combinations of the exchange and correlation parts of the effective potential which reproduce the experimental magnetization, the structural parameters and the measured optical conductivity spectra.

Many-body decoherence plays a key role in this transition, yet connecting microscopic dynamics to emergent macroscopic behavior remains challenging. Here, in a doubly disordered electron-nuclear spin network, we uncover an emergent decoherence law for nuclear polarization, $e^{-\\sqrt{R_{p}t}}e^{-R_{d}t}$, that is robust across broad parameter regimes. We trace its microscopic origins to two interdependent decoherence channels: long-range interactions mediated by the electron network and spin transport within the nuclear network exhibiting anomalous, sub-diffusive dynamics. We demonstrate the capacity to control--and even eliminate--either channel individually through a combination of Floquet engineering and (optical) environment modulation. We find that disorder, typically viewed as detrimental, here proves protective, generating isolated electron-free clusters that localize polarization and prolong coherence lifetimes. These findings establish a microscopic framework for manipulating decoherence pathways and suggests engineered disorder as a new design principle for realizing long-lived quantum memories and sensors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6838\u6781\u5316\u8870\u51cf\u89c4\u5f8b $e^{-\\sqrt{R_{p}t}}e^{-R_{d}t}$\uff0c\u8be5\u89c4\u5f8b\u6e90\u4e8e\u53cc\u91cd\u65e0\u5e8f\u7535\u5b50-\u6838\u81ea\u65cb\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u901a\u9053\uff1a\u7535\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u4ecb\u5bfc\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u6838\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u53cd\u5e38\u7684\u4e9a\u6269\u6563\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 Floquet \u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u73af\u5883\u8c03\u5236\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u751a\u81f3\u6d88\u9664\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8870\u51cf\u901a\u9053\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u65e0\u5e8f\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u4fdd\u62a4\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5b64\u7acb\u7684\u65e0\u7535\u5b50\u7c07\u6765\u5ef6\u957f\u76f8\u5e72\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u64cd\u63a7\u8870\u51cf\u8def\u5f84\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5fae\u89c2\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5de5\u7a0b\u65e0\u5e8f\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u5bff\u547d\u91cf\u5b50\u5b58\u50a8\u5668\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u539f\u5219\u3002", "motivation": "\u9610\u660e\u53ef\u9006\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5982\u4f55\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u4f53\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u5728\u8fd9\u4e00\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u5fae\u89c2\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u53cc\u91cd\u65e0\u5e8f\u7684\u7535\u5b50-\u6838\u81ea\u65cb\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 Floquet \u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u73af\u5883\u8c03\u5236\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u6d88\u9664\u8870\u51cf\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u65e0\u5e8f\u6027\u5bf9\u76f8\u5e72\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6838\u6781\u5316\u8870\u51cf\u89c4\u5f8b $e^{-\\sqrt{R_{p}t}}e^{-R_{d}t}$\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u5176\u5fae\u89c2\u8d77\u6e90\u4e8e\u957f\u7a0b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u4e9a\u6269\u6563\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u7a0b\u624b\u6bb5\u63a7\u5236\u8870\u51cf\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u65e0\u5e8f\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u5ef6\u957f\u76f8\u5e72\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u64cd\u63a7\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5de5\u7a0b\u65e0\u5e8f\u6027\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u5bff\u547d\u91cf\u5b50\u5b58\u50a8\u5668\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

We focus on robust constrained Markov decision processes (RCMDPs), where the agent must maximize reward while ensuring cumulative utility exceeds a threshold under the worst-case dynamics within an uncertainty set. While recent works have established finite-time iteration complexity guarantees for RCMDPs using policy optimization, their sample complexity guarantees remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we first show that Markovian policies may fail to be optimal even under rectangular uncertainty sets unlike the {\\em unconstrained} robust MDP. To address this, we introduce an augmented state space that incorporates the remaining utility budget into the state representation.

The proposed approach explicitly accounts for the mutual coupling (MC) effect, modeled via scattering parameter multiport network theory. In Stage~I, a dimension-reduced subspace-based method is proposed to estimate the common angle of arrival (AoA) at the BS using the received signals across all users. In Stage~II, MC-aware cascaded channel estimation is performed for a typical user. The equivalent measurement vectors for each cascaded path are extracted and the reference column is reconstructed using a compressed sensing (CS)-based approach. By leveraging the structure of the cascaded channel, the reference column is rearranged to estimate the AoA at the RIS, thereby reducing the computational complexity associated with estimating other columns. Additionally, the common angle of departure (AoD) at the RIS is also obtained in this stage, which significantly reduces the pilot overhead for estimating the cascaded channels of other users in Stage~III. The RIS phase shift training matrix is designed to optimize performance in the presence of MC and outperforms random phase scheme.

However, existing VBTS tactile surfaces make use of silicone gels, which provide high sensitivity but easily deteriorate from loading and surface wear. We propose that polyurethane rubber, used for high-load applications like shoe soles, rubber wheels, and industrial gaskets, may provide improved physical gel resilience, potentially at the cost of sensitivity. To compare the resilience and sensitivity of silicone and polyurethane VBTS gels, we propose a series of standard evaluation benchmarking protocols. Our resilience tests assess sensor durability across normal loading, shear loading, and abrasion. For sensitivity, we introduce model-free assessments of force and spatial sensitivity to directly measure the physical capabilities of each gel without effects introduced from data and model quality.

Frangoudis", "Schahram Dustdar"], "title": "BIPPO: Budget-Aware Independent PPO for Energy-Efficient Federated Learning Services", "comment": "This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "Federated Learning (FL) is a promising machine learning solution in large-scale IoT systems, guaranteeing load distribution and privacy. However, FL does not natively consider infrastructure efficiency, a critical concern for systems operating in resource-constrained environments. Several Reinforcement Learning (RL) based solutions offer improved client selection for FL; however, they do not consider infrastructure challenges, such as resource limitations and device churn. Furthermore, the training of RL methods is often not designed for practical application, as these approaches frequently do not consider generalizability and are not optimized for energy efficiency. To fill this gap, we propose BIPPO (Budget-aware Independent Proximal Policy Optimization), which is an energy-efficient multi-agent RL solution that improves performance. We evaluate BIPPO on two image classification tasks run in a highly budget-constrained setting, with FL clients training on non-IID data, a challenging context for vanilla FL. The improved sampler of BIPPO enables it to increase the mean accuracy compared to non-RL mechanisms, traditional PPO, and IPPO.

Unlike global alignment, fine-grained alignment requires precise correspondence between localized visual regions and textual tokens, often hindered by noisy attention mechanisms and oversimplified modeling of cross-modal relationships. In this work, we identify two fundamental limitations of existing approaches: the lack of robust intra-modal mechanisms to assess the significance of visual and textual tokens, leading to poor generalization in complex scenes; and the absence of fine-grained uncertainty modeling, which fails to capture the one-to-many and many-to-one nature of region-word correspondences. To address these issues, we propose a unified approach that incorporates significance-aware and granularity-aware modeling and region-level uncertainty modeling. Our method leverages modality-specific biases to identify salient features without relying on brittle cross-modal attention, and represents region features as a mixture of Gaussian distributions to capture fine-grained uncertainty. Extensive experiments on Flickr30K and MS-COCO demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across various backbone architectures, significantly enhancing the robustness and interpretability of fine-grained image-text alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u65f6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u533a\u57df-\u8bcd\u8bed\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u5bf9\u591a\u548c\u591a\u5bf9\u4e00\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u663e\u8457\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u7c92\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u533a\u57df\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u8bc6\u522b\u663e\u8457\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u533a\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728 Flickr30K \u548c MS-COCO \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u5927\u5c40\u9650\uff1a1\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u673a\u5236\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff1b2\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u533a\u57df-\u8bcd\u8bed\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u5bf9\u591a\u548c\u591a\u5bf9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u7c92\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u533a\u57df\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u663e\u8457\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5bf9\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b\u5e76\u5c06\u533a\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728 Flickr30K \u548c MS-COCO \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u8457\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u7c92\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u533a\u57df\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

It requires the integration of several capabilities, including multi-step reasoning, cross-document synthesis, and the generation of evidence-backed, long-form answers. Evaluating DR remains challenging because responses are lengthy and diverse, admit many valid solutions, and often depend on dynamic information sources. We introduce ResearchRubrics, a standardized benchmark for DR built with over 2,800+ hours of human labor that pairs realistic, domain-diverse prompts with 2,500+ expert-written, fine-grained rubrics to assess factual grounding, reasoning soundness, and clarity. We also propose a new complexity framework for categorizing DR tasks along three axes: conceptual breadth, logical nesting, and exploration. In addition, we develop human and model-based evaluation protocols that measure rubric adherence for DR agents. We evaluate several state-of-the-art DR systems and find that even leading agents like Gemini's DR and OpenAI's DR achieve under 68% average compliance with our rubrics, primarily due to missed implicit context and inadequate reasoning about retrieved information. Our results highlight the need for robust, scalable assessment of deep research capabilities, to which end we release ResearchRubrics(including all prompts, rubrics, and evaluation code) to facilitate progress toward well-justified research assistants.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aResearchRubrics\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\uff08DR\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u5305\u542b2500\u591a\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u5236\u5b9a\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u7ec6\u5219\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4f9d\u636e\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u5065\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u6982\u5ff5\u5e7f\u5ea6\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u5d4c\u5957\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684DR\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u8861\u91cfDR\u4ee3\u7406\u9075\u5b88\u8bc4\u5206\u7ec6\u5219\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u9886\u5148\u7684DR\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e5f\u672a\u80fd\u8fbe\u523068%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5408\u89c4\u7387\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u9690\u542b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u5bf9\u68c0\u7d22\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86ResearchRubrics\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7814\u7a76\u52a9\u624b\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\uff08DR\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5176\u54cd\u5e94\u5197\u957f\u3001\u591a\u6837\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u6e90\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30DR\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faResearchRubrics\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b2500\u591a\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u5236\u5b9a\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u7ec6\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u6982\u5ff5\u5e7f\u5ea6\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u5d4c\u5957\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684DR\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30DR\u4ee3\u7406\u9075\u5b88\u8bc4\u5206\u7ec6\u5219\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u9886\u5148\u7684DR\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982Gemini\u7684DR\u548cOpenAI\u7684DR\uff09\u4e5f\u672a\u80fd\u8fbe\u523068%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5408\u89c4\u7387\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u9690\u542b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u5bf9\u68c0\u7d22\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u6709DR\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4f9d\u636e\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u5065\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4fc3\u8fdbDR\u7814\u7a76\u52a9\u624b\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002"}}

The control of dominating excitonic shift current is elucidated from excitation density dependent experiments at varying temperatures. A strong decrease in the excitonic contribution beyond a critical fluence of 150microJ/cm^2 is observed at a very low temperature of 20K. This behavior suggests the formation of a new quantum condensate, i.e., the electron-hole liquid, in the regime when the exciton density is overwhelmingly large that the average spacing between exciton pairs is comparable to the exciton radius.

Rather, it is the kurtosis of quanta exchange in the storage and the noise-induced coherence in the leakage mode that become the dominant quantities in controlling the magnitude of ergotropy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u566a\u58f0\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u6c60\u7684\u8154\u8026\u5408\u6709\u9650\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u8ba1\u6570\u7edf\u8ba1\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u80fd\u91cf\u4ea4\u6362\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u6da8\u843d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u6da8\u843d\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u80fd\u91cf\u4ea4\u6362\u7684\u5cf0\u5ea6\u548c\u6cc4\u6f0f\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u8bf1\u5bfc\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6700\u5927\u8f93\u51fa\u529f\uff08ergotropy\uff09\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4ec5\u7528\u5e38\u89c4\u91cf\u5b50\u548c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u566a\u58f0\u8bf1\u5bfc\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u6765\u6536\u96c6\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u9884\u6d4b\u5176\u6700\u5927\u8f93\u51fa\u529f\uff08ergotropy\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5168\u8ba1\u6570\u7edf\u8ba1\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u80fd\u91cf\u4ea4\u6362\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u6da8\u843d\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6700\u5927\u8f93\u51fa\u529f\u3002\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5e38\u89c4\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u548c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8 ergotropy \u72b6\u6001\u3002\u80fd\u91cf\u4ea4\u6362\u7684\u5cf0\u5ea6\u548c\u6cc4\u6f0f\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u8bf1\u5bfc\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u662f\u63a7\u5236 ergotropy \u7684\u4e3b\u5bfc\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u6c60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6da8\u843d\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

A Case Study", "comment": "2 Tables; ML/Big data paper on medical data", "summary": "The integration of advanced analytical tools, including Machine Learning (ML) and massive data processing, has revolutionized health research, promising unprecedented accuracy in diagnosis and risk prediction. However, the rigor of these complex methods is fundamentally dependent on the quality and integrity of the underlying datasets and the validity of their statistical design. We propose an emblematic case where advanced analysis (ML/Big Data) must necessarily be subsequent to the verification of basic methodological coherence. This study highlights a crucial cautionary principle: sophisticated analyses amplify, rather than correct, severe methodological flaws rooted in basic design choices, leading to misleading or contradictory findings. By applying simple, standard descriptive statistical methods and established national epidemiological benchmarks to a recently published cohort study on vaccine outcomes and psychiatric events, we expose multiple, statistically irreconcilable paradoxes. These paradoxes, including an implausible risk reduction for a chronic disorder in a high-risk group and contradictory incidence rate comparisons, definitively invalidate the reported hazard ratios (HRs). We demonstrate that the observed effects are mathematical artifacts stemming from an uncorrected selection bias in the cohort construction. This analysis serves as a robust reminder that even the most complex health studies must first pass the test of basic epidemiological consistency before any conclusion drawn from subsequent advanced ML or statistical modeling can be considered valid or publishable. We conclude that robust methods, such as Propensity Score Matching, are essential for achieving valid causal inference from administrative data in the absence of randomization", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u5982\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5927\u6570\u636e\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u5f3a\u8c03\uff0c\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u590d\u6742\u5206\u6790\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u5148\u9a8c\u8bc1\u57fa\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e\u75ab\u82d7\u548c\u7cbe\u795e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u961f\u5217\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u4e4b\u5904\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u6e90\u4e8e\u672a\u88ab\u7ea0\u6b63\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u4eba\u4e3a\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u6bd4\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e5f\u5fc5\u987b\u9996\u5148\u7b26\u5408\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u624d\u80fd\u4fe1\u4efb\u540e\u7eed\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u968f\u673a\u5bf9\u7167\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u503e\u5411\u8bc4\u5206\u5339\u914d\u7b49\u7a33\u5065\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4ece\u884c\u653f\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u6709\u6548\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5982\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60/\u5927\u6570\u636e\uff09\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u57fa\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5206\u6790\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u800c\u975e\u7ea0\u6b63\u57fa\u672c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u5e94\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u56fd\u5bb6\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e\u75ab\u82d7\u548c\u7cbe\u795e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u961f\u5217\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u77db\u76fe\u4e4b\u5904\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u6e90\u4e8e\u672a\u88ab\u7ea0\u6b63\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e\u75ab\u82d7\u548c\u7cbe\u795e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u961f\u5217\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e0a\u65e0\u6cd5\u8c03\u548c\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4eba\u7fa4\u4e2d\u6162\u6027\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u4fe1\u964d\u4f4e\u4ee5\u53ca\u77db\u76fe\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u90fd\u4f7f\u5f97\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u6bd4\u65e0\u6548\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u6548\u5e94\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u961f\u5217\u6784\u5efa\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u672a\u88ab\u7ea0\u6b63\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5047\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u6700\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5728\u5f97\u51fa\u4efb\u4f55\u57fa\u4e8e\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6216\u7edf\u8ba1\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u4e5f\u5fc5\u987b\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\u3002\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u968f\u673a\u5bf9\u7167\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8bf8\u5982\u503e\u5411\u8bc4\u5206\u5339\u914d\u4e4b\u7c7b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4ece\u884c\u653f\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u6709\u6548\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u662f\u5fc5\u4e0d\u53ef\u5c11\u7684\u3002"}}

The objective is to minimize transmit power while meeting users signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and energy harvesting (EH) requirements. The problem is solved via an alternating optimization framework based on semidefinite programming (SDP), where metasurface tunability follows Lorentzian-constrained holography (LCH). In contrast to traditional beamforming architectures, DMA-assisted architectures reduce the need for RF chains and phase shifters but require optimization under the Lorentzian constraint limiting the amplitude and phase optimizations. Hence, the proposed method integrates several LCH schemes, including the recently proposed adaptive-radius LCH (ARLCH), and evaluates nonlinear EH models and circuit noise effects. Simulation results show that the proposed design significantly reduces transmit power compared with baseline methods, highlighting the efficiency of ARLCH and optimal power splitting in DMA-assisted SWIPT systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u5929\u7ebf\uff08DMA\uff09\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u591a\u7528\u6237\u591a\u8f93\u5165\u5355\u8f93\u51fa\uff08MISO\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5171\u7f6e\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u80fd\u91cf\u540c\u65f6\u4f20\u8f93\uff08SWIPT\uff09\u7528\u6237\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u548c\u6ce2\u675f\u5f62\u6210\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u53d1\u5c04\u529f\u7387\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u7528\u6237\u7684\u4fe1\u5e72\u566a\u6bd4\uff08SINR\uff09\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u6536\u96c6\uff08EH\uff09\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728DMA\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u591a\u7528\u6237MISO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u5171\u7f6eSWIPT\u7528\u6237\u8fdb\u884c\u6700\u4f18\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u548c\u6ce2\u675f\u5f62\u6210\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u53d1\u5c04\u529f\u7387\u5e76\u6ee1\u8db3SINR\u548cEH\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u534a\u6b63\u5b9a\u89c4\u5212\uff08SDP\uff09\u7684\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u53ef\u8c03\u6027\u9075\u5faa\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u7ea6\u675f\u5168\u606f\uff08LCH\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u591a\u79cdLCH\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u534a\u5f84LCH\uff08ARLCH\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u975e\u7ebf\u6027EH\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7535\u8def\u566a\u58f0\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u53d1\u5c04\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u548c\u6ce2\u675f\u5f62\u6210\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728DMA\u8f85\u52a9\u7684SWIPT\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u662f\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fARLCH\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u7a81\u51fa\u3002"}}

In this work, we systematically evaluate the reliability of six widely used reference-free factuality metrics, originally proposed for short-form summarization, in the long-document setting. We probe metric robustness through seven factuality-preserving perturbations applied to summaries, namely paraphrasing, simplification, synonym replacement, logically equivalent negations, vocabulary reduction, compression, and source text insertion, and further analyze their sensitivity to retrieval context and claim information density. Across three long-form benchmark datasets spanning science fiction, legal, and scientific domains, our results reveal that existing short-form metrics produce inconsistent scores for semantically equivalent summaries and exhibit declining reliability for information-dense claims whose content is semantically similar to many parts of the source document. While expanding the retrieval context improves stability in some domains, no metric consistently maintains factual alignment under long-context conditions. Finally, our results highlight concrete directions for improving factuality evaluation, including multi-span reasoning, context-aware calibration, and training on meaning-preserving variations to enhance robustness in long-form summarization.

Although prior research explored scenario generation for military training, pre-LLM AI tools struggled to generate sufficiently complex or adaptable scenarios. This paper introduces a multi-agent, multi-modal reasoning framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate critical training artifacts, such as Operations Orders (OPORDs). We structure our framework by decomposing scenario generation into a hierarchy of subproblems, and for each one, defining the role of the AI tool: (1) generating options for a human author to select from, (2) producing a candidate product for human approval or modification, or (3) generating textual artifacts fully automatically. Our framework employs specialized LLM-based agents to address distinct subproblems. Each agent receives input from preceding subproblem agents, integrating both text-based scenario details and visual information (e.g., map features, unit positions and applies specialized reasoning to produce appropriate outputs. Subsequent agents process these outputs sequentially, preserving logical consistency and ensuring accurate document generation. This multi-agent strategy overcomes the limitations of basic prompting or single-agent approaches when tackling such highly complex tasks. We validate our framework through a proof-of-concept that generates the scheme of maneuver and movement section of an OPORD while estimating map positions and movements as a precursor demonstrating its feasibility and accuracy. Our results demonstrate the potential of LLM-driven multi-agent systems to generate coherent, nuanced documents and adapt dynamically to changing conditions, advancing automation in scenario generation for military training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u6765\u751f\u6210\u590d\u6742\u7684\u519b\u4e8b\u8bad\u7ec3\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u4f5c\u6218\u547d\u4ee4\uff08OPORD\uff09\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4ee5\u5f80AI\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u751f\u6210\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f9d\u8d56\u8017\u65f6\u8017\u529b\u7684\u624b\u5de5\u521b\u5efa\u590d\u6742\u3001\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684AI\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u8fd9\u65b9\u9762\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u8db3\u591f\u590d\u6742\u6216\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528LLMs\u5c06\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0cAI\u5de5\u5177\u53ef\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u4f9b\u4eba\u7c7b\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u9009\u9879\u3001\u4f9b\u4eba\u7c7b\u5ba1\u6279\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u5019\u9009\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c\u6216\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u7528\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6765\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u6309\u987a\u5e8f\u4f20\u9012\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e13\u95e8\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u6587\u6863\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u4f5c\u6218\u547d\u4ee4\uff08OPORD\uff09\u7684\u673a\u52a8\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e86\u5730\u56fe\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u3001\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u3001\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u6587\u6863\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63a8\u52a8\u519b\u4e8b\u8bad\u7ec3\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

This is achieved by analyzing the temporal distribution of brightness events triggered by the apparent motion of stars. The location and polarity of the events are used to infer the apparent motion field of the stars, which is, in turn, employed to estimate the observer angular velocity in the camera frame. This can be converted to the spacecraft angular rates provided an attitude reference. The method is validated through numerical simulation for a synthetic dataset of event streams generated on random spacecraft pointing and rates conditions. The accuracy of the method is assessed, demonstrating its potential to complement or replace conventional rate sensors in spacecraft systems using event camera sensing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u6d4b\u91cf\u822a\u5929\u5668\u89d2\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6052\u661f\u4eae\u5ea6\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u63a8\u65ad\u6052\u661f\u8fd0\u52a8\u573a\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u4f30\u7b97\u76f8\u673a\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e0b\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u89d2\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u822a\u5929\u5668\u89d2\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u822a\u5929\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u8865\u5145\u6216\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u89d2\u901f\u5ea6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u6d4b\u91cf\u822a\u5929\u5668\u89d2\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u671f\u8865\u5145\u6216\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u89d2\u901f\u5ea6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u6355\u6349\u5230\u7684\u6052\u661f\u4eae\u5ea6\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u6781\u6027\uff0c\u6765\u63a8\u65ad\u6052\u661f\u7684\u89c6\u8fd0\u52a8\u573a\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u4f30\u7b97\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u89d2\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u968f\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u89d2\u901f\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u4f30\u8ba1\u822a\u5929\u5668\u7684\u89d2\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u822a\u5929\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7528\u4f5c\u4f20\u7edf\u89d2\u901f\u5ea6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u8865\u5145\u6216\u66ff\u4ee3\u3002"}}

However, the standard rectified linear unit (ReLU) often suffers from inactive or \"dead\" neurons caused by its hard zero cutoff. To address this issue, we introduce N-ReLU (Noise-ReLU), a zero-mean stochastic extension of ReLU that replaces negative activations with Gaussian noise while preserving the same expected output. This expectation-aligned formulation maintains gradient flow in inactive regions and acts as an annealing-style regularizer during training. Experiments on the MNIST dataset using both multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures show that N-ReLU achieves accuracy comparable to or slightly exceeding that of ReLU, LeakyReLU, PReLU, GELU, and RReLU at moderate noise levels (sigma = 0.05-0.10), with stable convergence and no dead neurons observed.

However, they can fall short, especially when required to account for personalization or specific knowledge. In real-life settings, it is impractical to rely on users to detect these errors and request a new response. One way to address this problem is to refine the response before returning it to the user. While existing approaches focus on refining responses within a single LLM, this method struggles to consider diverse aspects needed for effective conversations. In this work, we propose refining responses through a multi-agent framework, where each agent is assigned a specific role for each aspect. We focus on three key aspects crucial to conversational quality: factuality, personalization, and coherence. Each agent is responsible for reviewing and refining one of these aspects, and their feedback is then merged to improve the overall response. To enhance collaboration among them, we introduce a dynamic communication strategy. Instead of following a fixed sequence of agents, our approach adaptively selects and coordinates the most relevant agents based on the specific requirements of each query. We validate our framework on challenging conversational datasets, demonstrating that ours significantly outperforms relevant baselines, particularly in tasks involving knowledge or user's persona, or both.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u540c\u89d2\u8272\uff08\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3001\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff09\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u901a\u4fe1\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u534f\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u77e5\u8bc6\u6216\u7528\u6237\u4e2a\u6027\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6216\u7279\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u7528\u6237\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u7ea0\u6b63\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u54cd\u5e94\u8fd4\u56de\u524d\u8fdb\u884c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u8003\u8651\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8d1f\u8d23\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u9762\uff08\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3001\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff09\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u901a\u4fe1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u67e5\u8be2\u9700\u6c42\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u76f8\u5173\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u77e5\u8bc6\u6216\u7528\u6237\u4e2a\u6027\uff08\u6216\u4e24\u8005\u517c\u6709\uff09\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u786e\u5206\u5de5\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u7279\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\u6216\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

A vision language alignment module produces pixel-level embeddings from polygon semantics; these embeddings guide a conditional image generation framework to respect both spatial extents and semantic cues. VectorSynth supports interactive workflows that mix language prompts with geometry-aware conditioning, allowing rapid what-if simulations, spatial edits, and map-informed content generation. For training and evaluation, we assemble a collection of satellite scenes paired with pixel-registered polygon annotations spanning diverse urban scenes with both built and natural features.

We propose a simple yet effective alternative, Confidence-Aware Preference Optimization (CAPO), which replaces DPO's fixed treatment of preference pairs with a dynamic loss scaling mechanism based on a relative reward. By modulating the learning signal according to the confidence in each preference pair, CAPO enhances robustness to noisy or low-margin comparisons, typically encountered in multilingual text. Empirically, CAPO outperforms existing preference optimization baselines by at least 16% in reward accuracy, and improves alignment by widening the gap between preferred and dispreferred responses across languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "CAPO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6bd4DPO\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684LLM\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982DPO\uff09\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "CAPO\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u635f\u5931\u7f29\u653e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u76f8\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u8c03\u6574\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5608\u6742\u6216\u4f4e\u5229\u6da6\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "CAPO\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u81f3\u5c1116%\uff0c\u5e76\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u504f\u597d\u548c\u975e\u504f\u597d\u54cd\u5e94\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "CAPO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5065\u58ee\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00LLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While satellite-based imaging spectrometers, such as EMIT, PRISMA, and EnMAP, can detect these point sources, current methane retrieval methods based on matched filters still produce a high number of false detections requiring laborious manual verification. This paper describes the operational deployment of a machine learning system for detecting methane emissions within the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) of the United Nations Environment Programme's International Methane Emissions Observatory. We created the largest and most diverse global dataset of annotated methane plumes from three imaging spectrometer missions and quantitatively compared different deep learning model configurations. Focusing on the requirements for operational deployment, we extended prior evaluation methodologies from small tiled datasets to full granule evaluation. This revealed that deep learning models still produce a large number of false detections, a problem we address with model ensembling, which reduced false detections by over 74%. Deployed in the MARS pipeline, our system processes scenes and proposes plumes to analysts, accelerating the detection and analysis process. During seven months of operational deployment, it facilitated the verification of 1,351 distinct methane leaks, resulting in 479 stakeholder notifications. We further demonstrate the model's utility in verifying mitigation success through case studies in Libya, Argentina, Oman, and Azerbaijan. Our work represents a critical step towards a global AI-assisted methane leak detection system, which is required to process the dramatically higher data volumes expected from new and current imaging spectrometers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u90e8\u7f72\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u5e2e\u52a9\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7532\u70f7\u6392\u653e\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u536b\u661f\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u865a\u8b66\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8054\u5408\u56fd\u73af\u5883\u89c4\u5212\u7f72\u7684\u7532\u70f7\u8b66\u62a5\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08MARS\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5339\u914d\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u7684\u536b\u661f\u7532\u70f7\u53cd\u6f14\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u865a\u8b66\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4eba\u5de5\u6838\u67e5\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6210\u50cf\u5149\u8c31\u4eea\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5168\u7403\u6700\u5927\u3001\u6700\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u7532\u70f7\u7fbd\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u914d\u7f6e\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5c06\u865a\u8b66\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8674%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "result": "\u5728MARS\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5904\u7406\u536b\u661f\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6f5c\u5728\u7532\u70f7\u7fbd\u6d41\u4f9b\u5206\u6790\u5e08\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u5feb\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u6790\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u6708\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u4e2d\uff0c\u534f\u52a9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e861,351\u4e2a\u7532\u70f7\u6cc4\u6f0f\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u4fc3\u6210\u4e86479\u6b21\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u901a\u77e5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5229\u6bd4\u4e9a\u3001\u963f\u6839\u5ef7\u3001\u963f\u66fc\u548c\u963f\u585e\u62dc\u7586\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51cf\u6392\u63aa\u65bd\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u7403\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u52a9\u7532\u70f7\u6cc4\u6f0f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u672a\u6765\u9884\u671f\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u536b\u661f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u3002"}}

Here we develop a first-principles-inspired quantum-statistics-based theoretical analysis of the ferroelectric order and interfacial superconductivity in lightly-doped quantum paraelectric, niobium (Nb)-doped KTaO$_3$. We demonstrate that local distortions induced by the doped Nb atoms beyond its quantum critical composition induce a long-range ferroelectric order. The predicted dielectric properties quantitatively agree with the experimental measurements over the entire temperature range from the symmetry-broken ferroelectric phase across the phase transition to the paraelectric region. As the same soft phonon mode that governs dielectric behavior provides the essential pairing channel for interfacial superconductivity of KTaO$_3$, we predict a pronounced enhancement of this superconductivity on (111) surface when the system is tuned to its quantum-critical composition via Nb doping, providing a concrete avenue for experimental verification. This finding establishes ferroelectric quantum criticality as a unique design principle for engineering enhanced superconductivity and discovering emergent quantum phases in polar oxide heterostructures, explicitly suggesting that similar materials-tuning strategies (e.g., epitaxial strain) could be exploited to enhance superconductivity in quantum paraelectric systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u94c1\u7535\u91cf\u5b50\u4e34\u754c\u6027\u5728\u9499\u949b\u77ff\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u4e2d\u50ac\u751f\u4e86\u65b0\u5947\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u94cc\u63ba\u6742\u7684KTaO3\uff08\u4e00\u79cd\u94c1\u7535\u91cf\u5b50\u987a\u7535\u4f53\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u94c1\u7535\u5e8f\u548c\u754c\u9762\u8d85\u5bfc\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63ba\u6742\u7684\u94cc\u539f\u5b50\u5728\u8d85\u8fc7\u5176\u91cf\u5b50\u4e34\u754c\u6210\u5206\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u8bf1\u5bfc\u957f\u7a0b\u94c1\u7535\u5e8f\u3002\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4ecb\u7535\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u6e29\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u7f3a\u7684\u94c1\u7535\u76f8\u3001\u76f8\u53d8\u548c\u987a\u7535\u533a\uff09\u90fd\u975e\u5e38\u543b\u5408\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u9a71\u52a8\u4ecb\u7535\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u8f6f\u58f0\u5b50\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e5f\u662fKTaO3\u754c\u9762\u8d85\u5bfc\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u914d\u5bf9\u901a\u9053\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u94cc\u63ba\u6742\u8c03\u8c10\u5230\u5176\u91cf\u5b50\u4e34\u754c\u6210\u5206\uff0c(111)\u8868\u9762\u7684\u8d85\u5bfc\u6027\u5c06\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u94c1\u7535\u91cf\u5b50\u4e34\u754c\u6027\u5728\u9499\u949b\u77ff\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u65b0\u5947\u96c6\u4f53\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5176\u5bf9\u94c1\u7535\u5e8f\u548c\u754c\u9762\u8d85\u5bfc\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u5bf9\u94cc\u63ba\u6742\u7684KTaO3\u4e2d\u7684\u94c1\u7535\u5e8f\u548c\u754c\u9762\u8d85\u5bfc\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u63ba\u6742\u94cc\u539f\u5b50\u5728\u8d85\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u4e34\u754c\u6210\u5206\u65f6\u4f1a\u8bf1\u5bfc\u957f\u7a0b\u94c1\u7535\u5e8f\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4ecb\u7535\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u543b\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86(111)\u8868\u9762\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4e34\u754c\u6210\u5206\u9644\u8fd1\u8d85\u5bfc\u6027\u7684\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u94c1\u7535\u91cf\u5b50\u4e34\u754c\u6027\u662f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u589e\u5f3a\u8d85\u5bfc\u6027\u548c\u53d1\u73b0\u6781\u6027\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u5f02\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u65b0\u5947\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6750\u6599\u8c03\u8c10\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u5916\u5ef6\u5e94\u53d8\uff09\u4e5f\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u91cf\u5b50\u987a\u7535\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u8d85\u5bfc\u6027\u3002"}}

Positive definite barrier functions, when used in self-tuning super-twisting controllers may introduce some conservatism in relation to initial estimations of the perturbation rate bound. Moreover, discrete time implementation of the algorithm does not necessarily guarantee the boundedness of the closed-loop trajectories when sudden changes in the perturbation occur in between two time samples. The salient features of the proposed methodology pertain to extending the use of positive semidefinite barrier functions to Super-Twisting controller adaptation and the employment of a \"nested barriers\" scheme that ensures boundedness of the solutions even for \"unfavourable\" perturbations-to-sampling time ratios.

The recent Armv9 architecture introduces Scalable Matrix Extension (SME), enabling tile-based matrix operations with high throughput. However, effectively exploiting both SME and traditional SIMD resources for unstructured sparse workloads remains an open challenge. To address this, we propose LOOPS, a hybrid execution framework that combines row-wise CSR-part with vector-wise BCSR-part layout, enabling cooperative utilization of vector instructions (NEON) and Scalable Matrix Extension (SME) resources. LOOPS supports multi-precision SpMM across FP64, FP32, and FP16 via an adaptive two-level parallelization scheme guided by a lightweight performance model.

The UAV is modeled as a variable-speed Dubins vehicle with a line-of-sight sensor in an urban environment that may occlude the sensor's view of the POI. A search strategy is proposed that exploits a probabilistic visibility volume (VV) to plan its future motion with iterative deepening $A^\\ast$. The probabilistic VV is a time-varying three-dimensional representation of the sensing constraints for a particular distribution of the POI's state. To find the path most likely to view the POI, the planner uses a heuristic to optimistically estimate the probability of viewing the POI over a time horizon. The probabilistic VV is max-pooled to create a variable-timestep planner that reduces the search space and balances long-term and short-term planning. The proposed path planning method is compared to prior work with a Monte-Carlo simulation and is shown to outperform the baseline methods in cluttered environments when the UAV's sensor has a higher false alarm probability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6982\u7387\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u4f53\uff08VV\uff09\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u52a0\u6df1 A* \u641c\u7d22\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\uff08UAV\uff09\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u9053\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u641c\u7d22\u79fb\u52a8\u7684\u5174\u8da3\u70b9\uff08POI\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5728\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u89c6\u91ce\u88ab\u906e\u6321\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u9053\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u641c\u7d22\u79fb\u52a8\u5174\u8da3\u70b9\uff08POI\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u89c6\u91ce\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u906e\u6321\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u6982\u7387\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u4f53\uff08VV\uff09\u6765\u89c4\u5212\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\uff08UAV\uff09\u672a\u6765\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8fed\u4ee3\u52a0\u6df1 A* \u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u3001\u4e09\u7ef4\u7684\u6982\u7387\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u4f53\u6765\u8868\u793a POI \u72b6\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u51fd\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u672a\u6765\u4e00\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230 POI \u7684\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6982\u7387\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u6700\u5927\u6c60\u5316\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u53d8\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e76\u5e73\u8861\u957f\u671f\u548c\u77ed\u671f\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u62e5\u6324\u4e14\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u4f53\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u52a0\u6df1 A* \u641c\u7d22\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u641c\u7d22\u79fb\u52a8\u5174\u8da3\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5728\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this work, we establish the complexity-theoretic foundations for the classical intractability of noisy GBS under photon loss, which is a dominant source of imperfection in current implementations. We identify the loss threshold below which lossy GBS maintains the same complexity-theoretic level as ideal GBS, and show that this holds when at most a logarithmic fraction of photons is lost. We additionally derive an intractability criterion for the loss rate through a direct quantification of the statistical distance between ideal and lossy GBS.

LLMs are trained to follow human alignment for safety, and post training quantization(PTQ) is applied afterward for efficiency. However, these two objectives are often in conflict, revealing a fundamental flaw in the conventional PTQ paradigm: quantization can turn into a safety vulnerability if it only aims to achieve low perplexity. Models can demonstrate low perplexity yet exhibit significant degradation in alignment with the safety policy, highlighting that perplexity alone is an insufficient and often misleading proxy for model safety. To address this, we propose Alignment-Aware Quantization(AAQ), a novel approach that integrates Alignment-Preserving Contrastive(APC) loss into the PTQ pipeline. Compared to simple reconstruction loss, ours explicitly preserves alignment by encouraging the quantized model to mimic its safe, instruction-tuned model while diverging from the unaligned, pre-trained counterpart. Our method achieves this robust safety alignment without resorting to specialized safety-focused calibration datasets, highlighting its practical utility and broad applicability. AAQ is compatible with standard PTQ techniques and enables robust 4-bit (W4A4) quantization across diverse model families such as LLaMA, Qwen, and Mistral while maintaining safety where previous methods fail.

Different from rotor swing of SG in traditional grids mainly described by the swing equation (SE), the converter dynamics plays an indispensable role in modern renewable dominated power systems (RDPS). The high complexity of the RDPS, including spatial large-scale, nonlinearity, multi-time-scale, and even sequential switching, prevents us from fully understanding its dynamics and assessing its transient stability under large disturbance. Here, a variety of transient switching mechanism models of renewable devices relying on wind or solar energies under low-voltage ride-through are established and unified, which can be perfectly described by a generalized swing equation (GSE) under parameter changes for switching dynamics. The GSE focusing on the dominant phase-locking loop dynamics is similar to the SE. Mainly relying on the mechanical equivalence and the energy conservative principle, a substantially improved equal-area criterion method is proposed. Based on this method, even for large-scale renewable fields, the calculation errors for the critical clearing time are only about 1%.

We quantify drift across five model architectures (7B-120B parameters) on regulated financial tasks, revealing a stark inverse relationship: smaller models (Granite-3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B) achieve 100% output consistency at T=0.0, while GPT-OSS-120B exhibits only 12.5% consistency (95% CI: 3.5-36.0%) regardless of configuration (p<0.0001, Fisher's exact test). This finding challenges conventional assumptions that larger models are universally superior for production deployment.\n  Our contributions include: (i) a finance-calibrated deterministic test harness combining greedy decoding (T=0.0), fixed seeds, and SEC 10-K structure-aware retrieval ordering; (ii) task-specific invariant checking for RAG, JSON, and SQL outputs using finance-calibrated materiality thresholds (plus or minus 5%) and SEC citation validation; (iii) a three-tier model classification system enabling risk-appropriate deployment decisions; and (iv) an audit-ready attestation system with dual-provider validation.\n  We evaluated five models (Qwen2.5-7B via Ollama, Granite-3-8B via IBM watsonx.ai, Llama-3.3-70B, Mistral-Medium-2505, and GPT-OSS-120B) across three regulated financial tasks. Across 480 runs (n=16 per condition), structured tasks (SQL) remain stable even at T=0.2, while RAG tasks show drift (25-75%), revealing task-dependent sensitivity.

It asks for a distributed algorithm that brings the robots to a common location, not known in advance. We consider the case of robots constrained to move along the edges of a graph under the well-known OBLOT model. Gathering is then accomplished once all the robots occupy a same vertex. Differently from classical settings, we assume: i) the initial configuration may contain multiplicities, i.e. more than one robot may occupy the same vertex; ii) robots cannot detect multiplicities; iii) robots move along the edges of vertex- and edge-transitive graphs, i.e. graphs where all the vertices (and the edges, resp.) belong to a same class of equivalence. To balance somehow such a `hostile' setting, as a scheduler for the activation of the robots, we consider the round-robin, where robots are cyclically activated one at a time.\n  We provide some basic impossibility results and we design two different algorithms approaching the Gathering for robots moving on two specific topologies belonging to edge- and vertex-transitive graphs: infinite grids and hypercubes. The two algorithms are both time-optimal and heavily exploit the properties of the underlying topologies. Because of this, we conjecture that no general algorithm can exist for all the solvable cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728OBLOT\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u521d\u59cb\u914d\u7f6e\u53ef\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u5728\u9876\u70b9\u548c\u8fb9\u90fd\u53ef\u4f20\u9012\u7684\u56fe\u4e2d\u79fb\u52a8\uff09\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u805a\u96c6\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u30022. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5206\u522b\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u7f51\u683c\u548c\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u62d3\u6251\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u805a\u96c6\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u90fd\u662f\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u4f18\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u5e95\u5c42\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u30023. \u57fa\u4e8e\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u62d3\u6251\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u6d4b\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7fa4\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u805a\u96c6\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u79fb\u52a8\u5230\u9884\u5148\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u5171\u540c\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5728OBLOT\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u88ab\u9650\u5236\u5728\u56fe\u7684\u8fb9\u4e0a\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u2018\u654c\u5bf9\u2019\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u521d\u59cb\u4f4d\u7f6e\u91cd\u53e0\u4f46\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u79fb\u52a8\u56fe\u4e3a\u9876\u70b9\u548c\u8fb9\u53ef\u4f20\u9012\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u805a\u96c6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08OBLOT\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u56fe\u8fb9\u79fb\u52a8\u3001\u521d\u59cb\u91cd\u53e0\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\uff09\u7684\u805a\u96c6\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u30022. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u9650\u7f51\u683c\u548c\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u9876\u70b9\u548c\u8fb9\u53ef\u4f20\u9012\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u30023. \u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5206\u6790\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "1. \u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u30022. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u7f51\u683c\u548c\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u805a\u96c6\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728OBLOT\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u2018\u654c\u5bf9\u2019\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u65e0\u9650\u7f51\u683c\u548c\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u805a\u96c6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b97\u6cd5\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5e95\u5c42\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u63a8\u6d4b\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u51b3\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u901a\u7528\u805a\u96c6\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Existing radio access network (RAN) slicing schemes typically optimise isolated layers or objectives, lacking physical-layer realism, slot-level adaptability, and interpretable per-slice performance metrics. This paper presents a joint optimisation framework that integrates Dynamic Hybrid Resource Utilisation with MCS-Based Intelligent Layering, formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that jointly allocates bandwidth, power, and modulation and coding scheme (MCS) indices per slice. The model incorporates finite blocklength effects, channel misreporting, and correlated fading to ensure realistic operation. Two modes are implemented: a Baseline Mode that ensures resource-efficient QoS feasibility, and an Ideal-Chaser Mode that minimises deviation from ideal per-slice rates. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves energy efficiencies above $10^7$~kb/J in Baseline Mode and sub-millisecond latency with near-ideal throughput in Ideal-Chaser Mode, outperforming recent optimisation and learning-based methods in delay, fairness, and reliability. The framework provides a unified, interpretable, and computationally tractable solution for dynamic cross-layer resource management in 5G and beyond networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b35G\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5f02\u6784\u670d\u52a1\u7c7b\uff08eMBB\u3001URLLC\u3001mMTC\uff09\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\uff08QoS\uff09\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RAN\u5207\u7247\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u5b64\u7acb\u5c42\u6216\u76ee\u6807\u65f6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3001\u65f6\u9699\u7ea7\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6bcf\u5207\u7247\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u6df7\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eMCS\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u5c42\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\uff08MILP\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5206\u914d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5207\u7247\u7684\u5e26\u5bbd\u3001\u529f\u7387\u548c\u8c03\u5236\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff08MCS\uff09\u7d22\u5f15\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u5757\u957f\u6548\u5e94\u3001\u4fe1\u9053\u8bef\u62a5\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u8870\u843d\u7b49\u73b0\u5b9e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548QoS\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff09\u548c\u7406\u60f3\u8ffd\u6c42\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6bcf\u5207\u7247\u7406\u60f3\u901f\u7387\u504f\u5dee\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u8d85\u8fc710^7 kb/J\uff0c\u7406\u60f3\u8ffd\u6c42\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4f4e\u4e8e1\u6beb\u79d2\u4e14\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63a5\u8fd1\u7406\u60f3\u503c\uff0c\u5728\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u8fd1\u671f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a5G\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u8de8\u5c42\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We identify key design parameters for mechanical layer jamming systems, including the ability to modulate stiffness, and perform a variety of comprehensive tests placing the specimens under bending and torsional loads to understand the influence of our selected design parameters (mainly tooth geometry) on the performance of the jammed structures. We note the ability of these structures to produce a peak change in stiffness of 5 times in bending and 3.2 times in torsion. We also measure the force required to separate the two jammed layers, an often ignored parameter in the study of jamming-induced stiffness change.

However, existing methods 1) either adopt one-size-fits-all strategies that treat all spatial regions and feature channels equally, which may hinder the preservation of accurate old knowledge, 2) or focus solely on aligning local prototypes with global ones for old classes while overlooking their local representations in new data, leading to knowledge degradation. To mitigate the above issues, we propose Prototype-Guided Calibration Distillation (PGCD) and Dual-Aligned Prototype Distillation (DAPD) for CIMIS in this paper. Specifically, PGCD exploits prototype-to-feature similarity to calibrate class-specific distillation intensity in different spatial regions, effectively reinforcing reliable old knowledge and suppressing misleading information from old classes. Complementarily, DAPD aligns the local prototypes of old classes extracted from the current model with both global prototypes and local prototypes, further enhancing segmentation performance on old categories.

The effects of the predictability of a word given its previous context are generally well-understood in both production and comprehension, but studies of naturalistic production have also revealed a poorly-understood backward predictability effect of a word given its future context, which may be related to future planning. Here, in two studies of naturalistic speech corpora, we investigate backward predictability effects using improved measures and more powerful language models, introducing a new principled and conceptually motivated information-theoretic predictability measure that integrates predictability from both the future and the past context. Our first study revisits classic predictability effects on word duration. Our second study investigates substitution errors within a generative framework that independently models the effects of lexical, contextual, and communicative factors on word choice, while predicting the actual words that surface as speech errors. We find that our proposed conceptually-motivated alternative to backward predictability yields qualitatively similar effects across both studies. Through a fine-grained analysis of substitution errors, we further show that different kinds of errors are suggestive of how speakers prioritize form, meaning, and context-based information during lexical planning.

However, achieving strong and robust macroscopic entanglement remains a long-standing challenge due to the inherently linear nature of the beam-splitter interaction. Here, we propose an experimentally feasible scheme to generate and enhance macroscopic entanglement between two remote magnon modes by injecting squeezed vacuum fields (SVFs) into coupled microwave cavities. We demonstrate that even a single SVF applied to one cavity can induce steady magnon-magnon entanglement, while applying two SVFs (the double-squeezed configuration) enables selective activation of two independent entanglement channels associated with the cavity supermodes. Remarkably, quantum interference between the two SVFs allows for phase-controlled enhancement of entanglement, resulting in significantly improved robustness against cavity dissipation and thermal noise. Under realistic parameters, the survival temperature of quantum entanglement increases from approximately $260$ mK to $450$ mK. Our results open a promising route toward controllable and thermally resilient macroscopic entanglement in cavity magnonics. Our results establish a versatile and controllable approach to generating and enhancing quantum entanglement through double-squeezed-field interference, opening new avenues to study and enhance macroscopic quantum physics in cavity-magnon systems with only beam-splitter interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u5165\u538b\u7f29\u771f\u7a7a\u573a\uff08SVFs\uff09\u5230\u8026\u5408\u5fae\u6ce2\u8154\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u8fdc\u7a0b\u78c1\u632f\u5b50\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u8154\u8017\u6563\u548c\u70ed\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ea0\u7f20\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u6ce2\u675f\u5206\u675f\u5668\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ea0\u7f20\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u957f\u671f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5411\u8026\u5408\u7684\u5fae\u6ce2\u8154\u6ce8\u5165\u538b\u7f29\u771f\u7a7a\u573a\uff08SVFs\uff09\u6765\u751f\u6210\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u8fdc\u7a0b\u78c1\u632f\u5b50\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ea0\u7f20\u3002", "result": "\u5373\u4f7f\u5c06\u5355\u4e2aSVF\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u8154\u4f53\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u78c1\u632f\u5b50-\u78c1\u632f\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u53ccSVF\uff08\u53cc\u538b\u7f29\u914d\u7f6e\uff09\u53ef\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e0e\u8154\u8d85\u6a21\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7ea0\u7f20\u901a\u9053\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u63a7\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bf9\u8154\u8017\u6563\u548c\u70ed\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u751f\u5b58\u6e29\u5ea6\u4ece\u7ea6260mK\u63d0\u9ad8\u5230450mK\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u63a7\u4e14\u8010\u70ed\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ea0\u7f20\u751f\u6210\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u8154\u78c1\u632f\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, most existing approaches rely on simplistic state representations and fuse heterogeneous information via naive concatenation, limiting their ability to capture rich structural and semantic context. To address these limitations, we propose GAMA, a neural neighborhood search method with Graph-aware Multi-modal Attention model in VRP. GAMA encodes the problem instance and its evolving solution as distinct modalities using graph neural networks, and models their intra- and inter-modal interactions through stacked self- and cross-attention layers. A gated fusion mechanism further integrates the multi-modal representations into a structured state, enabling the policy to make informed and generalizable operator selection decisions. Extensive experiments conducted across various synthetic and benchmark instances demonstrate that the proposed algorithm GAMA significantly outperforms the recent neural baselines.

Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) we conducted a first-principles study of the sliding properties of several TMD bilayers: MoS$_2$, MoTe$_2$, WS$_2$, WSe$_2$, VS$_2$, VSe$_2$, TaS$_2$, TaSe$_2$, TiS$_2$, TiSe$_2$, HfS$_2$, ZrS$_2$, MoS$_2$WS$_2$, MoS$_2$VS$_2$. Given the crucial role of van der Waals (vdW) interactions in accurately describing the interlayer interactions in TMD bilayers, we employed vdW-corrected DFT functionals. Our research confirms the dominance of vdW effects by estimating the fraction of interlayer binding energy attributable to these interactions. We also examined how the choice of different vdW-corrected DFT functionals might influence quantitative results. Using MoS$_2$ as a reference TMD bilayer system, we found that most other TMD bilayers studied exhibit stronger interlayer bonds and greater corrugation. However, TiSe$_2$ shows a profile similar to MoS$_2$, while, interestingly, TiS$_2$, VS$_2$, and ZrS$_2$ are characterized by weaker bonding and lower corrugation than MoS$_2$. We explored relationships between various properties of TMD bilayers, with a particular focus on potential connections between tribological and electronic properties often characteristic of solid interfaces. To this end, we evaluated adhesion energies, work of separation, charge density redistributions in interface regions, differential charge densities, and corrugation. While corrugation and thus resistance to sliding generally tends to increase with the size of the chalcogen element and is typically proportional to the adhesion energy, the relationships between other structural, energetic, and electronic properties do not follow a single, well-defined trend.", "AI": {"tldr": "TMDs\u56e0\u5c42\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u6613\u4e8e\u526a\u5207\u800c\u53ef\u7528\u4f5c\u56fa\u4f53\u6da6\u6ed1\u5242\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528vdW\u6821\u6b63\u7684DFT\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u79cdTMD\u53cc\u5c42\u7684\u6ed1\u52a8\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u591a\u6570TMD\u53cc\u5c42\u7684\u5c42\u95f4\u7ed3\u5408\u548c\u6ce2\u7eb9\u6bd4MoS$_{2}$\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46TiSe$_{2}$\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u800cTiS$_{2}$\u3001VS$_{2}$\u548cZrS$_{2}$\u8f83\u5f31\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u7279\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6ce2\u7eb9\u548c\u6ed1\u52a8\u963b\u529b\u901a\u5e38\u968f the size of the chalcogen element \u589e\u5927\u800c\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u7c98\u9644\u80fd\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4ed6\u6027\u8d28\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "TMDs\u56e0\u5c42\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u6613\u4e8e\u526a\u5207\u800c\u53ef\u7528\u4f5c\u56fa\u4f53\u6da6\u6ed1\u5242\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u6ed1\u52a8\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528vdW\u6821\u6b63\u7684DFT\uff08\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u7406\u8bba\uff09\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u79cdTMD\u53cc\u5c42\uff08MoS$_{2}$\uff0cMoTe$_{2}$\uff0cWS$_{2}$\uff0cWSe$_{2}$\uff0cVS$_{2}$\uff0cVSe$_{2}$\uff0cTaS$_{2}$\uff0cTaSe$_{2}$\uff0cTiS$_{2}$\uff0cTiSe$_{2}$\uff0cHfS$_{2}$\uff0cZrS$_{2}$\uff0cMoS$_{2}$WS$_{2}$\uff0cMoS$_{2}$VS$_{2}$\uff09\u7684\u6ed1\u52a8\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86vdW\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5728\u5c42\u95f4\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7c98\u9644\u80fd\u3001\u5206\u79bb\u529f\u3001\u754c\u9762\u7535\u8377\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u5dee\u5206\u7535\u8377\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u6ce2\u7eb9\u7b49\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0e\u6ed1\u52a8\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u591a\u6570TMD\u53cc\u5c42\uff08\u9664TiSe$_{2}$\u5916\uff09\u6bd4MoS$_{2}$\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5c42\u95f4\u7ed3\u5408\u548c\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6ce2\u7eb9\u3002TiS$_{2}$\u3001VS$_{2}$\u548cZrS$_{2}$\u7684\u5c42\u95f4\u7ed3\u5408\u548c\u6ce2\u7eb9\u6bd4MoS$_{2}$\u5f31\u3002\u6ce2\u7eb9\u548c\u6ed1\u52a8\u963b\u529b\u901a\u5e38\u968f the size of the chalcogen element \u589e\u5927\u800c\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u7c98\u9644\u80fd\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4ed6\u6027\u8d28\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "vdW\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9TMD\u53cc\u5c42\u7684\u6ed1\u52a8\u7279\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002TMD\u53cc\u5c42\u7684\u6ed1\u52a8\u7279\u6027\u53d7\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6027\u8d28\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u5e76\u975e\u6240\u6709\u6027\u8d28\u90fd\u9075\u5faa\u5355\u4e00\u7684\u660e\u786e\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002"}}

Although such phenomena have been demonstrated in non-equilibrium settings, their use for fluctuation engineering has been put forth in Raman-cavity hybrids only recently. In this work, we generalize fluctuation engineering to a multi-mode scenario in which multiple Raman-active modes interact nonlinearly with multiple cavity modes. We demonstrate the emergence of resonant and non-resonant collective fluctuations that can be non-reciprocally controlled by engineering the band dispersion of photons and phonons. As an example we show how Raman fluctuations can be selectively attenuated by tuning the photonic bandgap or even nonresonantly amplified, in marked contrast to the single-mode scenario. We also identify a regime in which the amplification of cavity fluctuations in a specific mode is boosted, surpassing a $\\sqrt{N}$ scaling with increasing number of $N$ Raman and cavity modes. Our study reveals the key role of multi-mode interactions on fluctuations in nonlinear cavity-matter hybrids.

We propose Homogeneous Expert Routing (HER), an MoE layer for Heterogeneous Graph Transformers (HGT) that stochastically masks type embeddings during routing to encourage type-agnostic specialization. Evaluated on IMDB, ACM, and DBLP for link prediction, HER consistently outperforms standard HGT and a type-separated MoE baseline. Analysis on IMDB shows HER experts specialize by semantic patterns (e.g., movie genres) rather than node types, confirming routing is driven by latent semantics.

The scheduler, at the heart of Kubernetes' architecture, determines the placement of pods given their priority and resource requirements on cluster nodes. To quickly allocate pods, the scheduler uses lightweight heuristics that can lead to suboptimal placements and resource fragmentation, preventing allocations of otherwise deployable pods on the available nodes.\n  We propose the usage of constraint programming to find the optimal allocation of pods satisfying all their priorities and resource requests. Implementation-wise, our solution comes as a plug-in to the default scheduler that operates as a fallback mechanism when some pods cannot be allocated. Using the OR-Tools constraint solver, our experiments on small-to-mid-sized clusters indicate that, within a 1-second scheduling window, our approach places more higher-priority pods than the default scheduler (possibly demonstrating allocation optimality) in over 44\\% of realisable allocation scenarios where the default scheduler fails, while certifying that the default scheduler's placement is already optimal in over 19\\% of scenarios.

The emergence of generative AI has catalyzed generative semantic communications, where receivers reconstruct content from minimal semantic cues by leveraging learned priors. Among generative approaches, diffusion models stand out for their superior generation quality, stable training dynamics, and rigorous theoretical foundations. However, the field currently lacks systematic guidance connecting diffusion techniques to communication system design, forcing researchers to navigate disparate literatures. This article provides the first comprehensive tutorial on diffusion models for generative semantic communications. We present score-based diffusion foundations and systematically review three technical pillars: conditional diffusion for controllable generation, efficient diffusion for accelerated inference, and generalized diffusion for cross-domain adaptation. In addition, we introduce an inverse problem perspective that reformulates semantic decoding as posterior inference, bridging semantic communications with computational imaging. Through analysis of human-centric, machine-centric, and agent-centric scenarios, we illustrate how diffusion models enable extreme compression while maintaining semantic fidelity and robustness. By bridging generative AI innovations with communication system design, this article aims to establish diffusion models as foundational components of next-generation wireless networks and beyond.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u673a\u9047\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6781\u9ad8\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u6210\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d8b\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\u5bb9\u91cf\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u6bd4\u7279\u4f20\u8f93\u8f6c\u5411\u4ee5\u610f\u4e49\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u800c\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u6559\u7a0b\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u652f\u67f1\uff1a\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u6563\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u901f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u7528\u6269\u6563\u7528\u4e8e\u8de8\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u7801\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u540e\u9a8c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u50cf\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3001\u4ee5\u673a\u5668\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548c\u4ee5\u4ee3\u7406\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6781\u7aef\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u786e\u7acb\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u9886\u57df\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u3002"}}

Bio-inspired musculoskeletal robots, which integrate rigid skeletons with soft actuators, combine high load-bearing capacity with inherent flexibility. Although actuation dynamics have been studied through experimental methods and surrogate models, accurate and effective modeling and simulation remain a significant challenge, especially for large-scale hybrid rigid--soft robots with continuously distributed mass, kinematic loops, and diverse motion modes. To address these challenges, we propose EquiMus, an energy-equivalent dynamic modeling framework and MuJoCo-based simulation for musculoskeletal rigid--soft hybrid robots with linear elastic actuators. The equivalence and effectiveness of the proposed approach are validated and examined through both simulations and real-world experiments on a bionic robotic leg.

On ImageNet with LaVAN multi-patch attacks, Filtered-ViT achieves 79.8% clean accuracy and 46.3% robust accuracy under four simultaneous 1\\% patches, outperforming existing defenses. Beyond synthetic benchmarks, a real-world case study on radiographic medical imagery shows that Filtered-ViT mitigates natural artifacts such as occlusions and scanner noise without degrading diagnostic content.

High-quality domain-specific training demonstrates significant advantages in insurance vertical scenarios but exhibits shortcomings in business adaptation and compliance. The evaluation also accurately identifies the common bottlenecks of current large models in professional scenarios such as insurance actuarial, underwriting and claim settlement reasoning, and compliant marketing copywriting. The establishment of CUFEInse not only fills the gap in professional evaluation benchmarks for the insurance field, providing academia and industry with a professional, systematic, and authoritative evaluation tool, but also its construction concept and methodology offer important references for the evaluation paradigm of large models in vertical fields, serving as an authoritative reference for academic model optimization and industrial model selection. Finally, the paper looks forward to the future iteration direction of the evaluation benchmark and the core development direction of \"domain adaptation + reasoning enhancement\" for insurance large models.", "AI": {"tldr": "CUFEInse v1.0\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u4fdd\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b5\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ef4\u5ea6\u300154\u4e2a\u5b50\u6307\u6807\u548c14,430\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e86\u4fdd\u9669\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u884c\u4e1a\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u5bf911\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7cbe\u7b97\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u5728\u4fdd\u9669\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e1a\u52a1\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u5f85\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002CUFEInse\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u4fdd\u9669\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u3002\u672a\u6765\u5c06\u7ee7\u7eed\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5173\u6ce8\u4fdd\u9669\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u201c\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94+\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u201d\u3002", "motivation": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e1a\u7684\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u3001\u6743\u5a01\u7684\u4fdd\u9669\u9886\u57df\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b66\u672f\u754c\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u754c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u4fdd\u9669\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": " CUFEInse v1.0\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u9075\u5faa\u201c\u5b9a\u91cf\u5bfc\u5411\u3001\u4e13\u5bb6\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u591a\u91cd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u201d\u7684\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5305\u542b5\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ef4\u5ea6\u300154\u4e2a\u5b50\u6307\u6807\u548c14,430\u4e2a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u4fdd\u9669\u7406\u8bba\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u884c\u4e1a\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u5e94\u7528\u4ee5\u53ca\u903b\u8f91\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf911\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u7528\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u9669\u7cbe\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u666e\u904d\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u9669\u5782\u76f4\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e1a\u52a1\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u8bc4\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u9669\u7cbe\u7b97\u3001\u6838\u4fdd\u7406\u8d54\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5408\u89c4\u8425\u9500\u6587\u6848\u7b49\u4e13\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u5171\u6027\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "conclusion": "CUFEInse v1.0\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u586b\u8865\u4fdd\u9669\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u7a7a\u767d\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b66\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6743\u5a01\u53c2\u8003\u3002\u5176\u6784\u5efa\u7406\u5ff5\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u4e5f\u4e3a\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u8303\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u501f\u9274\u3002\u672a\u6765\uff0c\u8be5\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u5c06\u6301\u7eed\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0c\u5e76\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u4fdd\u9669\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u201c\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u201d\u548c\u201c\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u201d\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

We find that collective effects dramatically alter the interplay of electronic, vibrational and cavity angular momenta, giving rise to markedly different polaritonic spectra and dynamics even when going from one to two JT molecules. Starting from the ground vibronic state, we find that JT molecules collectively coupled to a common cavity can access a cascade of high-angular-momentum vibronic states in the presence of a single cavity photon, in sharp contrast to the single molecule case where the range of accessible vibronic angular momentum values are bounded. The observable consequences are a broadening of the cavity-molecular polariton spectrum and a suppression of photon polarization dynamics under broadband excitation of the system.

This is the extended preprint version including appendices", "summary": "Large language models now draft news, legal analyses, and software code with human-level fluency. At the same time, regulations such as the EU AI Act mandate that each synthetic passage carry an imperceptible, machine-verifiable mark for provenance. Conventional logit-based watermarks satisfy this requirement by selecting a pseudorandom green vocabulary at every decoding step and boosting its logits, yet the random split can exclude the highest-probability token and thus erode fluency. WaterMod mitigates this limitation through a probability-aware modular rule. The vocabulary is first sorted in descending model probability; the resulting ranks are then partitioned by the residue rank mod k, which distributes adjacent-and therefore semantically similar-tokens across different classes. A fixed bias of small magnitude is applied to one selected class. In the zero-bit setting (k=2), an entropy-adaptive gate selects either the even or the odd parity as the green list. Because the top two ranks fall into different parities, this choice embeds a detectable signal while guaranteeing that at least one high-probability token remains available for sampling. In the multi-bit regime (k>2), the current payload digit d selects the color class whose ranks satisfy rank mod k = d. Biasing the logits of that class embeds exactly one base-k digit per decoding step, thereby enabling fine-grained provenance tracing. The same modular arithmetic therefore supports both binary attribution and rich payloads. Experimental results demonstrate that WaterMod consistently attains strong watermark detection performance while maintaining generation quality in both zero-bit and multi-bit settings.

This work addresses this out-of-distribution (OOD) challenge by building a domain-specific time-series foundation model (PE-TSFM) that learns representations directly from large-scale unlabeled converter data. Unlike generic TSFMs trained on broad time-series datasets, the proposed PE-TSFM is pre-trained entirely on domain data, enabling it to learn the physical relationships unique to power electronics. To further tailor the model to this domain, we introduce a dual-attention mechanism that captures both temporal patterns and inter-channel dependencies. While generic TSFMs primarily model temporal dependencies, the added channel attention captures inter-sensor physical relationships essential for converter degradation analysis. A dataset containing 141 million unlabeled timestamps from an operating power converter is used for pre-training. Experiments show that PE-TSFM achieves 92% accuracy under unseen operating conditions. In contrast, generic TSFMs achieve around 60% and conventional time-series models achieve around 40% accuracy. This result confirms the strong OOD generalization of the proposed PE-TSFM. Ablation studies further verify that the introduced channel attention mechanism significantly improves model performance. In addition, we conduct detailed studies on model scalability, hyperparameter sensitivity, and interpretability to provide a comprehensive understanding of the proposed approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u7535\u529b\u7535\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u3001\u540d\u4e3aPE-TSFM\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6d77\u91cf\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u201c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u201d\uff08OOD\uff09\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u53cc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u901a\u9053\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u9000\u5316\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cPE-TSFM\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8692%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7ea660%\uff09\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7ea640%\uff09\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5f3a\u5927\u7684OOD\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7535\u529b\u7535\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u5206\u5e03\u5916\uff0cOOD\uff09\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08PE-TSFM\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u53cc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u9996\u5148\u5728\u5305\u542b1.41\u4ebf\u4e2a\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u7684\u7535\u529b\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u7535\u529b\u7535\u5b50\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5229\u7528\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6765\u6355\u6349\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cPE-TSFM\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8692%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u901a\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7ea6\u4e3a60%\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7ea6\u4e3a40%\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684PE-TSFM\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u7535\u529b\u7535\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684OOD\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u53cc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

In this paper, we consider a monostatic sensing scenario in which OFDM is used for the downlink and its reflected echo signal is used for sensing. OFDM and discrete Fourier transform-spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM) are the options for uplink transmission. When OFDM is used in the uplink, the power difference between this signal and the echo signal leads to a power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) scenario. In contrast, adopting DFT-s-OFDM as uplink signal enables a waveform-domain NOMA(WD-NOMA). Affine frequency-division multiplexing (AFDM) and orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) have been proven to be DFT-s-OFDM based waveforms. This work focuses on such a WD-NOMA system, where AFDM or OTFS is used as uplink waveform and OFDM is employed for downlink transmission and sensing. We show that the OFDM signal exhibits additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)-like behavior in the affine domain, allowing it to be modeled as white noise in uplink symbol detection. To enable accurate data detection performance, an AFDM frame design and a noise power estimation (NPE) method are developed. Furthermore, a two-dimensional orthogonal matching pursuit (2D-OMP) algorithm is applied for sensing by iteratively identifying delay-Doppler components of each target. Simulation results demonstrate that the WD-NOMA ISAC system, employing either AFDM or OTFS, outperforms the PD-NOMA ISAC system that uses only the OFDM waveform in terms of bit error rate (BER) performance.

Model-based locomotion approaches typically adopt heuristic methods or planning based on the linear inverted pendulum model. These methods account for linear velocity in footstep planning, while excluding angular velocity, which leads to angular momentum being handled exclusively via ground reaction force (GRF). Footstep planning based on MPC that takes angular velocity into account recasts the angular momentum control problem as a dual-input approach that coordinates GRFs and footstep placement, instead of optimizing GRFs alone, thereby improving tracking performance. A mutual-feedback loop couples the footstep planner and the GRF MPC, with each using the other's solution to iteratively update footsteps and GRFs. The use of optimal solutions reduces body oscillation and enables extended stance and swing phases. The method is validated on a quadruped robot, demonstrating robust locomotion with reduced oscillations, longer stance and swing phases across various terrains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eMPC\u7684\u6b65\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6b65\u4f4d\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u8eab\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u610f\u5916\u7684\u8eab\u4f53\u65cb\u8f6c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6b65\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u6216\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u5012\u7acb\u6446\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u8003\u8651\u7ebf\u901f\u5ea6\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u89d2\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u5b8c\u5168\u7531\u5730\u9762\u53cd\u4f5c\u7528\u529b\uff08GRF\uff09\u5904\u7406\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u79cd\u8003\u8651\u89d2\u901f\u5ea6\u7684MPC\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u6b65\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eMPC\u7684\u6b65\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u8f93\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8c03GRF\u548c\u6b65\u4f4d\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4ec5\u4f18\u5316GRF\u3002\u6b65\u4f4d\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u548cGRF MPC\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e92\u9988\u56de\u8def\uff0c\u76f8\u4e92\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u65b9\u7684\u89e3\u6765\u8fed\u4ee3\u66f4\u65b0\u6b65\u4f4d\u548cGRF\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u8eab\u4f53\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u5e76\u5ef6\u957f\u7ad9\u7acb\u548c\u6446\u52a8\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\u5728\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5730\u5f62\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u632f\u8361\u51cf\u5c0f\uff0c\u7ad9\u7acb\u548c\u6446\u52a8\u9636\u6bb5\u5ef6\u957f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eMPC\u5e76\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u89d2\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u7ebf\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u6b65\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8c03GRF\u548c\u6b65\u4f4d\u6765\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u8eab\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The initial noise of the generation process is typically characterized as a random element that contributes to the diversity of the generated content. Contrary to this view, this paper reveals that beneath the random surface of noise lies strong analyzable patterns. Specifically, this paper first conducts a comprehensive analysis of the impact of random noise on the model's generation. We found that noise not only contains rich semantic information, but also allows for the erasure of unwanted semantics from it in an extremely simple way based on information theory, and using the equivalence between the generation process of diffusion model and semantic injection to inject semantics into the cleaned noise. Then, we mathematically decipher these observations and propose a simple but efficient training-free and universal two-step \"Semantic Erasure-Injection\" process to modulate the initial noise in T2C diffusion model. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is consistently effective across various T2C models based on both DiT and UNet architectures and presents a novel perspective for optimizing the generation of diffusion model, providing a universal tool for consistent generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u521d\u59cb\u566a\u58f0\u4e2d\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u201c\u8bed\u4e49\u64e6\u9664-\u6ce8\u5165\u201d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u5230\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6587\u672c\u5230\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\uff08T2C\uff09\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u65f6\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u521d\u59cb\u566a\u58f0\u4e2d\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u671f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u8c03\u63a7\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u521d\u59cb\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u566a\u58f0\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5305\u542b\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u64e6\u9664\u4e0d\u671f\u671b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u3002\u968f\u540e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u6ce8\u5165\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u6ce8\u5165\u5230\u7ecf\u8fc7\u6e05\u6d17\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u4e2d\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684\u4e24\u6b65\u201c\u8bed\u4e49\u64e6\u9664-\u6ce8\u5165\u201d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6765\u8c03\u63a7\u521d\u59cb\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u57fa\u4e8eDiT\u548cUNet\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u591a\u79cdT2C\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u90fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u666e\u904d\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5373\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u63a7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u566a\u58f0\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u201c\u8bed\u4e49\u64e6\u9664-\u6ce8\u5165\u201d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8eT2C\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

A promising approach for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLM agents is to better utilize prior experiences in guiding current decisions. However, LLMs acquire experience either through implicit memory via training, which suffers from catastrophic forgetting and limited interpretability, or explicit memory via prompting, which lacks adaptability. In this paper, we introduce a novel agent-centric, trainable, multi-layered graph memory framework and evaluate how context memory enhances the ability of LLMs to utilize parametric information. The graph abstracts raw agent trajectories into structured decision paths in a state machine and further distills them into high-level, human-interpretable strategic meta-cognition. In order to make memory adaptable, we propose a reinforcement-based weight optimization procedure that estimates the empirical utility of each meta-cognition based on reward feedback from downstream tasks. These optimized strategies are then dynamically integrated into the LLM agent's training loop through meta-cognitive prompting. Empirically, the learnable graph memory delivers robust generalization, improves LLM agents' strategic reasoning performance, and provides consistent benefits during Reinforcement Learning (RL) training.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u3001\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u56fe\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5229\u7528\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u8f68\u8ff9\u62bd\u8c61\u5316\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u70bc\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u6574\u5408\u5230LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u6218\u7565\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u4efb\u52a1\u65b9\u9762\u6f5c\u529b\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5229\u7528\u5148\u9a8c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u9690\u5f0f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6216\u663e\u5f0f\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\u6216\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5229\u7528\u5148\u9a8c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6765\u6307\u5bfcLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5f53\u524d\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u3001\u4ee5\u4ee3\u7406\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u3001\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u56fe\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u4ee3\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u62bd\u8c61\u5316\u4e3a\u72b6\u6001\u673a\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u70bc\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6218\u7565\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u4f18\u5316\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u53cd\u9988\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u6574\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u5c06\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u52a8\u6001\u96c6\u6210\u5230LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u56fe\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6846\u67b6\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6218\u7565\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u56fe\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u6218\u7565\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

While previous studies have primarily focused on magic in single systems, its interactions and distribution in multipartite settings remain largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce mutual mana as a measure of magic correlations defined in close analogy with quantum mutual information. Our definition builds upon mana, which is the established quantifier of magic based on discrete Wigner function negativity. We characterize magic correlations generated by discrete beamsplitters, whose Gaussian counterparts are fundamental components in quantum optics and quantum technologies. We show that coupling a magic state with a stabilizer vacuum state via a discrete beamsplitter will induce a full conversion of local magic into mutual mana, thereby establishing a mechanism for redistributing magic resources as magic correlations. We reveal the fundamental properties of mutual mana and derive its explicit expressions for several prototypical qutrit states subject to a discrete beamsplitter. We make a comparative study of mutual mana with several established quantifiers of correlations generated by the qutrit beamsplitter, including quantum mutual information, mutual $L^1$-norm magic, and mutual stabilizer 2-R\u00e9nyi entropy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u201c\u9b54\u529b\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u201d\uff08mutual mana\uff09\u8fd9\u4e00\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9b54\u529b\uff08magic\uff09\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u5173\u8054\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u5206\u675f\u5668\u5728\u9b54\u529b\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5355\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9b54\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9b54\u529b\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u201c\u9b54\u529b\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u201d\uff08mutual mana\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8861\u91cf\u9b54\u529b\u5173\u8054\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u7ef4\u683c\u7eb3\u51fd\u6570\u8d1f\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08mana\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u5bfc\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u5206\u675f\u5668\u5728\u751f\u6210\u9b54\u529b\u5173\u8054\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u7279\u5b9aqutrit\u6001\u7ecf\u8fc7\u79bb\u6563\u5206\u675f\u5668\u540e\u7684\u9b54\u529b\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u4e00\u4e2a\u9b54\u6001\u4e0e\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a33\u5b9a\u5668\u771f\u7a7a\u6001\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u6563\u5206\u675f\u5668\u8026\u5408\u65f6\uff0c\u5c40\u57df\u7684\u9b54\u529b\u80fd\u591f\u5b8c\u5168\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9b54\u529b\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9b54\u529b\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u5bf9\u9b54\u529b\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u4e921\u8303\u6570\u9b54\u529b\uff08mutual L1-norm magic\uff09\u3001\u4e92\u7a33\u5b9a2-Renyi\u71b5\uff08mutual stabilizer 2-Renyi entropy\uff09\u7b49\u5173\u8054\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9b54\u529b\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u662f\u8861\u91cf\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9b54\u529b\u8d44\u6e90\u5173\u8054\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u79bb\u6563\u5206\u675f\u5668\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9b54\u529b\u8d44\u6e90\u5728\u5c40\u57df\u6001\u548c\u5173\u8054\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

We present a confidence-aware decoding framework that couples deep ensembles of compact, speech-oriented convolutional networks with post-hoc calibration and selective classification. Uncertainty is quantified using ensemble-based predictive entropy, top-two margin, and mutual information, and decisions are made with an abstain option governed by an accuracy-coverage operating point. The approach is evaluated on a multi-class overt speech dataset using a leakage-safe, block-stratified split that respects temporal contiguity.

However, resolving the three-dimensional (3D) arrangement of these defects in multi-layer 2D materials remains a fundamental challenge, hindering rational defect engineering. Here, we overcome this limitation using an artificial intelligence-guided electron microscopy workflow to map the 3D topology and clustering of atomic vacancies in Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_X$ MXene. Our approach reconstructs the 3D coordinates of vacancies across hundreds of thousands of lattice sites, generating robust statistical insight into their distribution that can be correlated with specific synthesis pathways. This large-scale data enables us to classify a hierarchy of defect structures--from isolated vacancies to nanopores--revealing their preferred formation and interaction mechanisms, as corroborated by molecular dynamics simulations.

This work is part of the Zerovision project. Code available at: https://github.com/ertis-research/zerovision", "summary": "Foam formation in Wastewater Treatment Plants (WTPs) is a major challenge that can reduce treatment efficiency and increase costs. The ability to automatically examine changes in real-time with respect to the percentage of foam can be of great benefit to the plant. However, large amounts of labeled data are required to train standard Machine Learning (ML) models. The development of these systems is slow due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of labeled data. Additionally, the development is often hindered by the fact that different WTPs do not share their data due to privacy concerns. This paper proposes a new framework to address these challenges by combining Federated Learning (FL) with the state-of-the-art base model for image segmentation, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). The FL paradigm enables collaborative model training across multiple WTPs without centralizing sensitive operational data, thereby ensuring privacy. The framework accelerates training convergence and improves segmentation performance even with limited local datasets by leveraging SAM2's strong pre-trained weights for initialization. The methodology involves fine-tuning SAM2 on distributed clients (edge nodes) using the Flower framework, where a central Fog server orchestrates the process by aggregating model weights without accessing private data. The model was trained and validated using various data collections, including real-world images captured at a WTPs in Granada, Spain, a synthetically generated foam dataset, and images from publicly available datasets to improve generalization. This research offers a practical, scalable, and privacy-aware solution for automatic foam tracking in WTPs. The findings highlight the significant potential of integrating large-scale foundational models into FL systems to solve real-world industrial challenges characterized by distributed and sensitive data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FL\uff09\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578bSAM2\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u4e0d\u5171\u4eab\u9690\u79c1\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728\u5e9f\u6c34\u5904\u7406\u5382\uff08WTPs\uff09\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u76d1\u6d4b\u6ce1\u6cab\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e9f\u6c34\u5904\u7406\u5382\uff08WTPs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6ce1\u6cab\u95ee\u9898\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u5904\u7406\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u53d7\u9690\u79c1\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u7f13\u6162\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FL\uff09\u548cSAM2\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7Flower\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\uff08\u8fb9\u7f18\u8282\u70b9\uff09\u4e0a\u5bf9SAM2\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4e2d\u592e\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8d1f\u8d23\u805a\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u8bbf\u95ee\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u6765\u81ea\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u683c\u62c9\u7eb3\u8fbeWTPs\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u5408\u6210\u6ce1\u6cab\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u53ca\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u52a0\u901f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u672c\u5730\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aWTPs\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6ce1\u6cab\u8ffd\u8e2a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u6ce8\u91cd\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5de5\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u548c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u6ce1\u6cab\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In OTFS, the data symbols are mapped to the Doppler-Delay (DD) domain. In this paper, we address bandwidth-efficient estimation of channel state information (CSI) for MIMO OTFS systems. Existing channel estimation techniques either require non-overlapped DD-domain pilots and associated guard regions across multiple antennas, sacrificing significant communication rate as the number of transmit antennas increases, or sophisticated algorithms to handle overlapped pilots, escalating the cost and complexity of receivers. We introduce a novel pilot-aided channel estimation method that enjoys low overhead while achieving high performance. Our approach embeds pilots within each OTFS burst in the Time-Frequency (TF) domain. We propose a novel use of TF and DD guard bins, aiming to preserve waveform orthogonality on the pilot bins and DD data integrity, respectively. The receiver first obtains low-complexity coarse estimates of the channel parameters. Leveraging the orthogonality, a virtual array (VA) is constructed. This enables the formulation of a sparse signal recovery (SSR) problem, in which the coarse estimates are used to build a low-dimensional dictionary matrix. The SSR solution yields high-resolution estimates of channel parameters. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves good performance with only a small number of pilots and guard bins. Furthermore, the required overhead is independent of the number of transmit antennas, ensuring good scalability of the proposed method for large MIMO arrays. The proposed approach considers practical rectangular transmit pulse-shaping and receiver matched filtering, and also accounts for fractional Doppler effects.", "AI": {"tldr": "OTFS\u8c03\u5236\u5728\u9ad8\u901f\u79fb\u52a8\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u3001\u9ad8 \u015dielvde \u7684MIMO OTFS\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff08CSI\uff09\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u65f6\u9891\uff08TF\uff09\u57df\u5d4c\u5165\u5bfc\u9891\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528TF\u548cDD\u4fdd\u62a4\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7c97\u7565\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u865a\u62df\u9635\u5217\uff08VA\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u4fe1\u53f7\u6062\u590d\uff08SSR\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 \u015dielvde \u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e14\u5f00\u9500\u4e0e\u5929\u7ebf\u6570\u91cf\u65e0\u5173\uff0c \u015dielvde \u6269\u5c55\u6027\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MIMO OTFS\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728 \u015dielvde \u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u015dielvde \u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c \u015dielvde \u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728 \u015dielvde \u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u3001\u9ad8 \u015dielvde \u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5bfc\u9891\u8f85\u52a9\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u9891\uff08TF\uff09\u57df\u5d4c\u5165\u5bfc\u9891\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528TF\u548cDD\u4fdd\u62a4\u5355\u5143\u3002\u63a5\u6536\u7aef\u9996\u5148\u83b7\u5f97\u4fe1\u9053\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7c97\u7565\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6784\u5efa\u865a\u62df\u9635\u5217\uff08VA\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u4fe1\u53f7\u6062\u590d\uff08SSR\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7c97\u7565\u4f30\u8ba1\u6784\u5efa\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5b57\u5178\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u5bfc\u9891\u548c\u4fdd\u62a4\u5355\u5143\u5373\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u7684 \u015dielvde\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6240\u9700\u5f00\u9500\u4e0e\u4f20\u8f93\u5929\u7ebf\u6570\u91cf\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86 \u015dielvde \u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5bfc\u9891\u8f85\u52a9\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728MIMO OTFS\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u3001\u9ad8 \u015dielvde \u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684 \u015dielvde \u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u6574\u5f62\u3001\u5339\u914d\u6ee4\u6ce2\u548c\u5206\u6570\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u6548\u5e94\u3002"}}

This paper develops a novel approach that combines tangentbased path planning and extrapolation methods to create a new decision-making algorithm for local path planning. In the assumed scenario, a UGV has a prior knowledge of its initial and target points within the dynamic environment. A global path has already been computed, and the robot is provided with waypoints along this path. As the UGV travels between these waypoints, the algorithm aims to avoid collisions with dynamic obstacles. These obstacles follow polynomial trajectories, with their initial positions randomized in the local map and velocities randomized between O and the allowable physical velocity limit of the robot, along with some random accelerations. The developed algorithm is tested in several scenarios where many dynamic obstacles move randomly in the environment. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed local path planning strategy by gradually generating a collision free path which allows the robot to navigate safely between initial and the target locations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5207\u7ebf\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5916\u63d2\u6cd5\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5c40\u90e8\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u51b3\u7b56\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u969c\u788d\u7269\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5f15\u5bfc\u65e0\u4eba\u5730\u9762\u8f7d\u5177\uff08UGV\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u907f\u969c\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u969c\u788d\u7269\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u3067\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cUGV\u7684\u907f\u969c\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5207\u7ebf\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5916\u63d2\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3aUGV\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u8d77\u70b9\u3001\u7ec8\u70b9\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u8def\u5f84\uff08\u5305\u542b\u822a\u70b9\uff09\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u5c40\u90e8\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89c4\u907f\u6cbf\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u969c\u788d\u7269\u3002\u969c\u788d\u7269\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u5747\u968f\u673a\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u5c40\u90e8\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4f7fUGV\u80fd\u591f\u5b89\u5168\u5730\u5728\u8d77\u70b9\u548c\u7ec8\u70b9\u4e4b\u95f4\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5305\u542b\u5927\u91cf\u968f\u673a\u79fb\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u969c\u788d\u7269\u7684\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u3002"}}

While recent methods have achieved remarkable performance, they often rely heavily on fully annotated datasets, which are costly and labor-intensive to obtain. In real-world scenarios, particularly in multi-label datasets, label noise is prevalent and severely degrades retrieval performance. Moreover, existing CMH approaches typically overlook the partial semantic overlaps inherent in multi-label data, limiting their robustness and generalization. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework named Semantic-Consistent Bidirectional Contrastive Hashing (SCBCH). The framework comprises two complementary modules: (1) Cross-modal Semantic-Consistent Classification (CSCC), which leverages cross-modal semantic consistency to estimate sample reliability and reduce the impact of noisy labels; (2) Bidirectional Soft Contrastive Hashing (BSCH), which dynamically generates soft contrastive sample pairs based on multi-label semantic overlap, enabling adaptive contrastive learning between semantically similar and dissimilar samples across modalities. Extensive experiments on four widely-used cross-modal retrieval benchmarks validate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art approaches under noisy multi-label conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u53cc\u5411\u5bf9\u6bd4\u54c8\u5e0c\uff08SCBCH\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u54c8\u5e0c\uff08CMH\uff09\u4e2d\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u8bed\u4e49\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u54c8\u5e0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u8bed\u4e49\u91cd\u53e0\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "SCBCH\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff1a1. \u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u5206\u7c7b\uff08CSCC\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u6837\u672c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5e76\u51cf\u8f7b\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b2. \u53cc\u5411\u8f6f\u5bf9\u6bd4\u54c8\u5e0c\uff08BSCH\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u8f6f\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eSCBCH\u5728\u5e26\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SCBCH\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u8bed\u4e49\u91cd\u53e0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Yet traditional surveys face persistent challenges, including fixed-question formats, high costs, limited adaptability, and difficulties ensuring cross-cultural equivalence. While recent studies explore large language models (LLMs) to simulate survey responses, most are limited to structured questions, overlook the entire survey process, and risks under-representing marginalized groups due to training data biases. We introduce AlignSurvey, the first benchmark that systematically replicates and evaluates the full social survey pipeline using LLMs. It defines four tasks aligned with key survey stages: social role modeling, semi-structured interview modeling, attitude stance modeling and survey response modeling. It also provides task-specific evaluation metrics to assess alignment fidelity, consistency, and fairness at both individual and group levels, with a focus on demographic diversity. To support AlignSurvey, we construct a multi-tiered dataset architecture: (i) the Social Foundation Corpus, a cross-national resource with 44K+ interview dialogues and 400K+ structured survey records; and (ii) a suite of Entire-Pipeline Survey Datasets, including the expert-annotated AlignSurvey-Expert (ASE) and two nationally representative surveys for cross-cultural evaluation. We release the SurveyLM family, obtained through two-stage fine-tuning of open-source LLMs, and offer reference models for evaluating domain-specific alignment.

Manuscript under review", "summary": "We report the realization of an all-optical, tabletop effective-negative-mass oscillator (ENMO) scheme capable of canceling quantum noise when cascaded with an opto-mechanical sensor susceptible to (quantum) radiation pressure noise. Our coherent quantum noise cancellation (CQNC) scheme offers a broadband cancellation capability with a tunable, wavelength-flexible, and compact system. This is achieved through the implementation of an optical equivalent of an opto-mechanical interaction, facilitated by a down-conversion and a beam-splitting process. The intricate nature of the system and its multiple interacting components made characterizing the interdependent parameters with conventional methods ineffective, leading to the development of an in-situ characterization scheme. The obtained parameters meet the targets for CQNC set in previous studies.

Despite growing interest in brain-computer interface technologies, relatively little attention has been paid to developing EEG-based communication support systems tailored for aphasic patients. To address this gap, we recruited a single participant with expressive aphasia and conducted an Korean-based automatic speech task. EEG signals were recorded during task performance, and each trial was labeled as either correct or incorrect depending on whether the intended word was successfully spoken. Spectral analysis revealed distinct neural activation patterns between the two trial types: misarticulated trials exhibited excessive delta power across widespread channels and increased theta-alpha activity in frontal regions. Building upon these findings, we developed a soft multitask learning framework with maximum mean discrepancy regularization that focus on delta features to jointly optimize class discrimination while aligning the EEG feature distributions of correct and misarticulated trials. The proposed model achieved 58.6 % accuracy for correct and 45.5 % for misarticulated trials-outperforming the baseline by over 45 % on the latter-demonstrating robust intention decoding even under articulation errors. These results highlight the feasibility of EEG-based assistive systems capable of supporting real-world, imperfect speech conditions in aphasia patients.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8111\u7535\u56fe\uff08EEG\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\uff08ASR\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5e2e\u52a9\u5931\u8bed\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u6d41\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790EEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u9891\u6bb5\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u533a\u5206\u6b63\u786e\u53d1\u97f3\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u53d1\u97f3\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u5c1d\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f6f\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5931\u8bed\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6c9f\u901a\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u53d1\u97f3\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u76ee\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eEEG\u7684\u4ea4\u6d41\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u5b9e\u9645\u6c9f\u901a\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u53d1\u97f3\u60c5\u51b5\u7684EEG\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e00\u540d\u5931\u8bed\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u5728\u6267\u884c\u97e9\u8bed\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u7684EEG\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5206\u4e3a\u6b63\u786e\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u53d1\u97f3\u4e24\u7c7b\u3002\u5229\u7528\u9891\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u7c7b\u8bd5\u6b21\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8Delta\u9891\u6bb5\u548cTheta-Alpha\u9891\u6bb5\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f6f\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6700\u5927\u5747\u503c\u5dee\u5f02\uff08MMD\uff09\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5Delta\u7279\u5f81\u4e3a\u91cd\u70b9\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7c7b\u522b\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u6b63\u786e\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u53d1\u97f3\u8bd5\u6b21\u7684EEG\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b63\u786e\u53d1\u97f3\u8bd5\u6b21\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8658.6%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u53d1\u97f3\u8bd5\u6b21\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8645.5%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u53d1\u97f3\u8bd5\u6b21\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8645%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eEEG\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5931\u8bed\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u5b9e\u9645\u6c9f\u901a\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u6761\u4ef6\u65b9\u9762\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u7801\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u610f\u56fe\u3002"}}

Symbolic regression serves as a powerful tool for uncovering mathematical models that describe these relationships. It can automatically generate equations to predict material behaviour under specific manufacturing conditions and optimize performance characteristics such as strength and elasticity.\n  The present work illustrates how symbolic regression can derive constitutive models that describe the behaviour of various metallic alloys during plastic deformation. Constitutive modelling is a mathematical framework for understanding the relationship between stress and strain in materials under different loading conditions. In this study, two materials (age-hardenable aluminium alloy and high-chromium martensitic steel) and two different testing methods (compression and tension) are considered to obtain the required stress-strain data. The results highlight the benefits of using symbolic regression while also discussing potential challenges.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u4ece\u6750\u6599\u53d8\u5f62\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u672c\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5de5\u827a-\u7ed3\u6784-\u6027\u80fd\u5173\u7cfb\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u6750\u6599\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u63cf\u8ff0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u6750\u6599\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6750\u6599\uff08\u65f6\u6548\u786c\u5316\u94dd\u5408\u91d1\u548c\u9ad8\u94ec\u9a6c\u6c0f\u4f53\u94a2\uff09\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u62c9\u4f38\uff09\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u5e94\u529b-\u5e94\u53d8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u6765\u63a8\u5bfc\u63cf\u8ff0\u5851\u6027\u53d8\u5f62\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u672c\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u5728\u4ece\u6750\u6599\u53d8\u5f62\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63a8\u5bfc\u672c\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u9014\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u63cf\u8ff0\u6750\u6599\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u672c\u6784\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u6750\u6599\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Prior work has introduced differential privacy (DP) guarantees for RAG, but only in single-query settings, which fall short of realistic usage. In this paper, we study the more practical multi-query setting and propose two DP-RAG algorithms. The first, MURAG, leverages an individual privacy filter so that the accumulated privacy loss only depends on how frequently each document is retrieved rather than the total number of queries. The second, MURAG-ADA, further improves utility by privately releasing query-specific thresholds, enabling more precise selection of relevant documents.

Using random matrix theory, we show that, in the asymptotic regime, the dominant singular values and vectors of the transmitter-RIS and RIS-receiver channels converge to their deterministic Line-of-Sight (LoS) components, almost irrespective of the Ricean factors. This enables RIS phase configuration using only LoS information through a closed-form Sign Alignment (SA) rule that maximizes the channel gain. Furthermore, when the RIS is asymptotically larger than the transceiver arrays, proper RIS configuration can render the end-to-end MIMO channel in the capacity formula asymptotically diagonal, thereby eliminating inter-stream interference and enabling Over-The-Air (OTA) spatial multiplexing without channel knowledge at the transmitter. Building on this result, a waterfilling-inspired SA algorithm that allocates RIS elements to spatial streams, based on the asymptotic singular values and statistical channel parameters, is proposed. Simulation results validate the theoretical analyses, demonstrating that the proposed schemes achieve performance comparable to conventional Riemannian manifold optimization, but with orders of magnitude lower runtime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u745e\u5229\u8870\u843d\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u75281\u6bd4\u7279\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u9762\uff08RIS\uff09\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u591a\u8f93\u5165\u591a\u8f93\u51fa\uff08MIMO\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u745e\u5229\u8870\u843d\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7814\u7a761\u6bd4\u7279RIS\u8f85\u52a9MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5176\u5728\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u7406\u8bba\u4e0b\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u53d1\u5c04\u7aef-RIS\u548cRIS-\u63a5\u6536\u7aef\u4fe1\u9053\u5728\u6e10\u8fd1\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u548c\u5947\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u8ddd\uff08LoS\uff09\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u7b26\u53f7\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08SA\uff09\u89c4\u5219\u6765\u914d\u7f6eRIS\u76f8\u4f4d\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u6c34\u586b\u5145\u542f\u53d1\u7684SA\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u914dRIS\u5355\u5143\u5230\u7a7a\u95f4\u6d41\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6e10\u8fd1\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\uff0c\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u548c\u5947\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\u6536\u655b\u4e8e\u5176\u89c6\u8ddd\u5206\u91cf\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684SA\u89c4\u5219\u53ef\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4fe1\u9053\u589e\u76ca\u3002\u5f53RIS\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5927\u4e8e\u6536\u53d1\u5668\u9635\u5217\u65f6\uff0cRIS\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u7aef\u5230\u7aefMIMO\u4fe1\u9053\u6e10\u8fd1\u5730\u53d8\u4e3a\u5bf9\u89d2\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u53d1\u5c04\u7aef\u4fe1\u9053\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684OTA\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u7528\u3002\u6c34\u586b\u5145\u542f\u53d1\u5f0fSA\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u9ece\u66fc\u6d41\u5f62\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u957f\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a1\u6bd4\u7279RIS\u8f85\u52a9MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In this work, we continue on the developed system by, firstly, evaluating its performance on recently published marine datasets. Then, we integrate the different blocks of the system on ROS platform where we could test it in real-time on synchronized LiDAR and camera data collected in various marine conditions available in the MIT marine datasets. We present a thorough experimental analysis of the results obtained using two approaches; one that uses sensor fusion between the camera and LiDAR to detect and track the obstacles and the other uses only the LiDAR point cloud for the detection and tracking.

However, encoder features often entangle domain-relevant and category-relevant information, limiting both generalization and rapid adaptation to new domains. To address this issue, we propose a Divide-and-Conquer Decoupled Network (DCDNet). In the training stage, to tackle feature entanglement that impedes cross-domain generalization and rapid adaptation, we propose the Adversarial-Contrastive Feature Decomposition (ACFD) module. It decouples backbone features into category-relevant private and domain-relevant shared representations via contrastive learning and adversarial learning. Then, to mitigate the potential degradation caused by the disentanglement, the Matrix-Guided Dynamic Fusion (MGDF) module adaptively integrates base, shared, and private features under spatial guidance, maintaining structural coherence. In addition, in the fine-tuning stage, to enhanced model generalization, the Cross-Adaptive Modulation (CAM) module is placed before the MGDF, where shared features guide private features via modulation ensuring effective integration of domain-relevant information.

Sometimes this causes situations of civil unrest such as protests, rallies, and marches. These events may be disruptive in nature and are often held without prior permission from the competent authority. Forecasting these events helps administrative officials take necessary action. Usually, protests are announced well in advance to encourage large participation. Therefore, by analyzing such announcements in news articles, planned events can be forecasted beforehand. We developed such a system in this paper to forecast social unrest events using topic modeling and word2vec to filter relevant news articles, and Named Entity Recognition (NER) methods to identify entities such as people, organizations, locations, and dates. Time normalization is applied to convert future date mentions into a standard format. In this paper, we have developed a geographically independent, generalized model to identify key features for filtering civil unrest events.

However, training reliable RMs under limited resources remains challenging due to the reliance on large-scale preference annotations and the high cost of fine-tuning LLMs. To address this, we propose SparseRM, which leverages Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to extract preference-relevant information encoded in model representations, enabling the construction of a lightweight and interpretable reward model. SparseRM first employs SAE to decompose LLM representations into interpretable directions that capture preference-relevant features. The representations are then projected onto these directions to compute alignment scores, which quantify the strength of each preference feature in the representations. A simple reward head aggregates these scores to predict preference scores. Experiments on three preference modeling tasks show that SparseRM achieves superior performance over most mainstream RMs while using less than 1% of trainable parameters. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly into downstream alignment pipelines, highlighting its potential for efficient alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "SparseRM\u5229\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAE\uff09\u4ece\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u504f\u597d\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08RM\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u504f\u597d\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u9ad8\u6602\u7684LLM\u5fae\u8c03\u6210\u672c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e3b\u6d41RM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u4e0d\u52301%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08RM\uff09\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fd9\u9700\u8981\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u504f\u597d\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u9ad8\u6602\u7684LLM\u5fae\u8c03\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "SparseRM\u5229\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAE\uff09\u63d0\u53d6LLM\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u4e0e\u504f\u597d\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002SAE\u5c06LLM\u8868\u793a\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6355\u83b7\u504f\u597d\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u8868\u793a\u88ab\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u4ee5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u9f50\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u504f\u597d\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5934\u805a\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u6570\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u504f\u597d\u5206\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u504f\u597d\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSparseRM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4e3b\u6d41RM\uff0c\u800c\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5374\u4e0d\u52301%\u3002", "conclusion": "SparseRM\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u504f\u597d\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6784\u5efa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5b83\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4e0b\u6e38\u5bf9\u9f50\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684LLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

While 2D ferromagnets have received significant attention with regard to predicting Curie temperatures, the treatment of 2D anti-ferromagnetism has largely been restricted to classical approaches, which typically underestimate N\u00e9el temperatures. The concept of anti-ferromagnetism can be regarded as a special case of single-$Q$ magnetic order, and for such systems the critical temperature can be calculated from the magnon dispersion using either Holstein-Primakoff (HP) bosonization or Green's function-based Random Phase Approximation (RPA). Here, we study the effects of single-ion anisotropy in general single-$Q$ systems in both the HP and RPA methods. In the case of RPA, we generalize the approach to include the Callen Decoupling (CD) correction, which has previously been shown to yield good agreement with experimental Curie temperatures for 2D ferromagnets. We compare the calculated critical temperatures of CrI$_3$ (uniaxial ferromagnet), MPS$_3$ (M=Ni, Mn, Fe) (uniaxial anti-ferromagnets) and CrSBr (triaxial ferromagnet) monolayers with experimental values and find that the Green's function-based methods are much more reliable than HP and that the CD decoupling appears to be more accurate than RPA if the single-ion anisotropy is large.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86 Holstein-Primakoff (HP) \u548c\u5305\u542b Callen Decoupling (CD) \u6821\u6b63\u7684\u968f\u673a\u76f8\u8fd1\u4f3c (RPA) \u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u78c1\u6709\u5e8f\u4e34\u754c\u6e29\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08RPA \u548c CD\uff09\u6bd4 HP \u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5355\u8f74\u79bb\u5b50\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u8f83\u5927\u65f6\u3002", "motivation": "\u78c1\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ef4\u6301\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u957f\u7a0b\u78c1\u6709\u5e8f\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e34\u754c\u6e29\u5ea6\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6848\u4e2d\u5fc5\u987b\u8003\u8651\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u4e8c\u7ef4\u53cd\u94c1\u78c1\u6027\u7684\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u4f4e\u4f30 N\u00e9el \u6e29\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5355\u8f74\u79bb\u5b50\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u5bf9\u5355-Q \u4f53\u7cfb\u5728 HP \u548c RPA \u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5728 RPA \u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5f15\u5165\u4e86 CD \u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86 CrI$_{3}$\u3001MPS$_{3}$ (M=Ni, Mn, Fe) \u548c CrSBr \u5355\u5206\u5b50\u5c42\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e34\u754c\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u503c\u7684\u543b\u5408\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08RPA \u548c CD\uff09\u6bd4 HP \u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4e34\u754c\u6e29\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3002\u5f53\u5355\u8f74\u79bb\u5b50\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u8f83\u5927\u65f6\uff0cCD \u6821\u6b63\u6bd4 RPA \u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5305\u542b\u5355\u8f74\u79bb\u5b50\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4\u78c1\u6027\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5e26\u6709 CD \u6821\u6b63\u7684 RPA\uff09\u6bd4 Holstein-Primakoff \u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u4e34\u754c\u6e29\u5ea6\u3002"}}

The proposed active short circuit and safe discharge mechanisms are also included in this work, dedicated to multi-phase converters in failure conditions. With silicon carbide (SiC) power modules increasingly used in high efficiency and high-power applications, the reliability under fault conditions is an extremely important factor. Cascading failures and permanent damage will occur in multi phase inverter systems if short circuit faults are not prevented. The proposed method combines one centralized short circuit detection, active phase shorting and controlled discharge to make these structures more robust. The on chip active short circuit mechanism isolates the affected phases quickly preventing faults from spreading to other areas of the inverter and the safe discharge mechanism controls energy discharged in fault scenarios, which reduces the thermal stress placed on essential components. The experimental results show that the proposed mechanisms can effectively enhance a fault detection performance, system response during faults, and the operation as whole at faults over the several existing methods. These mechanisms are demonstrated to be very important for enhancing the safety and reliability of multiphase inverters, especially for critical applications of such inverters as EV where high operational security is required.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u76f8\u9006\u53d8\u5668\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff09\u7684\u6709\u6e90\u77ed\u8def\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u653e\u7535\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u5728\u6545\u969c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u76f8\u9006\u53d8\u5668\u5728\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6545\u969c\u4fdd\u62a4\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u968f\u7740\u78b3\u5316\u7845\uff08SiC\uff09\u529f\u7387\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3001\u5927\u529f\u7387\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u6545\u969c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5982\u679c\u4e0d\u52a0\u4ee5\u9884\u9632\uff0c\u77ed\u8def\u6545\u969c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u76f8\u9006\u53d8\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u751f\u7ea7\u8054\u6545\u969c\u548c\u6c38\u4e45\u6027\u635f\u574f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u77ed\u8def\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u6709\u6e90\u76f8\u4f4d\u77ed\u8def\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u653e\u7535\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7247\u4e0a\u96c6\u6210\u6709\u6e90\u77ed\u8def\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u5feb\u901f\u9694\u79bb\u6545\u969c\u76f8\u4f4d\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u6545\u969c\u8513\u5ef6\uff1b\u5b89\u5168\u653e\u7535\u673a\u5236\u5219\u5728\u6545\u969c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u91cf\u91ca\u653e\uff0c\u51cf\u8f7b\u5173\u952e\u5143\u4ef6\u7684\u70ed\u5e94\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u673a\u5236\u5728\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6545\u969c\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u54cd\u5e94\u4ee5\u53ca\u6574\u4f53\u6545\u969c\u8fd0\u884c\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6709\u6e90\u77ed\u8def\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u653e\u7535\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u76f8\u9006\u53d8\u5668\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5bf9\u8fd0\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u8981\u6c42\u6781\u9ad8\u7684\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

The backbone is finetuned for 14 thoracic findings with a sigmoid head, trained using Multilabel Iterative Stratification (MIS) for robust cross-validation splits that preserve label co-occurrence. To address extreme class imbalance and asymmetric error costs, we optimize with Asymmetric Loss, employ mixed-precision (AMP), cosine learning-rate decay with warm-up, gradient clipping, and an exponential moving average (EMA) of weights. We propose a lightweight Label-Graph Refinement module placed after the classifier: given per-label probabilities, it learns a sparse, trainable inter-label coupling matrix that refines logits via a single message-passing step while adding only an L1-regularized parameter head. At inference, we apply horizontal flip test-time augmentation (TTA) and average predictions across MIS folds (a compact deep ensemble). Evaluation uses macro AUC averaging classwise ROC-AUC and skipping single-class labels in a fold to reflect balanced performance across conditions. On our dataset, a strong SE-ResNeXt101 baseline attains competitive macro AUC (e.g., 92.64% in our runs). Adding the Label-Graph Refinement consistently improves validation macro AUC across folds with negligible compute.

We argue that this challenge can be resolved by modeling the distribution of clean samples in the encoder embedding manifold. To this end, we propose the Manifold-Correcting Causal Flow (MC^2F), a two-module system that operates directly on sentence embeddings. A Stratified Riemannian Continuous Normalizing Flow (SR-CNF) learns the density of the clean data manifold. It identifies out-of-distribution embeddings, which are then corrected by a Geodesic Purification Solver. This solver projects adversarial points back onto the learned manifold via the shortest path, restoring a clean, semantically coherent representation. We conducted extensive evaluations on text classification (TC) across three datasets and multiple adversarial attacks. The results demonstrate that our method, MC^2F, not only establishes a new state-of-the-art in adversarial robustness but also fully preserves performance on clean data, even yielding modest gains in accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "MC^2F\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5d4c\u5165\u6d41\u5f62\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5e72\u51c0\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65f6\u635f\u5bb3\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7SR-CNF\u5b66\u4e60\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6d41\u5f62\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u7eaf\u5316\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5c06\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6837\u672c\u6295\u5f71\u56de\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u3002MC^2F\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5d4c\u5165\u6d41\u5f62\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5e72\u51c0\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "MC^2F\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u6a21\u5757\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1a1.  \u0935\u093e\u092a\u0930\u093eSR-CNF\u5b66\u4e60\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u5d4c\u5165\u30022. \u7528\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u7eaf\u5316\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5c06\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u70b9\u6295\u5f71\u56de\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u6062\u590d\u5e72\u51c0\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cMC^2F\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b8c\u5168\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u7565\u6709\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "MC^2F\u6210\u529f\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d41\u5f62\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Fundamental interactions are either extremely short-range or decay inversely with the separation distance, such as the Coulomb potential between charges or the gravitational attraction between masses. In contrast, emergent quantum van der Waals (vdW) and Casimir interactions decay considerably faster ($R^{-6}$ or $R^{-7}$) with distance $R$. Here we apply perturbative quantum electrodynamics (QED) to a many-body (MB) system of atoms modeled as charged harmonic oscillators, and reveal a persistent inverse-distance MB-QED interaction stemming from the coupling between virtual photons and molecular plasmons in the non-retarded regime. This interaction, scaling with the third power of the fine-structure constant, is reminiscent of the Lamb shift for a single atom. Although weaker than vdW forces, this MB-QED $R^{-1}$ interaction may substantially surpass gravitational attraction in future experiments probing quantum gravity at microscopic scales.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u3001\u957f\u7a0b\u7684\uff08\u4e0e\u8ddd\u79bb\u6210\u53cd\u6bd4\uff09\u591a\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff08MB-QED\uff09\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8be5\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6e90\u4e8e\u539f\u5b50\u95f4\u865a\u62df\u5149\u5b50\u4e0e\u5206\u5b50\u7b49\u79bb\u6fc0\u5143\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u672a\u6765\u63a2\u6d4b\u5fae\u89c2\u5c3a\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f15\u529b\u5438\u5f15\u3002", "motivation": "\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u57fa\u672c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff08\u5982\u5e93\u4ed1\u529b\u548c\u5f15\u529b\uff09\u548c\u6d8c\u73b0\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff08\u5982\u8303\u5fb7\u534e\u529b\u548c\u5361\u897f\u7c73\u5c14\u529b\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u3001\u4e0e\u8ddd\u79bb\u6210\u53cd\u6bd4\u7684\u591a\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u539f\u5b50\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5e26\u7535\u8c10\u632f\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u5fae\u6270\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff08QED\uff09\u5230\u591a\u4f53\uff08MB\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff08non-retarded\uff09\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86 MB-QED \u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8be5\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0e\u8ddd\u79bb\u6210\u53cd\u6bd4\uff0c\u5e76\u968f\u7740\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7ed3\u6784\u5e38\u6570\u7684\u7acb\u65b9\u800c\u589e\u957f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fd9\u79cd MB-QED \u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6bd4\u8303\u5fb7\u534e\u529b\u5f31\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u672a\u6765\u63a2\u6d4b\u5fae\u89c2\u5c3a\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5176\u6548\u5e94\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u5927\u4e8e\u5f15\u529b\u5438\u5f15\u3002"}}

In contrast, we would like to understand how data can be explained with deep learning model training and propose a novel approach to understand the data via one of the most common media - language - so that humans can easily understand. Our approach proposes a pipeline to generate textual descriptions that can explain the data with large language models by incorporating external knowledge bases. However, generated data descriptions may still include irrelevant information, so we introduce to exploit influence estimation to choose the most informative textual descriptions, along with the CLIP score. Furthermore, based on the phenomenon of cross-modal transferability, we propose a novel benchmark task named cross-modal transfer classification to examine the effectiveness of our textual descriptions. In the experiment of zero-shot setting, we show that our textual descriptions are more effective than other baseline descriptions, and furthermore, we successfully boost the performance of the model trained only on images across all nine image classification datasets. These results are further supported by evaluation using GPT-4o. Through our approach, we may gain insights into the inherent interpretability of the decision-making process of the model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027AI\uff08XAI\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u6570\u636e\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5a92\u4ecb\uff0c\u4f7f\u4eba\u7c7b\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u7684\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5f71\u54cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u548cCLIP\u5206\u6570\u6765\u7b5b\u9009\u6700\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8fc1\u79fb\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\u63cf\u8ff0\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e5d\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff1bGPT-4o\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e5f\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u4e86\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5185\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While nodal line (NL) and nodal surface (NS) semimetals have been extensively studied, the realization of a material where both NL and NS coexist and are intertwined, particularly with an ideal electronic band structure, remains a significant challenge. Here, we predict via first-principles calculations and symmetry analysis a metastable boron allotrope, Porous-B$_{18}$ (space group $P6_3/m$, No.~176), as a pristine TSM hosting a NS and two straight NLs near the Fermi level. The structure, a honeycomb-like porous 3D framework, exhibits excellent dynamical, thermal (stable up to 1000~K), and mechanical stability. Its electronic band structure is remarkably clean: only the highest valence band (HVB) and the lowest conduction band (LCB) cross linearly within a large energy window of 1.84~eV, free from trivial-band interference. The nodal surface lies on the $k_z = \\pm \u03c0$ planes, protected by combined time-reversal symmetry ($T$) and twofold screw-rotational symmetry ($S_{2z}$), yielding a full-plane Kramers-like degeneracy. The two nodal lines along $K$--$H$ and $K'$--$H'$ are protected by inversion and time-reversal symmetries, carry a quantized Berry phase of $\\pm \u03c0$, and connect orthogonally to the nodal surface, forming an intertwined nodal network. Drumhead surface states on the $(1\\bar{1}0)$ surface further confirm the nontrivial topology. Porous-B$_{18}$ thus provides an ideal platform for investigating the interplay between nodal-line and nodal-surface fermions and exploring novel quantum transport phenomena.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPorous-B$_{18}$\u7684\u4e9a\u7a33\u6001\u787c\u540c\u7d20\u5f02\u5f62\u4f53\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u62d3\u6251\u534a\u91d1\u5c5e(TSM)\uff0c\u5728\u8be5\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd1\u8d39\u7c73\u80fd\u7ea7\u540c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e14\u76f8\u4e92\u4ea4\u7ec7\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u7ebf(NL)\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u9762(NS)\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bfb\u627e\u4e00\u79cd\u540c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8282\u70b9\u7ebf\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u9762\u5e76\u4e14\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u5e26\u7ed3\u6784\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u6750\u6599\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5206\u6790\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u7814\u7a76Porous-B$_{18}$\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "\u9884\u6d4bPorous-B$_{18}$\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u6709NS\u548c\u4e24\u6761\u76f4\u7ebfNL\u7684TSM\uff0c\u5176\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u5e26\u7ed3\u6784\u5e72\u51c0\uff0c\u80fd\u91cf\u7a97\u53e3\u5927\uff0c\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u5e73\u51e1\u5e26\u5e72\u6270\u3002NS\u4f4d\u4e8e$k_z = \bf{\text{\u00b1}}\bf{\text{\u03c0}}$\u5e73\u9762\u4e0a\uff0c\u53d7\u65f6\u95f4\u53cd\u8f6c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027($T$)\u548c\u53cc\u91cd\u87ba\u65cb\u8f6c\u7f6e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027($S_{2z}$)\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u5168\u5e73\u9762\u514b\u83b1\u9ed8\u65af\u6837\u7b80\u5e76\u3002\u4e24\u6761\u6cbf$K$--$H$\u548c$K'$--$H'$\u7684NL\u53d7\u53cd\u6f14\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u53cd\u8f6c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u00b1\u03c0\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u8d1d\u91cc\u76f8\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eNS\u6b63\u4ea4\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4ea4\u7ec7\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u7f51\u7edc\u3002\u9f13\u72b6\u8868\u9762\u6001\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u62d3\u6251\u3002", "conclusion": "Porous-B$_{18}$\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u8282\u70b9\u7ebf\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u9762\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4ee5\u53ca\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u5947\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8f93\u8fd0\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

This reduction enables us to use standard techniques, such as linear programs, to compute and analyze safe policies.

Electrostatic film actuators offer several advantages, including thinness, flexibility, lightweight construction, and high open-loop positioning accuracy. However, the actuation stress exhibited by conventional actuators in air still needs improvement, particularly for the widely used three-phase electrode design. To enhance the output performance of actuators, this paper presents a two-layer electrostatic film actuator with an integrated brake. By alternately distributing electrodes on both the top and bottom layers, a smaller effective electrode pitch is achieved under the same fabrication constraints, resulting in an actuation stress of approximately 241~N/m$^2$, representing a 90.5\\% improvement over previous three-phase actuators operating in air. Furthermore, its integrated electrostatic adhesion mechanism enables load retention under braking mode. Several demonstrations, including a tug-of-war between a conventional single-layer actuator and the proposed two-layer actuator, a payload operation, a one-degree-of-freedom robotic arm, and a dual-mode gripper, were conducted to validate the actuator's advantageous capabilities in both actuation and braking modes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u5c42\u96c6\u6210\u5236\u52a8\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u9759\u7535\u8584\u819c\u6267\u884c\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7535\u6781\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5c06\u9a71\u52a8\u5e94\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u4e8690.5%\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7535\u673a\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b58\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u5927\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u590d\u6742\u3001\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u5236\u52a8\u5668\u7b49\u7f3a\u70b9\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u9759\u7535\u8584\u819c\u6267\u884c\u5668\u867d\u7136\u8f7b\u8584\u3001\u67d4\u6027\u4e14\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9a71\u52a8\u5e94\u529b\u4ecd\u9700\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e09\u76f8\u7535\u6781\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u5c42\u9759\u7535\u8584\u819c\u6267\u884c\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u7535\u6781\u4ea4\u66ff\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u4e24\u5c42\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c0f\u6709\u6548\u7535\u6781\u95f4\u8ddd\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u9759\u7535\u5438\u9644\u5236\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u5236\u9020\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u9a71\u52a8\u5e94\u529b\u8fbe\u5230\u7ea6241 N/m$^2$\uff0c\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u4e09\u76f8\u6267\u884c\u5668\u5728\u7a7a\u6c14\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e8690.5%\u3002\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u9759\u7535\u5438\u9644\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u5728\u5236\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4fdd\u6301\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u5c42\u9759\u7535\u8584\u819c\u6267\u884c\u5668\u5728\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u5236\u52a8\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6f14\u793a\uff08\u5982\u62c9\u952f\u6bd4\u8d5b\u3001\u8d1f\u8f7d\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001\u5355\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u548c\u53cc\u6a21\u5f0f\u5939\u722a\uff09\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To address this, recent work has applied Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to diffusion models, yielding significant improvements.~However, DPO-like methods exhibit two key limitations: 1) High computational cost,due to the entire model fine-tuning; 2) Sensitivity to reference model quality}, due to its tendency to introduce instability and bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework for human preference alignment in diffusion models (PC-Diffusion), using a lightweight, trainable Preference Classifier that directly models the relative preference between samples. By restricting preference learning to this classifier, PC-Diffusion decouples preference alignment from the generative model, eliminating the need for entire model fine-tuning and reference model reliance.~We further provide theoretical guarantees for PC-Diffusion:1) PC-Diffusion ensures that the preference-guided distributions are consistently propagated across timesteps. 2)The training objective of the preference classifier is equivalent to DPO, but does not require a reference model.3) The proposed preference-guided correction can progressively steer generation toward preference-aligned regions.~Empirical results show that PC-Diffusion achieves comparable preference consistency to DPO while significantly reducing training costs and enabling efficient and stable preference-guided generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "PC-Diffusion\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u8be5\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u76f4\u63a5\u6a21\u62df\u6837\u672c\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u504f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08DPO\uff09\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff08\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u6574\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\u548c\u5bf9\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u654f\u611f\uff08\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6216\u504f\u5dee\uff09\u7684\u7f3a\u70b9\u3002", "method": "PC-Diffusion \u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u6837\u672c\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u504f\u597d\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u9650\u5236\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e0a\uff0cPC-Diffusion \u5c06\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5bf9\u6574\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4e5f\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "PC-Diffusion \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e DPO \u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u504f\u597d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\uff0cPC-Diffusion \u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u504f\u597d\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u4e4b\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5176\u504f\u597d\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u7b49\u540c\u4e8e DPO \u4f46\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5f15\u5bfc\u6821\u6b63\u53ef\u4ee5\u9010\u6b65\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u5f15\u5bfc\u5230\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u533a\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "PC-Diffusion \u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709 DPO \u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u5bf9\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u654f\u611f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u4e0e DPO \u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

This work studies the effect of local-gauge-symmetric decoherence on the GHM from the perspective of the subsystem code. We clarify the global phase diagram of the subsystem code. In particular, the decoherence induces an unconventional critical mixed state, where the logical information is preserved but the rest of the system exhibits mixed state criticality. For a fixed point, the decohered subsystem code is understood by the ``gauging out\" prescription. By mapping the GHM to the toric code subject to decoherence, we can understand the properties of the subsystem code. We further discuss and investigate the robustness of the logical space of the subsystem code. Although this kind of subsystem code can be produced by using any bulk mixed state in the GHM, its robustness is a subtle problem due to the mixed critical gauge qubits. We consider some specific unitary for examining the robustness of the stored quantum information. For dynamical unitary perturbations described by interactions between the logical qubit and gauge qubits, the deformation of the subsystem code drastically depends on the initial mixed state of the gauge qubits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u89c4\u8303-\u5e0c\u683c\u65af\u6a21\u578b\uff08GHM\uff09\u89c6\u4e3a\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u89c4\u8303\u5bf9\u79f0\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u5bf9\u5176\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u4e34\u754c\u6df7\u5408\u6001\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u903b\u8f91\u4fe1\u606f\u5f97\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u800c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5176\u4f59\u90e8\u5206\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u6001\u4e34\u754c\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u201c\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u201d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7406\u89e3\u4e86\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7801\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06GHM\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u53d7\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u0442\u043e\u0440ic\u7801\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7801\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u903b\u8f91\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u4ece\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7801\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u89c4\u8303-\u5e0c\u683c\u65af\u6a21\u578b\uff08GHM\uff09\u4e2d\u5c40\u90e8\u89c4\u8303\u5bf9\u79f0\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u7406\u89e3\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u5bf9\u903b\u8f91\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u5b58\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u5c06GHM\u89c6\u4e3a\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5c40\u90e8\u89c4\u8303\u5bf9\u79f0\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6620\u5c04GHM\u5230\u53d7\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u0442\u043e\u0440ic\u7801\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7801\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u903b\u8f91\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u9149\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8\u89c4\u8303\u5bf9\u79f0\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u80fd\u591f\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u6df7\u5408\u6001\uff0c\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\uff0c\u903b\u8f91\u4fe1\u606f\u5f97\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u800c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5176\u4f59\u90e8\u5206\u5219\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u6001\u4e34\u754c\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7801\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u201c\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u201d\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5176\u903b\u8f91\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u521d\u59cb\u6df7\u5408\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06GHM\u4e0e\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7801\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u5e76\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u89c4\u8303\u5bf9\u79f0\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u5bf9\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4fdd\u7559\u903b\u8f91\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u6df7\u5408\u6001\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u7684\u590d\u6742\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

In order to overcome the limitations of existing negative sampling strategies, such as vulnerability to false negatives, limited generalization, and lack of control over sample hardness, we propose DANS-KGC (Diffusion-based Adaptive Negative Sampling for Knowledge Graph Completion). DANS-KGC comprises three key components: the Difficulty Assessment Module (DAM), the Adaptive Negative Sampling Module (ANS), and the Dynamic Training Mechanism (DTM). DAM evaluates the learning difficulty of entities by integrating semantic and structural features. Based on this assessment, ANS employs a conditional diffusion model with difficulty-aware noise scheduling, leveraging semantic and neighborhood information during the denoising phase to generate negative samples of diverse hardness. DTM further enhances learning by dynamically adjusting the hardness distribution of negative samples throughout training, enabling a curriculum-style progression from easy to hard examples.

Among solid electrolytes for solid-state sodium batteries, NASICON-structured Na3Zr2Si2PO12 has emerged as a predominant candidate. However, its widespread implementation remains limited by suboptimal ionic conductivity in both bulk and grain boundary regions. In this study, we demonstrate a novel approach utilizing swirling spray flame synthesis to produce Mg-doped NASICON solid electrolyte nanoparticles. This method facilitates efficient doping and homogeneous mixing for scalable production, resulting in core-shell non-NASICON structures with nano-scale high-entropy mixing. Notably, the atomic migration distances achieved by flame synthesis are significantly reduced compared to conventional solid-state reactions, thereby enabling reactive sintering to preserve high sinterability of nanoparticles during post-treatment processes. High-temperature sintering yields dense NASICON-structured solid electrolytes. Among those, Mg0.25NZSP exhibits an optimal ionic conductivity of 1.91 mS/cm at room temperature and an activation energy of 0.200 eV. The enhancement mechanism can be attributed to incorporation into the NASICON phase and formation of a secondary phase.

Unlike conventional Natural Language Processing (NLP) models that struggle with limitations in semantic interpretability and out-of-vocabulary tokens, our approach operates at the character level with fixed dictionary constraints, enabling scalable processing of large-scale data lakes and warehouses. The CAE architecture encodes text representations of non-semantic relational table columns and extracts high-dimensional feature embeddings for data grouping. By maintaining a fixed dictionary size, our method significantly reduces both memory requirements and training time, enabling efficient processing of large-scale industrial data environments. Experimental evaluation demonstrates substantial performance gains: our CAE approach achieved 80.95% accuracy in top 5 column matching tasks across relational datasets, substantially outperforming traditional NLP approaches such as Bag of Words (47.62%).

The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further aggravates the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across different model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations.

This dependency not only limits scalability and generalization but also restricts adaptability to diverse application scenarios. In this paper, a general-purpose foundation model for SAR land-cover classification is developed, serving as a robust cornerstone to accelerate the development and deployment of various downstream models. Specifically, a Dynamic Instance and Contour Consistency Contrastive Learning (DI3CL) pre-training framework is presented, which incorporates a Dynamic Instance (DI) module and a Contour Consistency (CC) module. DI module enhances global contextual awareness by enforcing local consistency across different views of the same region. CC module leverages shallow feature maps to guide the model to focus on the geometric contours of SAR land-cover objects, thereby improving structural discrimination. Additionally, to enhance robustness and generalization during pre-training, a large-scale and diverse dataset named SARSense, comprising 460,532 SAR images, is constructed to enable the model to capture comprehensive and representative features. To evaluate the generalization capability of our foundation model, we conducted extensive experiments across a variety of SAR land-cover classification tasks, including SAR land-cover mapping, water body detection, and road extraction. The results consistently demonstrate that the proposed DI3CL outperforms existing methods.

Recent advancements using reinforcement learning have already demonstrated the power of this technique when optimizing the circuit for a sequence of non-parameterized gates.

This study investigated the neurophysiological mechanisms of adaptive reasoning using a card-sorting paradigm combined with electroencephalography and compared human performance with that of a multimodal large language model. Stimulus- and feedback-locked analyses revealed coordinated delta-theta-alpha dynamics: early delta-theta activity reflected exploratory monitoring and rule inference, whereas occipital alpha engagement indicated confirmatory stabilization of attention after successful rule identification. In contrast, the multimodal large language model exhibited only short-term feedback-driven adjustments without hierarchical rule abstraction or genuine adaptive reasoning. These findings identify the neural signatures of human adaptive reasoning and highlight the need for brain-inspired artificial intelligence that incorporates oscillatory feedback coordination for true context-sensitive adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8c03\u7684 delta-theta-alpha \u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5219\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fd9\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u751f\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4eba\u7c7b\u80fd\u591f\u7075\u6d3b\u8c03\u6574\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5361\u7247\u5206\u7c7b\u8303\u5f0f\u3001\u8111\u7535\u56fe\uff08EEG\uff09\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u523a\u6fc0\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u8fdb\u884c\u9501\u5b9a\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u534f\u8c03\u7684 delta-theta-alpha \u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\uff1a\u65e9\u671f\u7684 delta-theta \u6d3b\u52a8\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u89c4\u5219\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u800c\u6795\u533a\u7684 alpha \u6d3b\u52a8\u5219\u8868\u660e\u5728\u6210\u529f\u8bc6\u522b\u89c4\u5219\u540e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f97\u5230\u786e\u8ba4\u6027\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u77ed\u671f\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5206\u5c42\u89c4\u5219\u62bd\u8c61\u6216\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u53d7\u5927\u8111\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u3001\u5305\u542b\u632f\u8361\u53cd\u9988\u534f\u8c03\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u3001\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u3002"}}

This results from an inherent risk in road traffic, which arises from multiple sources of complexity and can never be fully eliminated. One central challenge lies in developing a defensible case that the residual risk has been reduced to a reasonable level. While a safety argumentation is a common means to represent this case, there is a need to guide its creation and maintenance by adequate processes. In this paper, we derive requirements for a safety argumentation lifecycle based on examining the current state of the art. In particular, the requirement-driven process design accounts for both identified limitations of current process specifications and implicit knowledge contained in related work. Subsequently, we reflect on interdependencies between the resulting safety argumentation lifecycle and the system lifecycle. Moreover, we discuss a gap in literature regarding transparent ex ante risk communication. Correspondingly, we introduce the concept of representation-supported communication that is based on deriving representations from the argumentation with respect to target stakeholders and communication purposes. Finally, we demonstrate how this approach can be integrated into the system lifecycle to facilitate stakeholder communication.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6c7d\u8f66\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\u5b83\u4eec\u4ecd\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u5730\u4f1a\u53d1\u751f\u4e8b\u6545\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b89\u5168\u8bba\u8bc1\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bba\u8bc1\u7684\u8868\u793a\u652f\u6301\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6c7d\u8f66\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e3a\u8bc1\u660e\u6b8b\u4f59\u98ce\u9669\u5df2\u964d\u4f4e\u5230\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u6c34\u5e73\u800c\u8fdb\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u8bba\u8bc1\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u67e5\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5b89\u5168\u8bba\u8bc1\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6d41\u7a0b\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u9690\u542b\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bba\u8bc1\u7684\u8868\u793a\u652f\u6301\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b89\u5168\u8bba\u8bc1\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u8868\u793a\u652f\u6301\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8be5\u6982\u5ff5\u53ef\u4ee5\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bba\u8bc1\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9a\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u76ee\u7684\u5bfc\u51fa\u8868\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b89\u5168\u8bba\u8bc1\u7684\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002\u8868\u793a\u652f\u6301\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6982\u5ff5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f25\u5408\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8e\u4e8b\u524d\u98ce\u9669\u900f\u660e\u6c9f\u901a\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u6c9f\u901a\u3002"}}

However, traditional radar-based heartbeat sensing methods face performance degradation due to noise. Learning-based radar methods achieve better noise robustness but require costly labeled signals for supervised training. To overcome these limitations, we propose the first unsupervised framework for radar-based heartbeat sensing via Augmented Pseudo-Label and Noise Contrast (Radar-APLANC). We propose to use both the heartbeat range and noise range within the radar range matrix to construct the positive and negative samples, respectively, for improved noise robustness. Our Noise-Contrastive Triplet (NCT) loss only utilizes positive samples, negative samples, and pseudo-label signals generated by the traditional radar method, thereby avoiding dependence on expensive ground-truth physiological signals. We further design a pseudo-label augmentation approach featuring adaptive noise-aware label selection to improve pseudo-label signal quality.

While conventional numerical optimization methods can efficiently handle simple dynamics and cost structures, they often become intractable for the nonlinear or non-differentiable systems commonly encountered in robotics. This article provides a tutorial on probabilistic inference-based MPC, presenting a unified theoretical foundation and a comprehensive overview of representative methods. Probabilistic inference-based MPC approaches, such as Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control, have gained significant attention by reinterpreting optimal control as a problem of probabilistic inference. Rather than relying on gradient-based numerical optimization, these methods estimate optimal control distributions through sampling-based techniques, accommodating arbitrary cost functions and dynamics.

However, a key challenge arises from the inherent mismatch between the discrete token outputs of MLLMs and the continuous nature of quality scores required by IQA tasks. This discrepancy significantly hinders the performance of MLLM-based IQA methods. Previous approaches that convert discrete token predictions into continuous scores often suffer from conversion errors. Moreover, the semantic confusion introduced by level tokens (e.g., ``good'') further constrains the performance of MLLMs on IQA tasks and degrades their original capabilities for related tasks. To tackle these problems, we provide a theoretical analysis of the errors inherent in previous approaches and, motivated by this analysis, propose a simple yet effective framework, Q-Scorer. This framework incorporates a lightweight regression module and IQA-specific score tokens into the MLLM pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Scorer achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple IQA benchmarks, generalizes well to mixed datasets, and further improves when combined with other methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "MLLM\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08IQA\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u79bb\u6563 token \u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u5206\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aQ-Scorer\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8eIQA\u7684\u5206\u6570 token\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2aIQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08IQA\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563 token \u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u5206\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u6240\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7531 level token \u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faQ-Scorer\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728MLLM\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u5757\u548cIQA\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5206\u6570 token\u3002", "result": "Q-Scorer\u5728\u591a\u4e2aIQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e0e\u5176\u5b83\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "Q-Scorer\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MLLM\u5728IQA\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5206\u6570 token \u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Among these, theta-band synchrony has been closely associated with language processing, attentional control, and inner speech. However, previous studies have largely focused on a single mode, such as overt speech, and have rarely conducted an integrated comparison of theta synchrony across different speech modes. In this study, we analyzed differences in theta-band neural synchrony across speech modes based on connectivity metrics, focusing on region-wise variations. The results revealed that overt and whispered speech exhibited broader and stronger frontotemporal synchrony, reflecting active motor-phonological coupling during overt articulation, whereas perceived speech showed dominant posterior and temporal synchrony patterns, consistent with auditory perception and comprehension processes. In contrast, imagined speech demonstrated a more spatially confined but internally coherent synchronization pattern, primarily involving frontal and supplementary motor regions. These findings indicate that the extent and spatial distribution of theta synchrony differ substantially across modes, with overt articulation engaging widespread cortical interactions, whispered speech showing intermediate engagement, and perception relying predominantly on temporoparietal networks. Therefore, this study aims to elucidate the differences in theta-band neural synchrony across various speech modes, thereby uncovering both the shared and distinct neural dynamics underlying language perception and imagined speech.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u542c\u89c9\u3001\u53e3\u8bed\u3001\u8033\u8bed\u3001\u60f3\u8c61\uff09\u7684theta\u795e\u7ecf\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53e3\u8bed\u548c\u8033\u8bed\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u989d\u989e\u53f6\u540c\u6b65\u6027\uff0c\u542c\u89c9\u8bed\u97f3\u5219\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u540e\u90e8\u548c\u989e\u53f6\uff0c\u60f3\u8c61\u8bed\u97f3\u5219\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5c40\u9650\u4f46\u5185\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u53e3\u8bed\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0btheta\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0btheta\u6ce2\u6bb5\u795e\u7ecf\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u5173\u6ce8\u533a\u57df\u95f4\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684theta\u6ce2\u6bb5\u795e\u7ecf\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u533a\u57df\u95f4\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u53e3\u8bed\u548c\u8033\u8bed\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u989d\u989e\u53f6\u540c\u6b65\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u53e3\u8bed\u53d1\u97f3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8-\u8bed\u97f3\u8026\u5408\uff1b\u542c\u89c9\u8bed\u97f3\u5219\u4e3b\u8981\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u540e\u90e8\u548c\u989e\u53f6\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e0e\u542c\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u60f3\u8c61\u8bed\u97f3\u5219\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u66f4\u53d7\u9650\u4f46\u5185\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6d89\u53ca\u989d\u53f6\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u8fd0\u52a8\u533a\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "theta\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53e3\u8bed\u53d1\u97f3\u6d89\u53ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u76ae\u5c42\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u8033\u8bed\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e2d\u7b49\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\uff0c\u800c\u542c\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u989e\u9876\u53f6\u7f51\u7edc\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u9610\u660e\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0btheta\u795e\u7ecf\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63ed\u793a\u8bed\u8a00\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u60f3\u8c61\u8bed\u97f3\u80cc\u540e\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002"}}

However, advances in this field often rely on simplifying assumptions regarding the quantum light's generation and its source. In this work, we relax some of these assumptions and probe the behavior of entangled photon pairs passing through a disordered layer after being generated by a randomly scattered pump via spontaneous parametric down conversion. We experimentally demonstrate that, even when both the pump and the down-converted photons propagate through a dynamic scattering medium, the pairs maintain a sharp peak in their correlations. A comprehensive theoretical and numerical analysis shows that these correlations persist regardless of when the pairs are generated, whether immediately after the pump is scattered or under other conditions. More specifically, we detail how the shape of the angular correlation depends on the pump's scattering and how it varies with the distance between the pair-generation region and the entrance of the disordered medium.

The system integrates a lightweight conditional diffusion encoder and convolutional classifier trained using subject-specific EEG data acquired from a Korean-language paradigm. A dual-criterion early stopping strategy enabled rapid convergence under limited calibration data, while dropout regularization and grouped temporal convolutions ensured stable generalization. During online operation, continuous EEG streams were processed in two-second sliding windows to generate class probabilities that dynamically modulated visual and auditory feedback according to decoding confidence. Across twenty real-time trials, the framework achieved 65% top-1 and 70% top-2 accuracy, outperforming offline evaluation (50% top-1). These results demonstrate the feasibility of deploying diffusion-based EEG decoding under practical clinical constraints, maintaining reliable performance despite environmental variability and minimal preprocessing.

However, effective multi-agent interaction necessitates robust perspective-taking capabilities, enabling models to interpret both physical and epistemic viewpoints. Current training paradigms often neglect these interactive contexts, resulting in challenges when models must reason about the subjectivity of individual perspectives or navigate environments with multiple observers. This study evaluates whether explicitly incorporating diverse points of view using the ReAct framework, an approach that integrates reasoning and acting, can enhance an LLM's ability to understand and ground the demands of other agents. We extend the classic Director task by introducing active visual exploration across a suite of seven scenarios of increasing perspective-taking complexity. These scenarios are designed to challenge the agent's capacity to resolve referential ambiguity based on visual access and interaction, under varying state representations and prompting strategies, including ReAct-style reasoning. Our results demonstrate that explicit perspective cues, combined with active exploration strategies, significantly improve the model's interpretative accuracy and collaborative effectiveness. These findings highlight the potential of integrating active perception with perspective-taking mechanisms in advancing LLMs' application in robotics and multi-agent systems, setting a foundation for future research into adaptive and context-aware AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u6548\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u9700\u8981\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u91c7\u62e9\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528ReAct\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u6574\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u884c\u52a8\uff09\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u540c\u89c2\u70b9\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\u91c7\u62e9\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9\u63a2\u7d22\u6765\u6269\u5c55\u7ecf\u5178\u7684Director\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u5e38\u5e38\u5ffd\u89c6\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9700\u8981\u63a8\u7406\u4e2a\u4f53\u4e3b\u89c2\u89c6\u89d2\u6216\u5728\u6709\u591a\u4e2a\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bfc\u822a\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u91c7\u62e9\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u7ecf\u5178\u7684Director\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u8de8\u4e03\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u573a\u666f\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u91c7\u62e9\u590d\u6742\u6027\u9010\u6e10\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6311\u6218\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6839\u636e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bbf\u95ee\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6307\u4ee3\u6b67\u4e49\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ecReAct\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u7ebf\u7d22\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8LLM\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5176\u4ed6\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9700\u6c42\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u4e3b\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u89c6\u89d2\u91c7\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u63a8\u52a8LLM\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Among them, training-free approaches are gaining attention for their flexibility and generalization over training-based methods. However, they typically struggle with accuracy and efficiency in practical deployment. To address the problems, we propose Sparse3DPR, a novel training-free framework for open-ended scene understanding, which leverages the reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs and requires only sparse-view RGB inputs. Specifically, we introduce a hierarchical plane-enhanced scene graph that supports open vocabulary and adopts dominant planar structures as spatial anchors, which enables clearer reasoning chains and more reliable high-level inferences. Furthermore, we design a task-adaptive subgraph extraction method to filter query-irrelevant information dynamically, reducing contextual noise and improving 3D scene reasoning efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of Sparse3DPR, which achieves a 28.7% EM@1 improvement and a 78.2% speedup compared with ConceptGraphs on the Space3D-Bench.

Nevertheless, tasks derived from work-related contexts inherently reflect real-world complexities, characterized by long-tailed distributions, extreme multi-label target spaces, and scarce data availability. The rise of generalist embedding models prompts the question of their performance in the work domain, especially as progress in the field has focused mainly on individual tasks. To this end, we introduce WorkBench, the first unified evaluation suite spanning six work-related tasks formulated explicitly as ranking problems, establishing a common ground for multi-task progress. Based on this benchmark, we find significant positive cross-task transfer, and use this insight to compose task-specific bipartite graphs from real-world data, synthetically enriched through grounding. This leads to Unified Work Embeddings (UWE), a task-agnostic bi-encoder that exploits our training-data structure with a many-to-many InfoNCE objective, and leverages token-level embeddings with task-agnostic soft late interaction. UWE demonstrates zero-shot ranking performance on unseen target spaces in the work domain, enables low-latency inference by caching the task target space embeddings, and shows significant gains in macro-averaged MAP and RP@10 over generalist embedding models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5de5\u4f5c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u9762\u4e34\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u6781\u7aef\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86WorkBench\u8bc4\u4f30\u5957\u4ef6\u548cUWE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4f5c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u5177\u6709\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u6781\u7aef\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u5de5\u4f5c\u9886\u57df\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86WorkBench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u516d\u4e2a\u5de5\u4f5c\u76f8\u5173\u6392\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u5957\u4ef6\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u589e\u5f3a\u7684 bipartite \u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Unified Work Embeddings (UWE) \u6a21\u578b\u3002UWE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u53cc\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u591a\u5bf9\u591aInfoNCE\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528token\u7ea7\u5d4c\u5165\u548ctask-agnostic soft late interaction\u3002", "result": "UWE\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6392\u540d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u7f13\u5b58\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u7a7a\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cUWE\u5728\u5b8f\u5e73\u5747MAP\u548cRP@10\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "WorkBench\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5de5\u4f5c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1NLP\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u3002UWE\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5de5\u4f5c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684NLP\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Transition operators are compiled into block-encoded circuits and iterated using fixed-point oblivious amplitude amplification, and amplitude-encoded marginals are used to estimate the classical push-forward. Empirically, colour categories such as black and, to a lesser extent, white function as high-degree hubs that dominate probability flow. Consequently, we assess three chain variants: the full network including all colours, a network without black, and a network without black and white, to quantify the effect of hub pruning under realistic circuit depths and measurement budgets. Across networks aggregated from multiple retailers, hub pruning consistently improves quantum and classical agreement at shallow depth; total-variation distance and Kullback-Leibler divergence typically decrease by approximately a factor of two relative to the full network, while state fidelities remain close to unity. A bias-and-contraction analysis explains these gains through reduced cross-terms and an effectively widened spectral gap. The results identify hub-pruned block-encodings as a practical heuristic for near-term experiments on recommendation dynamics using small quantum registers, and they provide a reproducible benchmarking protocol that reports total-variation distance, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and state fidelity as functions of circuit depth and prediction horizon.", "AI": {"tldr":

Yet existing studies on mathematics problem generation have focused on data augmentation for training neural language models rather than on direct educational deployment. To bridge this gap, we define a new task, Isomorphic Math Problem Generation (IMPG), designed to produce structurally consistent variants of source problems. Subsequently, we explored LLM-based frameworks for automatic IMPG through successive refinements, and established Computational Blueprints for Isomorphic Twins (CBIT). With meta-level generation and template-based selective variation, CBIT achieves high mathematical correctness and structural consistency while reducing the cost of generation. Empirical results across refinements demonstrate that CBIT is superior on generation accuracy and cost-effectiveness at scale.

Previous efforts to benchmark the performance of AI models have primarily focused on assessing model performance using group fairness metrics that rely on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC), which does not provide insights into a model's ability to provide accurate estimates. In line with clinical assessments, this paper addresses this gap by incorporating calibration as a complementary benchmarking metric to AUROC-based fairness metrics. Calibration evaluates the alignment between predicted probabilities and observed event rates, offering deeper insights into subgroup biases. We assess the performance of the leading skin cancer detection algorithm of the ISIC 2020 Challenge on the ISIC 2020 Challenge dataset and the PROVE-AI dataset, and compare it with the second and third place models, focusing on subgroups defined by sex, race (Fitzpatrick Skin Tone), and age. Our findings reveal that while existing models enhance discriminative accuracy, they often over-diagnose risk and exhibit calibration issues when applied to new datasets.

Despite their success in open-loop evaluations, these systems often exhibit significant performance degradation in closed-loop scenarios due to causal confusion. This confusion is fundamentally exacerbated by the overreliance of the imitation learning paradigm on expert trajectories, which often contain unattributable noise and interfere with the modeling of causal relationships between environmental contexts and appropriate driving actions.\n  To address this fundamental limitation, we propose Perception-Guided Self-Supervision (PGS) - a simple yet effective training paradigm that leverages perception outputs as the primary supervisory signals, explicitly modeling causal relationships in decision-making. The proposed framework aligns both the inputs and outputs of the decision-making module with perception results, such as lane centerlines and the predicted motions of surrounding agents, by introducing positive and negative self-supervision for the ego trajectory. This alignment is specifically designed to mitigate causal confusion arising from the inherent noise in expert trajectories.\n  Equipped with perception-driven supervision, our method, built on a standard end-to-end architecture, achieves a Driving Score of 78.08 and a mean success rate of 48.64% on the challenging closed-loop Bench2Drive benchmark, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods, including those employing more complex network architectures and inference pipelines. These results underscore the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed PGS framework and point to a promising direction for addressing causal confusion and enhancing real-world generalization in autonomous driving.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5PGS\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u95ed\u73af\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u95ed\u73af\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPGS\uff08Perception-Guided Self-Supervision\uff09\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u611f\u77e5\u8f93\u51fa\u6765\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u5bf9\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6b63\u8d1f\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728Bench2Drive\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8ePGS\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e8678.08\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u5f97\u5206\u548c48.64%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PGS\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u56e0\u679c\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, we investigate synthetic correlated diffusion imaging (CDI$^s$) as an enhancement to standard diffusion-based protocols. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across six state-of-the-art segmentation architectures using 200 patients with co-registered CDI$^s$, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) sequences. We demonstrate that CDI$^s$ integration reliably enhances or preserves segmentation performance in 94% of evaluated configurations, with individual architectures achieving up to 72.5% statistically significant relative improvement over baseline modalities. CDI$^s$ + DWI emerges as the safest enhancement pathway, achieving significant improvements in half of evaluated architectures with zero instances of degradation. Since CDI$^s$ derives from existing DWI acquisitions without requiring additional scan time or architectural modifications, it enables immediate deployment in clinical workflows.

Existing automated systems are typically limited to shallow parsing, failing to extract the actionable intelligence needed for operational decisions. We formalize the complete interpretation task as deep parsing, a dual-reasoning challenge requiring both dynamic knowledge grounding (linking the NOTAM to evolving real-world aeronautical data) and schema-based inference (applying static domain rules to deduce operational status). To tackle this challenge, we propose NOTAM-Evolve, a self-evolving framework that enables a large language model (LLM) to autonomously master complex NOTAM interpretation. Leveraging a knowledge graph-enhanced retrieval module for data grounding, the framework introduces a closed-loop learning process where the LLM progressively improves from its own outputs, minimizing the need for extensive human-annotated reasoning traces. In conjunction with this framework, we introduce a new benchmark dataset of 10,000 expert-annotated NOTAMs. Our experiments demonstrate that NOTAM-Evolve achieves a 30.4% absolute accuracy improvement over the base LLM, establishing a new state of the art on the task of structured NOTAM interpretation.", "AI": {"tldr": "NOTAM-Evolve\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u6765\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u6790\u822a\u7a7a\u5458\u901a\u77e5\uff08NOTAMs\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u9759\u6001\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8630.4%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u624b\u52a8\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5904\u7406NOTAMs\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u6790\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u53d6\u5bf9\u64cd\u4f5c\u51b3\u7b56\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNOTAM-Evolve\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u73af\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8ba9LLM\u4ece\u81ea\u8eab\u8f93\u51fa\u6765\u9010\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u8f85\u4ee5\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b10,000\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684NOTAM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "NOTAM-Evolve\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316NOTAM\u89e3\u91ca\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e8630.4%\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840LLM\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002", "conclusion": "NOTAM-Evolve\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u9759\u6001\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86NOTAM\u7684\u590d\u6742\u89e3\u91ca\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u822a\u7a7a\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5904\u7406\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u91cd\u5927\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

This is especially a concern in vision-based environments where minor manipulations of high-dimensional image inputs can easily mislead the agent's behavior. To this end, various defenses have been proposed recently, with state-of-the-art approaches achieving robust performance even under large state perturbations. However, after closer investigation, we found that the effectiveness of the current defenses is due to a fundamental weakness of the existing $l_p$ norm-constrained attacks, which can barely alter the semantics of image input even under a relatively large perturbation budget. In this work, we propose SHIFT, a novel policy-agnostic diffusion-based state perturbation attack to go beyond this limitation. Our attack is able to generate perturbed states that are semantically different from the true states while remaining realistic and history-aligned to avoid detection. Evaluations show that our attack effectively breaks existing defenses, including the most sophisticated ones, significantly outperforming existing attacks while being more perceptually stealthy. The results highlight the vulnerability of RL agents to semantics-aware adversarial perturbations, indicating the importance of developing more robust policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "RL\u7cfb\u7edf\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u867d\u7136\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u6e90\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709l_p\u8303\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u653b\u51fb\u96be\u4ee5\u6539\u53d8\u56fe\u50cf\u8bed\u4e49\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u6270\u52a8\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5SHIFT\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u72b6\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u540c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e14\u5386\u53f2\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7a81\u7834\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RL\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff09\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u88ab\u4f4e\u4f30\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u7684l_p\u8303\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u9762\u4e0a\u6539\u53d8\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSHIFT\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u7b56\u7565\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u6270\u52a8\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u6709\u6240\u4e0d\u540c\u4f46\u5916\u89c2\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e14\u4e0e\u5386\u53f2\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "result": "SHIFT\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7a81\u7834\u73b0\u6709\u7684RL\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u4e0a\u66f4\u52a0\u9690\u853d\u3002", "conclusion": "RL\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

With the ever-increasing incorporation of these data-driven models into the estimation domain, model predictions with reliable margins of error are a requirement -- especially for safety-critical applications. This paper discusses the application of a novel real-time, data-driven estimation approach based on the multi-fidelity residual physics-informed neural process (MFR-PINP) toward the real-time state estimation of a robotic system. Specifically, we address the model-mismatch issue of selecting an accurate kinematic model by tasking the MFR-PINP to also learn the residuals between simple, low-fidelity predictions and complex, high-fidelity ground-truth dynamics. To account for model uncertainty present in a physical implementation, robust uncertainty guarantees from the split conformal (SC) prediction framework are modeled in the training and inference paradigms. We provide implementation details of our MFR-PINP-based estimator for a hybrid online learning setting to validate our model's usage in real-time applications. Experimental results of our approach's performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art variants of the Kalman filter (i.e. unscented Kalman filter and deep Kalman filter) in estimation scenarios showed promising results for the MFR-PINP model as a viable option in real-time estimation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6b8b\u5dee\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08MFR-PINP\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\uff08SC\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u7b97\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u6709\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\u7684\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eMFR-PINP\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u7b80\u5355\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u771f\u5b9e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528SC\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bf4\u660e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u76ee\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u7684\u65e0\u8ff9\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff08UKF\uff09\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff08DKF\uff09\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cMFR-PINP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f30\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MFR-PINP\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408SC\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u3001\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose a human motion synthesis framework that take an unified Scene Semantic Occupancy (SSO) for scene representation, termed SSOMotion. We design a bi-directional tri-plane decomposition to derive a compact version of the SSO, and scene semantics are mapped to an unified feature space via CLIP encoding and shared linear dimensionality reduction. Such strategy can derive the fine-grained scene semantic structures while significantly reduce redundant computations. We further take these scene hints and movement direction derived from instructions for motion control via frame-wise scene query. Extensive experiments and ablation studies conducted on cluttered scenes using ShapeNet furniture, as well as scanned scenes from PROX and Replica datasets, demonstrate its cutting-edge performance while validating its effectiveness and generalization ability.

With the rise of instruction-tuned decoder-only models, commonly known as large language models (LLMs), the field has increasingly moved toward zero-shot and few-shot prompting. However, the performance of LLMs on text classification, particularly on less-resourced languages, remains under-explored. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of current language models on text classification tasks across several South Slavic languages. We compare openly available fine-tuned BERT-like models with a selection of open-source and closed-source LLMs across three tasks in three domains: sentiment classification in parliamentary speeches, topic classification in news articles and parliamentary speeches, and genre identification in web texts. Our results show that LLMs demonstrate strong zero-shot performance, often matching or surpassing fine-tuned BERT-like models. Moreover, when used in a zero-shot setup, LLMs perform comparably in South Slavic languages and English. However, we also point out key drawbacks of LLMs, including less predictable outputs, significantly slower inference, and higher computational costs.

Extended version with full Appendix", "summary": "Efficient retrieval of external knowledge bases and web pages is crucial for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs. Previous works on training LLMs to leverage external retrievers for solving complex problems have predominantly employed end-to-end reinforcement learning. However, these approaches neglect supervision over the reasoning process, making it difficult to guarantee logical coherence and rigor. To address these limitations, we propose Thinker, a hierarchical thinking model for deep search through multi-turn interaction, making the reasoning process supervisable and verifiable. It decomposes complex problems into independently solvable sub-problems, each dually represented in both natural language and an equivalent logical function to support knowledge base and web searches. Concurrently, dependencies between sub-problems are passed as parameters via these logical functions, enhancing the logical coherence of the problem-solving process. To avoid unnecessary external searches, we perform knowledge boundary determination to check if a sub-problem is within the LLM's intrinsic knowledge, allowing it to answer directly.

However, traditional simulation-based optimization methods have long been plagued by significant limitations: they are typically capable of optimizing only a single problem at a time and require substantial computational time for meshing and numerical simulation. This paper introduces a novel framework leveraging cutting-edge Scientific Machine Learning (Sci-ML) methodologies to overcome these inherent drawbacks of conventional approaches. The proposed method provides instantaneous solutions to a spectrum of complex, multidimensional optimization problems. A micromixer case study is employed to demonstrate this methodology. An agent, operating on a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture, serves as the optimizer to explore the relationships between key problem parameters. This optimizer interacts with an environment constituted by a parametric Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), which responds to the agent's actions at a significantly higher speed than traditional numerical methods. The agent's objective, conditioned on the Schmidt number is to discover the optimal geometric and physical parameters that maximize the micromixer's efficiency. After training the agent across a wide range of Schmidt numbers, we analyzed the resulting optimal designs. Across this entire spectrum, the achieved efficiency was consistently greater than the baseline, normalized value. The maximum efficiency occurred at a Schmidt number of 13.3, demonstrating an improvement of approximately 32%. Finally, a comparative analysis with a Genetic Algorithm was conducted under equivalent conditions to underscore the advantages of the proposed method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff08Sci-ML\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DRL\uff09\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PINN\uff09\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5373\u65f6\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5fae\u6df7\u5408\u5668\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u5316\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6210\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4eff\u771f\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u4e14\u4e00\u6b21\u53ea\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u5355\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8017\u65f6\u8017\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DRL\uff09\u4ee3\u7406\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PINN\uff09\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002DRL\u4ee3\u7406\u63a2\u7d22\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ee5\u627e\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0cPINN\u73af\u5883\u5219\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u54cd\u5e94\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5fae\u6df7\u5408\u5668\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff08\u4ee5\u65bd\u5bc6\u7279\u6570\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u65bd\u5bc6\u7279\u6570\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u503c\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5728\u65bd\u5bc6\u7279\u6570\u4e3a13.3\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7ea632%\u3002\u4e0e\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e5f\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Sci-ML\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5fae\u6df7\u5408\u5668\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, extending these methods to quadruped robots remains challenging due to their distinct and highly dynamic motion patterns. Models that perform well on pedestrian data often experience severe degradation when deployed on legged platforms. To tackle this challenge, we introduce X-IONet, a cross-platform inertial odometry framework that operates solely using a single Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). X-IONet incorporates a rule-based expert selection module to classify motion platforms and route IMU sequences to platform-specific expert networks. The displacement prediction network features a dual-stage attention architecture that jointly models long-range temporal dependencies and inter-axis correlations, enabling accurate motion representation. It outputs both displacement and associated uncertainty, which are further fused through an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for robust state estimation. Extensive experiments on public pedestrian datasets and a self-collected quadruped robot dataset demonstrate that X-IONet achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by 14.3% and Relative Trajectory Error (RTE) by 11.4% on pedestrian data, and by 52.8% and 41.3% on quadruped robot data.

Despite some interesting progress, related work still suffers from imperfect point cloud serialization, insufficient high-level geometric perception, and overfitting of the selective state space model (S6) at the core of Mamba. To this end, we resort to an SSM-based point cloud network termed CloudMamba to address the above challenges. Specifically, we propose sequence expanding and sequence merging, where the former serializes points along each axis separately and the latter serves to fuse the corresponding higher-order features causally inferred from different sequences, enabling unordered point sets to adapt more stably to the causal nature of Mamba without parameters.

Advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven significant progress in unified structural QA frameworks like TrustUQA.

To improve the structured data QA ability of small-scale LLMs, we propose a self-correction distillation (SCD) method. In SCD, an error prompt mechanism (EPM) is designed to detect errors and provide customized error messages during inference, and a two-stage distillation strategy is designed to transfer large-scale LLMs' query-generation and error-correction capabilities to small-scale LLM. Experiments across 5 benchmarks with 3 structured data types demonstrate that our SCD achieves the best performance and superior generalization on small-scale LLM (8B) compared to other distillation methods, and closely approaches the performance of GPT4 on some datasets.

Here we extend the EF formalism to incorporate the case of a system under the action of an electromagnetic field. An important interplay between the physical magnetic and the Berry-curvature fields is revealed and discussed within the fully non-adiabatic theory. In particular, it is a known property of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation that, for a neutral atom in a uniform magnetic field, the latter is compensated by the Berry-curvature field in the nuclear equation of motion (\\citet{Yin-92}).

A major challenge lies in modeling the intrinsic stochasticity of temporal dynamics, as real-world sequences often exhibit random fluctuations and localized variations. While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, their generation process is computationally inefficient, often requiring hundreds to thousands of expensive function evaluations per sample. Flow matching has emerged as a more efficient paradigm, yet its conventional ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based formulation fails to explicitly capture stochasticity, thereby limiting the fidelity of generated sequences. By contrast, stochastic differential equation (SDE) are naturally suited for modeling randomness and uncertainty. Motivated by these insights, we propose TimeFlow, a novel SDE-based flow matching framework that integrates a encoder-only architecture.

Our method begins by dividing the service area into zones that group regions with similar temporal patterns of vehicle presence and service demand, allowing the application of discrete optimization methods. In the next stage, we propose a fast ranking-based algorithm that makes its decisions on the basis of the number of cars available in each zone, the projected probability density of demand, and estimated trip durations. The experiments were carried out on the basis of real-world data originating from a major car-sharing service operator in Poland. The results of this algorithm are evaluated against scenarios without optimization that constitute a baseline and compared with the results of an exact algorithm to solve the Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model. As performance metrics, the total travel time was used. Under identical conditions (number of vehicles, staff, and demand distribution), the average improvements with respect to the baseline of our algorithm and MIP solver were equal to 8.44\\% and 19.6\\% correspondingly. However, it should be noted that the MIP model also mimicked decisions on trip selection, which are excluded by current services business rules. The analysis of results suggests that, depending on the size of the workforce, the application of the proposed solution allows for improving performance metrics by roughly 3%-10%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u5171\u4eab\u6c7d\u8f66\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u8f66\u8f86\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u57df\u5212\u5206\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u8f66\u8f86\u548c\u4eba\u5458\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u7531\u6f02\u6d6e\u6c7d\u8f66\u5171\u4eab\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8f66\u8f86\u548c\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u670d\u52a1\u533a\u57df\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u8f66\u8f86\u5b58\u5728\u548c\u9700\u6c42\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u6839\u636e\u533a\u57df\u5185\u53ef\u7528\u8f66\u8f86\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u9700\u6c42\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u884c\u7a0b\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u6765\u505a\u51fa\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u89c4\u5212\uff08MIP\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4e0e\u6ca1\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e868.44%\u548c19.6%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u5728\u8003\u8651\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5c06\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea63%-10%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u4e1a\u52a1\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u5171\u4eab\u6c7d\u8f66\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u3002MIP\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u6539\u8fdb\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f46\u5305\u542b\u4e86\u8d85\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u4e1a\u52a1\u89c4\u5219\u7684 trip selection \u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

Each body part is controlled by a phase variable capable of forward and backward evolution, with a phase coverage reward to promote the exploration of the leg phase space. Additionally, morphological symmetry of the robot is incorporated via data augmentation, improving sample efficiency and enforcing both motion-level and task-level symmetry in learned behaviors.

These constraints cause a lack of geometric cues and reduced accuracy in occluded or truncated scenes. While recent approaches incorporate additional depth information to address geometric ambiguity, they overlook the visual cues crucial for robust recognition. We propose MonoCLUE, which enhances monocular 3D detection by leveraging both local clustering and generalized scene memory of visual features. First, we perform K-means clustering on visual features to capture distinct object-level appearance parts (e.g., bonnet, car roof), improving detection of partially visible objects. The clustered features are propagated across regions to capture objects with similar appearances. Second, we construct a generalized scene memory by aggregating clustered features across images, providing consistent representations that generalize across scenes. This improves object-level feature consistency, enabling stable detection across varying environments. Lastly, we integrate both local cluster features and generalized scene memory into object queries, guiding attention toward informative regions. Exploiting a unified local clustering and generalized scene memory strategy, MonoCLUE enables robust monocular 3D detection under occlusion and limited visibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Existing methods either use one shared parameterized module across all roles or assign a separate parameterized module to each role. However, the role-shared module may ignore distinct traits of each role, weakening personality learning, while the role-specific module may overlook shared traits across multiple roles, hindering commonality modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel HyCoRA: Hyper-Contrastive Role-Adaptive learning framework, which efficiently improves multi-character role-playing ability by balancing the learning of distinct and shared traits. Specifically, we propose a Hyper-Half Low-Rank Adaptation structure, where one half is a role-specific module generated by a lightweight hyper-network, and the other half is a trainable role-shared module. The role-specific module is devised to represent distinct persona signatures, while the role-shared module serves to capture common traits.

A natural generalization of this property is to consider whether a notion of maximal entanglement is possible among all states with the same spectrum (where the aforementioned case of pure states corresponds to the particular choice in which the spectrum is a delta distribution, i.e., rank-1 states). Despite positive evidence in the past that such a notion might exist at least in the case of two-qubit states, it was recently shown in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 050202 (2024)] that the answer to the above question is negative. This reference proved this for particular choices of the spectrum in the case of rank-2 two-qubit density matrices. While this settles the problem in general, it still leaves open whether there are other choices of the spectrum outside the case of pure states where a maximally entangled state for a fixed spectrum might exist.

Addressing these challenges, we introduce VersAtile and Risk-Sensitive cardiac diagnosis (VARS), an innovative approach that employs a graph-based representation to uniformly model heterogeneous ECG signals. VARS stands out by transforming ECG signals into versatile graph structures that capture critical diagnostic features, irrespective of signal diversity in the lead count, sampling frequency, and duration. This graph-centric formulation also enhances diagnostic sensitivity, enabling precise localization and identification of abnormal ECG patterns that often elude standard analysis methods. To facilitate representation transformation, our approach integrates denoising reconstruction with contrastive learning to preserve raw ECG information while highlighting pathognomonic patterns. We rigorously evaluate the efficacy of VARS on three distinct ECG datasets, encompassing a range of structural variations. The results demonstrate that VARS not only consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art models across all these datasets but also exhibits substantial improvement in identifying risk signals. Additionally, VARS offers interpretability by pinpointing the exact waveforms that lead to specific model outputs, thereby assisting clinicians in making informed decisions.

The key question is how to estimate the temporal distance between pairs of observations. While temporal difference methods leverage local updates to provide optimality guarantees, they often perform worse than Monte Carlo methods that perform global updates (e.g., with multi-step returns), which lack such guarantees. We show how these approaches can be integrated into a practical GCRL method that fits a quasimetric distance using a multistep Monte-Carlo return. We show our method outperforms existing GCRL methods on long-horizon simulated tasks with up to 4000 steps, even with visual observations. We also demonstrate that our method can enable stitching in the real-world robotic manipulation domain (Bridge setup).

However, these models are often restricted by a ``single-task-single-model'' paradigm, severely limiting their generalizability and scalability in multi-task scenarios. Motivated by the cross-domain generalization ability of large language models, we propose a universal visual perception framework based on flow matching that can generate diverse visual representations across multiple tasks. Our approach formulates the process as a universal flow-matching problem from image patch tokens to task-specific representations rather than an independent generation or regression problem. By leveraging a strong self-supervised foundation model as the anchor and introducing a multi-scale, circular task embedding mechanism, our method learns a universal velocity field to bridge the gap between heterogeneous tasks, supporting efficient and flexible representation transfer. Extensive experiments on classification, detection, segmentation, depth estimation, and image-text retrieval demonstrate that our model achieves competitive performance in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, outperforming prior generalist and several specialist models. Ablation studies further validate the robustness, scalability, and generalization of our framework.

BARD10 is a curated corpus of Bangla blog and opinion prose from ten contemporary authors, alongside the methodical assessment of four representative classifiers: SVM (Support Vector Machine), Bangla BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), XGBoost, and a MLP (Multilayer Perception), utilizing uniform preprocessing on both BARD10 and the benchmark corpora BAAD16 (Bangla Authorship Attribution Dataset of 16 authors). In all datasets, the classical TF-IDF + SVM baseline outperformed, attaining a macro-F1 score of 0.997 on BAAD16 and 0.921 on BARD10, while Bangla BERT lagged by as much as five points. This study reveals that BARD10 authors are highly sensitive to stop-word pruning, while BAAD16 authors remain comparatively robust highlighting genre-dependent reliance on stop-word signatures. Error analysis revealed that high frequency components transmit authorial signatures that are diminished or reduced by transformer models. Three insights are identified: Bangla stop-words serve as essential stylistic indicators; finely calibrated ML models prove effective within short-text limitations; and BARD10 connects formal literature with contemporary web dialogue, offering a reproducible benchmark for future long-context or domain-adapted transformers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86 Bangla \u4f5c\u8005\u5f52\u5c5e\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684 BARD10 \u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u505c\u7528\u8bcd\u79fb\u9664\u5bf9\u7ecf\u5178\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76 Bangla \u4f5c\u8005\u5f52\u5c5e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u505c\u7528\u8bcd\u5728\u4f5c\u8005\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86 BARD10 \u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528 SVM\u3001Bangla BERT\u3001XGBoost \u548c MLP \u56db\u79cd\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u505c\u7528\u8bcd\u79fb\u9664\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728 BARD10 \u548c BAAD16 \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cTF-IDF + SVM \u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002Bangla BERT \u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5dee\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0 BARD10 \u4f5c\u8005\u5bf9\u505c\u7528\u8bcd\u7684\u79fb\u9664\u66f4\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u800c BAAD16 \u4f5c\u8005\u5219\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u3002\u9ad8\u9891\u8bcd\u5305\u542b\u4f5c\u8005\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u88ab Transformer \u6a21\u578b\u524a\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "Bangla \u505c\u7528\u8bcd\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u6307\u793a\u7b26\uff1b\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4ed4\u7ec6\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77ed\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u6548\uff1bBARD10 \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fde\u63a5\u4e86\u6b63\u5f0f\u6587\u5b66\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

We investigate this phenomenon by benchmarking eight classical optimizers spanning gradient-based, gradient-free, and metaheuristic methods on quantum chemistry Hamiltonians H$_2$, H$_4$ chain, LiH (in both full and active spaces) using the truncated Variational Hamiltonian Ansatz. We analyze difficulties of gradient-based methods (e.g., SLSQP, BFGS) in noisy regimes, where they diverge or stagnate. We show that the bias of estimator can be corrected by tracking the \\textit{population mean}, rather than the biased best individual when using population based optimizer. Our findings, which are shown to generalize to hardware-efficient circuits and condensed matter models, identify adaptive metaheuristics (specifically CMA-ES and iL-SHADE) as the most effective and resilient strategies.

To address this limitation, we propose a fine-grained counterfactual explanation framework that generates both object-level and part-level interpretability, addressing two fundamental questions: (1) which fine-grained features contribute to model misclassification, and (2) where dominant local features influence counterfactual adjustments. Our approach yields explainable counterfactuals in a non-generative manner by quantifying similarity and weighting component contributions within regions of interest between correctly classified and misclassified samples. Furthermore, we introduce a saliency partition module grounded in Shapley value contributions, isolating features with region-specific relevance.

Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a fundamental method for formally verifying safety and generating safe controllers. However, computing the HJ value function that characterizes the backward reachable set (BRS) of a set of user-defined failure states is computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional systems, motivating the use of reinforcement learning approaches to approximate the value function. Unfortunately, a learned value function and its corresponding safe policy are not guaranteed to be correct. The learned value function evaluated at a given state may not be equal to the actual safety return achieved by following the learned safe policy. To address this challenge, we introduce a conformal prediction-based (CP) framework that bounds such uncertainty. We leverage CP to provide probabilistic safety guarantees when using learned HJ value functions and policies to prevent control systems from reaching failure states. Specifically, we use CP to calibrate the switching between the unsafe nominal controller and the learned HJ-based safe policy and to derive safety guarantees under this switched policy. We also investigate using an ensemble of independently trained HJ value functions as a safety filter and compare this ensemble approach to using individual value functions alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\uff08CP\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97 Hamilton-Jacobi\uff08HJ\uff09\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u7387\u6027\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u8fdb\u884c\u6b63\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8ba1\u7b97 HJ \u503c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\uff08CP\uff09\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u6807\u79f0\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684 HJ \u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5728\u6b64\u5207\u6362\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684 HJ \u503c\u51fd\u6570\u96c6\u6210\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd CP \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684 HJ \u503c\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6982\u7387\u6027\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u591f\u6821\u51c6\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e CP \u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684 HJ \u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

However, current intent inference methods often ignore subtle motion that can be strong indicators for a sudden change in intent. Specifically, we aim to tackle 1) if we can detect sudden jumps in operator trajectories, 2) how we appropriately use these sudden jump motions to infer an operator's goal state, and 3) how to incorporate these discontinuous and continuous dynamics to infer operator motion. Our framework, called Psychic, models these small indicative motions through a jump-drift-diffusion stochastic differential equation to cover discontinuous and continuous dynamics. Kramers-Moyal (KM) coefficients allow us to detect jumps with a trajectory which we pair with a statistical outlier detection algorithm to nominate goal transitions. Through identifying jumps, we can perform early detection of existing goals and discover undefined goals in unstructured scenarios. Our framework then applies a Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) model using KM coefficients with the goal transitions as a control input to infer an operator's motion behavior in unstructured scenarios. We demonstrate Psychic can produce probabilistic reachability sets and compare our strategy to a negative log-likelihood model fit.

Recent studies control sketch features at stroke-level by editing values of stroke embeddings as conditions. However, in order to provide generator a global view about what a sketch is going to be drawn, all these edited conditions should be collected and fed into generator simultaneously before generation starts, i.e., no further manipulation is allowed during sketch generating process. In order to realize sketch drawing manipulation more flexibly, we propose a hierarchical auto-regressive sketch generating process. Instead of generating an entire sketch at once, each stroke in a sketch is generated in a three-staged hierarchy: 1) predicting a stroke embedding to represent which stroke is going to be drawn, and 2) anchoring the predicted stroke on the canvas, and 3) translating the embedding to a sequence of drawing actions to form the full sketch. Moreover, the stroke prediction, anchoring and translation are proceeded auto-regressively, i.e., both the recently generated strokes and their positions are considered to predict the current one, guiding model to produce an appropriate stroke at a suitable position to benefit the full sketch generation. It is flexible to manipulate stroke-level sketch drawing at any time during generation by adjusting the exposed editable stroke embeddings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8349\u56fe\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u7b14\u753b\u7ea7\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8349\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u6240\u6709\u7f16\u8f91\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u64cd\u63a7\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u5c42\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u8349\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a1. \u9884\u6d4b\u7b14\u753b\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b2. \u786e\u5b9a\u7b14\u753b\u5728\u753b\u5e03\u4e0a\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff1b3. \u5c06\u5d4c\u5165\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7ed8\u5236\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5730\u8003\u8651\u6700\u8fd1\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7b14\u753b\u53ca\u5176\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u5f53\u524d\u7b14\u753b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u7b14\u753b\u7ea7\u64cd\u63a7\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u7075\u6d3b\u5730\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8c03\u6574\u7b14\u753b\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u8349\u56fe\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u64cd\u63a7\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5408\u9002\u7684\u8349\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5c42\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8349\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u64cd\u63a7\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u9700\u8981\u8c03\u6574\u7b14\u753b\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u8349\u56fe\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

Drawing on corpora of science fiction (Gollancz SF Masterworks) and general fiction (NovelTM), we operationalise Darko Suvin's theory of estrangement as computationally measurable deviation in token prediction, using RoBERTa to generate lexical substitutes for masked referents and classifying them via Gemini. We quantify conceptual slippage through three metrics: retention rate, replacement rate, and entropy, mapping the stability or disruption of category boundaries across genres. Our findings reveal that science fiction exhibits heightened conceptual permeability, particularly around machine referents, which show significant cross-category substitution and dispersion. Human terms, by contrast, maintain semantic coherence and often anchor substitutional hierarchies. These patterns suggest a genre-specific restructuring within anthropocentric logics. We argue that estrangement in science fiction operates as a controlled perturbation of semantic norms, detectable through probabilistic modelling, and that MLMs, when used critically, serve as interpretive instruments capable of surfacing genre-conditioned ontological assumptions.

Integers are encoded on the vertices of a cycle graph, and a quantum walker evolves for a fixed number of steps before its position is measured and recorded. The walker is then reset to the measured site, and the procedure is iterated to produce the sequence of random numbers. We show that when the quantum walk parameters, such as the coin operator and initial state, satisfy the conditions of the ergodic theorem for random walks on finite groups, the resulting sequence converges asymptotically to the uniform distribution. Although correlations between successive outcomes are unavoidable, they can be significantly reduced by a suitable choice of the evolution time. By analyzing the iterated convolution of the quantum walk transition probability and exploiting the ergodic theorem, we demonstrate convergence of the marginal distributions toward the uniform distribution in the asymptotic limit.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cf\u5b50\u884c\u8d70\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u4e4e\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u5916\u90e8\u968f\u673a\u6e90\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u91cf\u5b50\u884c\u8d70\u4ece\u51e0\u4e4e\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u91c7\u6837\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5468\u671f\u56fe\u4e0a\u7f16\u7801\u6574\u6570\uff0c\u8ba9\u91cf\u5b50\u884c\u8d70\u8005\u79fb\u52a8\u56fa\u5b9a\u6b65\u6570\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6d4b\u91cf\u5e76\u8bb0\u5f55\u5176\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u5c06\u884c\u8d70\u8005\u91cd\u7f6e\u5230\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f4d\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b64\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u968f\u673a\u6570\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u91cf\u5b50\u884c\u8d70\u53c2\u6570\u6ee1\u8db3\u6709\u9650\u7fa4\u4e0a\u968f\u673a\u884c\u8d70\u904d\u5386\u5b9a\u7406\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u65f6\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u6e10\u8fd1\u5730\u6536\u655b\u4e8e\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8fde\u7eed\u8f93\u51fa\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u6765\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd9\u79cd\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u91cf\u5b50\u884c\u8d70\u8f6c\u79fb\u6982\u7387\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u5377\u79ef\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u904d\u5386\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fb9\u9645\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u6e10\u8fd1\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u6536\u655b\u4e8e\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u3002"}}

However, existing legal benchmarks often conflate factual recall with genuine inference, fragment the reasoning process, and overlook the quality of reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce MSLR, the first Chinese multi-step legal reasoning dataset grounded in real-world judicial decision making. MSLR adopts the IRAC framework (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) to model structured expert reasoning from official legal documents. In addition, we design a scalable Human-LLM collaborative annotation pipeline that efficiently produces fine-grained step-level reasoning annotations and provides a reusable methodological framework for multi-step reasoning datasets. Evaluation of multiple LLMs on MSLR shows only moderate performance, highlighting the challenges of adapting to complex legal reasoning. Further experiments demonstrate that Self-Initiated Chain-of-Thought prompts generated by models autonomously improve reasoning coherence and quality, outperforming human-designed prompts. MSLR contributes to advancing LLM reasoning and Chain-of-Thought strategies and offers open resources for future research.

We address this gap with a decision-focused continual learning framework that adapts online to a stream of scheduling tasks.

Existing unsupervised RLVR methods, including pure entropy minimization, can overfit to incorrect labels and limit the crucial reward ranking signal for Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). To address these challenges and enhance noise tolerance, we propose a novel two-stage, token-level entropy optimization method for RLVR. This approach dynamically guides the model from exploration to exploitation during training. In the initial exploration phase, token-level entropy maximization promotes diverse and stochastic output generation, serving as a strong regularizer that prevents premature convergence to noisy labels and ensures sufficient intra-group variation, which enables more reliable reward gradient estimation in GRPO. As training progresses, the method transitions into the exploitation phase, where token-level entropy minimization encourages the model to produce confident and deterministic outputs, thereby consolidating acquired knowledge and refining prediction accuracy. Empirically, across three MLLM backbones - Qwen2-VL-2B, Qwen2-VL-7B, and Qwen2.5-VL-3B - spanning diverse noise settings and multiple tasks, our phased strategy consistently outperforms prior approaches by unifying and enhancing external, internal, and entropy-based methods, delivering robust and superior performance across the board.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Here, we propose a tactile-encoded BCI that leverages sensory afferents through a novel tactile-evoked P300 paradigm, allowing intuitive and reliable decoding of supernumerary motor intentions even when superimposed with voluntary actions. The interface was evaluated in a multi-day experiment comprising of a single motor recognition task to validate baseline BCI performance and a dual task paradigm to assess the potential influence between the BCI and natural human movement. The brain interface achieved real-time and reliable decoding of four supernumerary degrees of freedom, with significant performance improvements after only three days of training. Importantly, after training, performance did not differ significantly between the single- and dual-BCI task conditions, and natural movement remained unimpaired during concurrent supernumerary control. Lastly, the interface was deployed in a movement augmentation task, demonstrating its ability to command two supernumerary robotic arms for functional assistance during bimanual tasks.

To analyze any image, it has to be converted to a simple binary image. This binarization process requires the knowledge of polarity of text in the images. Text polarity is defined as the contrast of text with respect to background. That means, text is darker than the background (dark text on bright background) or vice-versa. The binarization process uses this polarity information to convert the original colour or gray scale image into a binary image. In the literature, there is an intuitive approach based on power-law transformation on the original images. In this approach, the authors have illustrated an interesting phenomenon from the histogram statistics of the transformed images. Considering text and background as two classes, they have observed that maximum between-class variance between two classes is increasing (decreasing) for dark (bright) text on bright (dark) background.

As neural networks acquire increasingly complex skills during their pretraining, it is not clear how successfully they can compose them. In this paper, we focus on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), and study their ability to compose skills across modalities. To this end, we design three evaluation tasks which can be solved sequentially composing two modality-dependent skills, and evaluate several open MLLMs under two main settings: i) prompting the model to directly solve the task, and ii) using a two-step cascaded inference approach, which manually enforces the composition of the two skills for a given task. Even with these straightforward compositions, we find that all evaluated MLLMs exhibit a significant cross-modality skill composition gap. To mitigate the aforementioned gap, we explore two alternatives: i) use chain-of-thought prompting to explicitly instruct MLLMs for skill composition and ii) a specific fine-tuning recipe to promote skill composition. Although those strategies improve model performance, they still exhibit significant skill composition gaps, suggesting that more research is needed to improve cross-modal skill composition in MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6280\u80fd\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u5148\u524d\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u53ef\u5e8f\u5217\u7ec4\u5408\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u6001\u76f8\u5173\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u51e0\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90MLLM\uff1a\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u6b65\u7ea7\u8054\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f3a\u5236\u7ec4\u5408\u6280\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u88ab\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684MLLM\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6280\u80fd\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u91c7\u7528\u7ea7\u8054\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e5f\u662f\u5982\u6b64\u3002\u867d\u7136\u901a\u8fc7\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u8003\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u7ec4\u5408\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76ee\u524d\u7684MLLM\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6280\u80fd\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u8fd9\u4e00\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

The problem is complex due to the intricate spatial and temporal interdependence among regions. Prior works study the spatial and temporal dependency in a decouple manner, failing to capture their joint effect. In this work, we propose ST-SAM, a novel and efficient Spatial-Temporal Self-Attention Model for traffic forecasting. ST-SAM uses a region embedding layer to learn time-specific embedding from traffic data for regions. Then, it employs a spatial-temporal dependency learning module based on self-attention mechanism to capture the joint spatial-temporal dependency for both nearby and faraway regions. ST-SAM entirely relies on self-attention to capture both local and global spatial-temporal correlations, which make it effective and efficient. Extensive experiments on two real world datasets show that ST-SAM is substantially more accurate and efficient than the state-of-the-art approaches (with an average improvement of up to 15% on RMSE, 17% on MAPE, and 32 times on training time in our experiments).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51faST-SAM\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u4ea4\u901a\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ea4\u901a\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u533a\u57df\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u89e3\u8026\u5904\u7406\u7684\u3002", "method": "ST-SAM\u6a21\u578b\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u533a\u57df\u5d4c\u5165\u5c42\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u533a\u57df\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cST-SAM\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747RMSE\u548cMAPE\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8615%\u548c17%\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u77ed\u4e8632\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "ST-SAM\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4ea4\u901a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The current theory for schedule-free only supports a constant learning rate, where-as the implementation used in practice uses a warm-up schedule. We show how to extend the last-iterate convergence theory of schedule-free to allow for any scheduler, and how the averaging parameter has to be updated as a function of the learning rate. We then perform experiments showing how our convergence theory has some predictive power with regards to practical executions on deep neural networks, despite that this theory relies on assuming convexity. When applied to the warmup-stable-decay (wsd) schedule, our theory shows the optimal convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$. We then use convexity to design a new adaptive Polyak learning rate schedule for schedule-free. We prove an optimal anytime last-iterate convergence for our new Polyak schedule, and show that it performs well compared to a number of baselines on a black-box model distillation task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u6052\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u7684\u65e0\u8ba1\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u9884\u70ed\u8ba1\u5212\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u65e0\u8ba1\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u8fed\u4ee3\u6536\u655b\u7406\u8bba\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u4f55\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5e73\u5747\u53c2\u6570\u5982\u4f55\u66f4\u65b0\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u51f8\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6267\u884c\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u5f53\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u70ed\u7a33\u5b9a\u8870\u51cf\uff08wsd\uff09\u8c03\u5ea6\u65f6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8868\u660e\u6700\u4f18\u6536\u655b\u7387\u4e3a O(1/\u221aT)\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5229\u7528\u51f8\u6027\u4e3a\u65e0\u8ba1\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94 Polya \u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u7ec8\u8fed\u4ee3\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u84b8\u998f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u8ba1\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u6052\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u9884\u70ed\u8ba1\u5212\u3002\u9700\u8981\u6269\u5c55\u7406\u8bba\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u65e0\u8ba1\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u8fed\u4ee3\u6536\u655b\u7406\u8bba\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u4f55\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u5e73\u5747\u53c2\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u7684\u51fd\u6570\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94 Polya \u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u6700\u4f18\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u7ec8\u8fed\u4ee3\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6267\u884c\u60c5\u51b5\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e wsd \u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8868\u660e\u6700\u4f18\u6536\u655b\u7387\u4e3a O(1/\u221aT)\uff1b\u65b0\u7684 Polya \u8c03\u5ea6\u5728\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u84b8\u998f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u6210\u529f\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u65e0\u8ba1\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6536\u655b\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u9884\u70ed\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94 Polya \u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002"}}

This work presents a coordinated model-based resection planner and learning-based retraction network that work together to enable semi-autonomous tissue resection using a dual-arm transurethral concentric tube robot (the Virtuoso). The resection planner operates directly on segmented CT volumes of prostate phantoms, automatically generating tool trajectories for a three-phase median lobe resection workflow: left/median trough resection, right/median trough resection, and median blunt dissection. The retraction network, PushCVAE, trained on surgeon demonstrations, generates retractions according to the procedural phase. The procedure is executed under Level-3 (supervised) autonomy on a prostate phantom composed of hydrogel materials that replicate the mechanical and cutting properties of tissue. As a feasibility study, we demonstrate that our combined autonomous system achieves a 97.1% resection of the targeted volume of the median lobe. Our study establishes a foundation for image-guided autonomy in transurethral robotic surgery and represents a first step toward fully automated minimally-invasive prostate enucleation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5207\u9664\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u56de\u7f29\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53cc\u81c2\u7ecf\u5c3f\u9053\u540c\u8f74\u7ba1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff08Virtuoso\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u534a\u81ea\u4e3b\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5207\u9664\u3002", "motivation": "\u540c\u8f74\u7ba1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff08CTRs\uff09\u5728\u5fae\u521b\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u4e3b\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5207\u9664\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u534a\u81ea\u4e3b\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5207\u9664\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u8fdb\u7ecf\u5c3f\u9053\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u672f\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5207\u9664\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u56de\u7f29\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PushCVAE\uff09\u3002\u5207\u9664\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5272\u7684CT\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5de5\u5177\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u524d\u5217\u817a\u4e2d\u53f6\u5207\u9664\u3002PushCVAE\u7f51\u7edc\u6839\u636e\u624b\u672f\u9636\u6bb5\u751f\u6210\u56de\u7f29\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u8be5\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5916\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u6f14\u793a\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u524d\u5217\u817a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u6c34\u51dd\u80f6\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6c34\u51dd\u80f6\u524d\u5217\u817a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u4e2d\u53f6\u4f53\u79ef\u768497.1%\u7684\u5207\u9664\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u7ecf\u5c3f\u9053\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u56fe\u50cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u5fae\u521b\u524d\u5217\u817a\u525c\u9664\u672f\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{AquaOV255}, the first large-scale and fine-grained underwater segmentation dataset containing 255 categories and over 20K images, covering diverse categories for open-vocabulary (OV) evaluation. Furthermore, we establish the first underwater OV segmentation benchmark, \\textbf{UOVSBench}, by integrating AquaOV255 with five additional underwater datasets to enable comprehensive evaluation. Alongside, we present \\textbf{Earth2Ocean}, a training-free OV segmentation framework that transfers terrestrial vision--language models (VLMs) to underwater domains without any additional underwater training. Earth2Ocean consists of two core components: a Geometric-guided Visual Mask Generator (\\textbf{GMG}) that refines visual features via self-similarity geometric priors for local structure perception, and a Category-visual Semantic Alignment (\\textbf{CSA}) module that enhances text embeddings through multimodal large language model reasoning and scene-aware template construction.

However, given that quantification interfaces with the logic, pragmatic, and numerical domains, the exact reasons for the poor performance are still unclear. This papers looks at three key features of human quantification shared cross-linguistically that have remained so far unexplored in the (M)LLM literature: the ordering of quantifiers into scales, the ranges of use and prototypicality, and the biases inherent in the human approximate number system. The aim is to determine how these features are encoded in the models' architecture, how they may differ from humans, and whether the results are affected by the type of model and language under investigation. We find that there are clear differences between humans and MLLMs with respect to these features across various tasks that tap into the representation of quantification in vivo vs. in silico. This work, thus, paves the way for addressing the nature of MLLMs as semantic and pragmatic agents, while the cross-linguistic lens can elucidate whether their abilities are robust and stable across different languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "MLLMs\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u73b0\u8c61\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6392\u5e8f\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u539f\u578b\u504f\u89c1\u7b49\u4eba\u7c7b\u5171\u6709\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u5728MLLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0MLLMs\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5316\u662f\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u88ab\uff08\u591a\u6a21\u6001\uff09\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5176\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u786e\u5207\u539f\u56e0\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u91cf\u5316\u6d89\u53ca\u903b\u8f91\u3001\u8bed\u7528\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u4f46\u6b64\u524d\u672a\u88abMLLM\u6587\u732e\u63a2\u7d22\u8fc7\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5171\u6709\u7279\u5f81\uff1a\u91cf\u5316\u8bcd\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6392\u5e8f\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u539f\u578b\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6570\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u786e\u5b9a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6709\u4f55\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7c7b\u578b\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30MLLMs\u4e2d\u91cf\u5316\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cMLLMs\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5728\u4f53\u5916\uff08in silico\uff09\u8fd8\u662f\u4f53\u5185\uff08in vivo\uff09\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a2\u7a76MLLMs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u8bed\u7528\u4e3b\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u9610\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

This \"black box\" nature hinders their adoption in high-stakes operational settings. In this work, we probe the physical consistency of Aurora's encoder by investigating whether its latent representations align with known physical and meteorological concepts. Using a large-scale dataset of embeddings, we train linear classifiers to identify three distinct concepts: the fundamental land-sea boundary, high-impact extreme temperature events, and atmospheric instability. Our findings provide quantitative evidence that Aurora learns physically consistent features, while also highlighting its limitations in capturing the rarest events.

Existing SSC methods have shown efficacy in improving 3D scene representations, but suffer from the inherent input-output dimension gap and annotation-reality density gap, where the 2D planner view from input images with sparse annotated labels leads to inferior prediction of real-world dense occupancy with a 3D stereoscopic view. In light of this, we propose the corresponding High-Dimension High-Density Semantic Scene Completion (HD$^2$-SSC) framework with expanded pixel semantics and refined voxel occupancies. To bridge the dimension gap, a High-dimension Semantic Decoupling module is designed to expand 2D image features along a pseudo third dimension, decoupling coarse pixel semantics from occlusions, and then identify focal regions with fine semantics to enrich image features. To mitigate the density gap, a High-density Occupancy Refinement module is devised with a \"detect-and-refine\" architecture to leverage contextual geometric and semantic structures for enhanced semantic density with the completion of missing voxels and correction of erroneous ones. Extensive experiments and analyses on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 datasets validate the effectiveness of our HD$^2$-SSC framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aHD^2-SSC\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u573a\u666f\u8865\u5168\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u76f8\u673a3D\u8bed\u4e49\u573a\u666f\u8865\u5168\u6240\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u73b0\u5b9e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u8bed\u4e49\u573a\u666f\u8865\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63d0\u53473D\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u9762\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u73b0\u5b9e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f42D\u89c4\u5212\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6807\u6ce8\u6807\u7b7e\u5728\u9884\u6d4b3D\u7acb\u4f53\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5bc6\u96c6\u5360\u7528\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0a\u8ff0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86HD^2-SSC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u8026\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5360\u7528\u7ec6\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u3002\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u8026\u6a21\u5757\u65e8\u5728\u6269\u5c552D\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f2a\u7b2c\u4e09\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c06\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u50cf\u7d20\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u906e\u6321\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u7126\u70b9\u533a\u57df\u4ee5\u4e30\u5bcc\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5360\u7528\u7ec6\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u91c7\u7528\u201c\u68c0\u6d4b-\u7ec6\u5316\u201d\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u4e49\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b8c\u6210\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u4f53\u7d20\u5e76\u7ea0\u6b63\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u4f53\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u5728SemanticKITTI\u548cSSCBench-KITTI-360\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86HD^2-SSC\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HD^2-SSC\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u50cf\u7d20\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u7ec6\u5316\u4f53\u7d20\u5360\u7528\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863D\u8bed\u4e49\u573a\u666f\u8865\u5168\u4e2d\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

By operating in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, quantum circuits enable exponential speed-ups and provide access to richer representations of cost landscapes compared to purely classical methods. These capabilities are particularly relevant for machine learning, where state-of-the-art models especially in Natural Language Processing (NLP) suffer from prohibitive time complexity due to massive matrix multiplications and high-dimensional optimization.\n  In this manuscript, we propose a Hybrid Quantum Classical selection mechanism for the Mamba architecture, designed specifically for temporal sequence classification problems. Our approach leverages Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) as quantum gating modules that both enhance feature extraction and improve suppression of irrelevant information. This integration directly addresses the computational bottlenecks of deep learning architectures by exploiting quantum resources for more efficient representation learning.\n  We analyze how introducing quantum subroutines into large language models (LLMs) impacts their generalization capability, expressivity, and parameter efficiency. The results highlight the potential of quantum-enhanced gating mechanisms as a path toward scalable, resource-efficient NLP models, in a limited simulation step. Within the first four epochs on a reshaped MNIST dataset with input format (batch, 784, d_model), our hybrid model achieved 24.6% accuracy while using one quantum layer and achieve higher expressivity, compared to 21.6% obtained by a purely classical selection mechanism. we state No founding", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u7ecf\u5178\uff08HQC\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u503c\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u9886\u57df\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\uff08VQC\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8\u63a7\u6a21\u5757\u96c6\u6210\u5230Mamba\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u7ecf\u5178\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\uff08NLP\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u7740\u7531\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4f18\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u9ad8\u6602\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\uff08VQC\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8\u63a7\u6a21\u5757\u96c6\u6210\u5230Mamba\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u65e0\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u91cd\u5851\u540e\u7684MNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u8f93\u5165\u683c\u5f0f\u4e3a(batch, 784, d_model)\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5e26\u6709\u91cf\u5b50\u5c42\u548c\u7eaf\u7ecf\u5178\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6b65\u6570\u5185\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u91cd\u5851\u540e\u7684MNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u5c42\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u56db\u4e2a\u5468\u671f\u5185\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8624.6%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u7eaf\u7ecf\u5178\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a21.6%\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u7ecf\u5178\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u6210\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u7684NLP\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

While manually crafting CQs can be highly time-consuming and costly for ontology engineers, recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate this process. However, prior approaches have largely evaluated generated CQs based on their similarity to existing datasets, which often fail to verify semantic pitfalls such as \"Misusing allValuesFrom\". Since such pitfalls cannot be reliably detected through rule-based methods, we propose a novel dataset and model of Validating Semantic Pitfalls in Ontology (VSPO) for CQ generation specifically designed to verify the semantic pitfalls. To simulate missing and misused axioms, we use LLMs to generate natural language definitions of classes and properties and introduce misalignments between the definitions and the ontology by removing axioms or altering logical operators (e.g., substituting union with intersection). We then fine-tune LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to generate CQs that validate these semantic discrepancies between the provided definitions and the corresponding axioms. The resulting CQs can detect a broader range of modeling errors compared to existing public datasets. Our fine-tuned model demonstrates superior performance over baselines, showing 26% higher precision and 28.2% higher recall than GPT-4.1 in generating CQs for pitfall validation.

While recent rectified flow approaches have advanced visuomotor policy learning, they suffer from a key limitation: After iterative distillation, generated actions may deviate from the ground-truth actions corresponding to the current visual observation, leading to accumulated error as the reflow process repeats and unstable task execution. We present Selective Flow Alignment (SeFA), an efficient and accurate visuomotor policy learning framework. SeFA resolves this challenge by a selective flow alignment strategy, which leverages expert demonstrations to selectively correct generated actions and restore consistency with observations, while preserving multimodality. This design introduces a consistency correction mechanism that ensures generated actions remain observation-aligned without sacrificing the efficiency of one-step flow inference. Extensive experiments across both simulated and real-world manipulation tasks show that SeFA Policy surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and flow-based policies, achieving superior accuracy and robustness while reducing inference latency by over 98%. By unifying rectified flow efficiency with observation-consistent action generation, SeFA provides a scalable and dependable solution for real-time visuomotor policy learning.

The terrain depth has a significant impact on the calculated path safety. The craters and hills on the surface cannot be distinguished in a two-dimensional image. The proposed method uses a disparity map of the terrain that is generated by using a UAV. Several computer vision techniques, including edge, line and corner detection methods, as well as the stereo depth reconstruction technique, are applied to the captured images and the found disparity map is used to define candidate way-points of the trajectory. The initial and desired points are detected automatically using ArUco marker pose estimation and circle detection techniques. After presenting the mathematical model and vision techniques, the developed algorithm is compared with well-known algorithms on different virtual scenes created in the V-REP simulation program and a physical setup created in a laboratory environment.

It is an open question whether this architectural bias leads to degraded performance for languages that are structurally different from English. We examine one specific architectural choice: positional encodings, through the lens of the trade-off hypothesis: the supposed interplay between morphological complexity and word order flexibility. This hypothesis posits a trade-off between the two: a more morphologically complex language can have a more flexible word order, and vice-versa. Positional encodings are a direct target to investigate the implications of this hypothesis in relation to language modelling. We pretrain monolingual model variants with absolute, relative, and no positional encodings for seven typologically diverse languages and evaluate them on four downstream tasks.

Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems, for example, depend only on pairwise information -- expectations and correlations between binary variables -- yet standard quantum circuits explore exponentially large state spaces. We recast qubit-efficient optimization as a geometry problem: the minimal representation should match the $O(N^2)$ structure of quadratic objectives. The key insight is that the local-consistency problem -- ensuring that pairwise marginals correspond to a realizable global distribution -- coincides exactly with the Sherali-Adams level-2 polytope $\\mathrm{SA}(2)$, the tightest convex relaxation expressible at the two-body level. Previous qubit-efficient approaches enforced this consistency only implicitly. Here we make it explicit: (a) anchoring learning to the $\\mathrm{SA}(2)$ geometry, (b) projecting via a differentiable iterative-proportional-fitting (IPF) step, and (c) decoding through a maximum-entropy Gibbs sampler. This yields a logarithmic-width pipeline ($2\\lceil\\log_2 N\\rceil + 2$ qubits) that is classically simulable yet achieves strong empirical performance. On Gset Max-Cut instances (N=800--2000), depth-2--3 circuits reach near-optimal ratios ($r^* \\approx 0.99$), surpassing direct $\\mathrm{SA}(2)$ baselines. The framework resolves the local-consistency gap by giving it a concrete convex geometry and a minimal differentiable projection, establishing a clean polyhedral baseline. Extending beyond $\\mathrm{SA}(2)$ naturally leads to spectrahedral geometries, where curvature encodes global coherence and genuine quantum structure becomes necessary.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06QUBO\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u8868\u793a\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8868\u793a\u548c\u6c42\u89e3QUBO\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u63a2\u7d22\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u589e\u957f\u7684\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u5339\u914d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c06QUBO\u95ee\u9898\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u51e0\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528Sherali-Adams level-2\u591a\u9762\u4f53\uff08SA(2)\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fde\u63a5\u5c40\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6865\u6881\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u951a\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u5230SA(2)\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u6bd4\u4f8b\u62df\u5408\uff08IPF\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u71b5Gibbs\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bf9\u6570\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728Gset Max-Cut\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff08N=800--2000\uff09\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e3a2-3\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6bd4\u7387\uff08r* \u2248 0.99\uff09\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u7684SA(2)\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u5730\u901a\u8fc7\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u51f8\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6295\u5f71\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u6269\u5c55\u5230SA(2)\u4ee5\u5916\u7684\u8c31\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u66f2\u7387\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u548c\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

However, existing studies on the expressive power of GNNs mainly focuses on simple single-relation graphs, and there is still insufficient discussion on the power of GNN to express logical rules in KGs. How to enhance the logical expressive power of GNNs is still a key issue. Motivated by this, we propose Path-Neighbor enhanced GNN (PN-GNN), a method to enhance the logical expressive power of GNN by aggregating node-neighbor embeddings on the reasoning path. First, we analyze the logical expressive power of existing GNN-based methods and point out the shortcomings of the expressive power of these methods. Then, we theoretically investigate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN, showing that it not only has strictly stronger expressive power than C-GNN but also that its $(k+1)$-hop logical expressiveness is strictly superior to that of $k$-hop.

This creates a compelling need for multi-objective bilevel learning (MOBL). So far, however, the field of MOBL remains in its infancy and many important problems remain under-explored. This motivates us to fill this gap and systematically investigate the theoretical and algorithmic foundation of MOBL. Specifically, we consider MOBL problems with multiple conflicting objectives guided by preferences at the upper-level subproblem, where part of the inputs depend on the optimal solution of the lower-level subproblem. Our goal is to develop efficient MOBL optimization algorithms to (1) identify a preference-guided Pareto-stationary solution with low oracle complexity; and (2) enable systematic Pareto front exploration. To this end, we propose a unifying algorithmic framework called weighted-Chebyshev multi-hyper-gradient-descent (WC-MHGD) for both deterministic and stochastic settings with finite-time Pareto-stationarity convergence rate guarantees, which not only implies low oracle complexity but also induces systematic Pareto front exploration.

Federated learning (FL), as a decentralized learning framework that trains a shared model with multiple hospitals (a.k.a., FL clients), provides a feasible solution. However, data heterogeneity and resource costs hinder the deployment of FL models, especially when using vision language models (VLM). To address these challenges, we propose a novel contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) based FL approach for medical image classification (FedMedCLIP). Specifically, we introduce a masked feature adaptation module (FAM) as a communication module to reduce the communication load while freezing the CLIP encoders to reduce the computational overhead. Furthermore, we propose a masked multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as a private local classifier to adapt to the client tasks. Moreover, we design an adaptive Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based distillation regularization method to enable mutual learning between FAM and MLP. Finally, we incorporate model compression to transmit the FAM parameters while using ensemble predictions for classification. Extensive experiments on four publicly available medical datasets demonstrate that our model provides feasible performance (e.g., 8\\% higher compared to second best baseline on ISIC2019) with reasonable resource cost (e.g., 120$\\times$ faster than FedAVG).", "AI": {"tldr": "FedMedCLIP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eCLIP\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u533b\u7597\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6210\u672c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u63a9\u7801\u7279\u5f81\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6a21\u5757\uff08FAM\uff09\u548c\u63a9\u7801MLP\u4f5c\u4e3a\u672c\u5730\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408KL\u6563\u5ea6\u84b8\u998f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u7597\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u4ee5\u53ca\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FL\uff09\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u6210\u672c\u963b\u788d\u4e86FL\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bVLM\uff09\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eCLIP\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08FedMedCLIP\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1. \u63a9\u7801\u7279\u5f81\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6a21\u5757\uff08FAM\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u4fe1\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u8d1f\u62c5\u5e76\u51bb\u7ed3CLIP\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u30022. \u63a9\u7801\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\uff08MLP\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u79c1\u6709\u672c\u5730\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4efb\u52a1\u30023. \u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94KL\u6563\u5ea6\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0FAM\u548cMLP\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u5b66\u4e60\u30024. \u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u7528\u4e8e\u4f20\u8f93FAM\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cFedMedCLIP\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5408\u7406\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u6210\u672c\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u6bd4FedAVG\u5feb120\u500d\uff09\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5728ISIC2019\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6bd4\u6b21\u4f18\u57fa\u7ebf\u9ad88%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "FedMedCLIP\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u533b\u7597\u5f71\u50cf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, recent research reveals that LLMs still exhibit performance gaps in Document-level Relation Extraction (DocRE) as requiring fine-grained comprehension. The commonly adopted \"extract entities then predict relations\" paradigm in LLM-based methods leads to these gaps due to two main reasons: (1) Numerous unrelated entity pairs introduce noise and interfere with the relation prediction for truly related entity pairs. (2) Although LLMs have identified semantic associations between entities, relation labels beyond the predefined set are still treated as prediction errors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Relation as a Prior (RelPrior) paradigm for LLM-based DocRE. For challenge (1), RelPrior utilizes binary relation as a prior to extract and determine whether two entities are correlated, thereby filtering out irrelevant entity pairs and reducing prediction noise. For challenge (2), RelPrior utilizes predefined relation as a prior to match entities for triples extraction instead of directly predicting relation. Thus, it avoids misjudgment caused by strict predefined relation labeling.

TNs are particularly suitable for one-dimensional local Hamiltonians, while their performance for generic geometries is mainly limited by two aspects: the limitation in expressive power and the approximate extraction of information. Here we investigate the performance of superposition-of-product-states (SPS) ansatz, a variational framework structurally related to canonical polyadic tensor decomposition. The ansatz does not compress information as effectively as tensor networks, but it has the advantages (i) of allowing accurate extraction of information, (ii) of being structurally independent of the geometry of the system, (iii) of being readily parallelizable, and (iv) of allowing analytical shortcuts. We first study the typical properties of the SPS ansatz for spin-$1/2$ systems, including its entanglement entropy, and its trainability. We then use this ansatz for ground state search in tilted Ising models--including one-dimensional and three-dimensional with short- and long-range interaction, and a random network--demonstrating that SPS can attain high accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08TN\uff09\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e00\u7ef4\u5c40\u90e8\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u901a\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0e\u6b63\u5219\u591a\u7ef4\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u6846\u67b6\u2014\u2014\u79ef\u6001\u53e0\u52a0\uff08SPS\uff09ansatz\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08TN\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u79ef\u6001\u53e0\u52a0\uff08SPS\uff09ansatz\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u514b\u670dTN\u5728\u901a\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76SPS ansatz\u7684\u5178\u578b\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5176\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u548c\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u503e\u659c\u4f0a\u8f9b\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u7ef4\u3001\u4e09\u7ef4\u4ee5\u53ca\u5177\u6709\u77ed\u7a0b\u548c\u957f\u7a0b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u968f\u673a\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u7684\u57fa\u6001\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "SPS ansatz\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u6613\u4e8e\u5e76\u884c\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5141\u8bb8\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u6790\u63a8\u5bfc\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u503e\u659c\u4f0a\u8f9b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86SPS\u80fd\u591f\u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "SPS ansatz\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u901a\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u65e0\u5173\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u3002"}}

We introduce Murphy, a multi-turn reflective optimization framework that extends GRPO by incorporating iterative self-correction during training. By leveraging both quantitative and qualitative execution feedback, Murphy enables models to progressively refine their reasoning across multiple turns. Evaluations on code generation benchmarks with model families such as Qwen and OLMo show that Murphy consistently improves performance, achieving up to a 8% relative gain in pass@1 over GRPO, on similar compute budgets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Murphy\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u8f6e\u53cd\u601d\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u6765\u6269\u5c55GRPO\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684RLVR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982GRPO\uff09\u5728\u9700\u8981\u8fed\u4ee3\u51b3\u7b56\u7684agentic\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u800cMurphy\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "Murphy\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u8f6e\u53cd\u601d\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u8d28\u6027\u6267\u884c\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdbGRPO\u3002", "result": "Murphy\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8eGRPO\uff0c\u5c06Qwen\u548cOLMo\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684pass@1\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e868%\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u76f8\u4f3c\u3002", "conclusion": "Murphy\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6e\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347LLMs\u5728\u9700\u8981\u8fed\u4ee3\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

As a representative task for addressing this challenge, layout-to-image generation aims to generate images that are spatially consistent with the given layout condition. Existing layout-to-image methods typically introduce the layout condition by integrating adapter modules into the base generative model. However, the generated images often exhibit low visual quality and stylistic inconsistency with the base model, indicating a loss of pretrained knowledge. To alleviate this issue, we construct the Layout Synthesis (LaySyn) dataset, which leverages images synthesized by the base model itself to mitigate the distribution shift from the pretraining data. Moreover, we propose the Layout Control (Laytrol) Network, in which parameters are inherited from MM-DiT to preserve the pretrained knowledge of the base model. To effectively activate the copied parameters and avoid disturbance from unstable control conditions, we adopt a dedicated initialization scheme for Laytrol. In this scheme, the layout encoder is initialized as a pure text encoder to ensure that its output tokens remain within the data domain of MM-DiT. Meanwhile, the outputs of the layout control network are initialized to zero. In addition, we apply Object-level Rotary Position Embedding to the layout tokens to provide coarse positional information. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.", "AI": {"tldr": "LaySyn\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cLaytrol\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5e03\u5c40\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u4f4e\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5e03\u5c40\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6574\u5408\u5e03\u5c40\u6761\u4ef6\u65f6\uff0c\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u77e5\u8bc6\u6709\u6240\u635f\u5931\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLaySyn\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u5408\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff1b\u63d0\u51faLaytrol\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7ee7\u627fMM-DiT\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u7279\u6b8a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5e03\u5c40\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8f93\u51fa\u5728MM-DiT\u6570\u636e\u57df\u5185\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u5e03\u5c40\u63a7\u5236\u7f51\u7edc\u8f93\u51fa\u4e3a\u96f6\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ea7\u65cb\u8f6c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u4e3a\u5e03\u5c40\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684LaySyn\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cLaytrol\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5e03\u5c40\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u98ce\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

But does this assumption hold for low-resource, morphologically rich languages such as Sanskrit? We address this question by comparing instruction-tuned and in-context-prompted LLMs with smaller task-specific encoder-decoder models on the Sanskrit poetry-to-prose conversion task. This task is intrinsically challenging: Sanskrit verse exhibits free word order combined with rigid metrical constraints, and its conversion to canonical prose (anvaya) requires multi-step reasoning involving compound segmentation, dependency resolution, and syntactic linearisation. This makes it an ideal testbed to evaluate whether LLMs can surpass specialised models. For LLMs, we apply instruction fine-tuning on general-purpose models and design in-context learning templates grounded in Paninian grammar and classical commentary heuristics. For task-specific modelling, we fully fine-tune a ByT5-Sanskrit Seq2Seq model. Our experiments show that domain-specific fine-tuning of ByT5-Sanskrit significantly outperforms all instruction-driven LLM approaches. Human evaluation strongly corroborates this result, with scores exhibiting high correlation with Kendall's Tau scores.

Fourier transforming exponentially decaying time domain signals gives Lorentzian line shapes which can be manipulated by apodization methods. The underlying transitions of spectral lines can be visualized by a Bloch vector or equivalent phase-space representations. Here, we study and generalize a surprisingly elegant geometric transform, the hyperbolism of curves originally found by Isaac Newton, which allows to transform ellipses into Lorentzian lines, and vice versa. With this, we show that the Bloch picture and especially corresponding phase-space representations are directly geometrically related to the Lorentzian line shape.

This problem is particularly important in machine learning involving high-dimensional, multimodal data such as social media, bioinformatics or recommendation systems. Existing Multi-View Multi-Label Feature Selection (MVMLFS) methods mainly focus on analyzing statistical information of data, but seldom consider semantic information. In this paper, we aim to use these two types of information jointly and propose a method that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) semantic reasoning with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) structural modeling for MVMLFS. Specifically, the method consists of three main components. (1) LLM is first used as an evaluation agent to assess the latent semantic relevance among feature, view, and label descriptions. (2) A semantic-aware heterogeneous graph with two levels is designed to represent relations among features, views and labels: one is a semantic graph representing semantic relations, and the other is a statistical graph. (3) A lightweight Graph Attention Network (GAT) is applied to learn node embedding in the heterogeneous graph as feature saliency scores for ranking and selection.

Many downstream applications, however, demand enforcing hard constraints on generated samples (for example, robot trajectories must avoid obstacles), a requirement that goes beyond simple guidance. Prevailing projection-based approaches constrain the entire sampling path to the constraint manifold, which is overly restrictive and degrades sample quality. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that reformulates hard-constrained sampling as a trajectory optimization problem. Our key insight is to leverage numerical optimal control to steer the sampling trajectory so that constraints are satisfied precisely at the terminal time. By exploiting the underlying structure of flow-matching models and adopting techniques from model predictive control, we transform this otherwise complex constrained optimization problem into a tractable surrogate that can be solved efficiently and effectively. Furthermore, this trajectory optimization perspective offers significant flexibility beyond mere constraint satisfaction, allowing for the inclusion of integral costs to minimize distribution shift and terminal objectives to further enhance sample quality, all within a unified framework. We provide a control-theoretic analysis of our method, establishing bounds on the approximation error between our tractable surrogate and the ideal formulation.

A significant challenge remains in implementing DP optimizers that retain strong performance while preserving privacy. Recent advances introduced ever more efficient optimizers, with AdamW being a popular choice for training deep learning models because of strong empirical performance. We study \\emph{DP-AdamW} and introduce \\emph{DP-AdamW-BC}, a differentially private variant of the AdamW optimizer with DP bias correction for the second moment estimator. We start by showing theoretical results for privacy and convergence guarantees of DP-AdamW and DP-AdamW-BC. Then, we empirically analyze the behavior of both optimizers across multiple privacy budgets ($\u03b5= 1, 3, 7$). We find that DP-AdamW outperforms existing state-of-the-art differentially private optimizers like DP-SGD, DP-Adam, and DP-AdamBC, scoring over 15\\% higher on text classification, up to 5\\% higher on image classification, and consistently 1\\% higher on graph node classification.

Accepted to WACV 2026", "summary": "Change detection (CD) is fundamental to computer vision and remote sensing, supporting applications in environmental monitoring, disaster response, and urban development. Most CD models assume co-registered inputs, yet real-world imagery often exhibits parallax, viewpoint shifts, and long temporal gaps that cause severe misalignment. Traditional two stage methods that first register and then detect, as well as recent joint frameworks (e.g., BiFA, ChangeRD), still struggle under large displacements, relying on regression only flow, global homographies, or synthetic perturbations. We present DiffRegCD, an integrated framework that unifies dense registration and change detection in a single model. DiffRegCD reformulates correspondence estimation as a Gaussian smoothed classification task, achieving sub-pixel accuracy and stable training. It leverages frozen multi-scale features from a pretrained denoising diffusion model, ensuring robustness to illumination and viewpoint variation. Supervision is provided through controlled affine perturbations applied to standard CD datasets, yielding paired ground truth for both flow and change detection without pseudo labels. Extensive experiments on aerial (LEVIR-CD, DSIFN-CD, WHU-CD, SYSU-CD) and ground level (VL-CMU-CD) datasets show that DiffRegCD consistently surpasses recent baselines and remains reliable under wide temporal and geometric variation, establishing diffusion features and classification based correspondence as a strong foundation for unified change detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "DiffRegCD\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u5bc6\u96c6\u914d\u51c6\u548c\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u5bf9\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u5e73\u6ed1\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e9a\u50cf\u7d20\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51bb\u7ed3\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u5bf9\u5149\u7167\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6807\u51c6CD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u4eff\u5c04\u6270\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u6d41\u548c\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u914d\u5bf9\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u591a\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08CD\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5047\u8bbe\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u5df2\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f46\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u901a\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u89c6\u5dee\u3001\u89c6\u89d2\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u95f4\u9694\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u9519\u4f4d\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8fd1\u671f\u7684\u8054\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5927\u7684\u4f4d\u79fb\u4e0b\u4ecd\u7136\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u3002", "method": "DiffRegCD\u5c06\u5bf9\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u5e73\u6ed1\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51bb\u7ed3\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6807\u51c6CD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u4eff\u5c04\u6270\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u6d41\u548c\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u914d\u5bf9\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u822a\u7a7a\uff08LEVIR-CD\u3001DSIFN-CD\u3001WHU-CD\u3001SYSU-CD\uff09\u548c\u5730\u9762\uff08VL-CMU-CD\uff09\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDiffRegCD\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u4ecd\u7136\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "conclusion": "DiffRegCD\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u5bc6\u96c6\u914d\u51c6\u548c\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u7edf\u4e00\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u5b83\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u662f\u7edf\u4e00\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6709\u529b\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

The counterdiabatic method offers an analytical framework for accelerating high-fidelity gates by mimicking the time evolution of a counterdiabatic Hamiltonian using fast-oscillating fields. This approach is contrasted with a numerically optimized gate designed using the Boulder Opal platform. The numerically optimized gate achieves higher fidelities while demonstrating robustness against errors similar to that of the effective counterdiabatic gate. The study serves as an example of the performance of analytic shortcut-to-adiabatic-inspired protocols compared to brute-force numerical optimization techniques for state-of-the-art quantum computing platforms.

To explore this issue, we propose a new perturbation framework to evaluate LLMs' reasoning ability in complex environments by injecting additional semantically irrelevant perturbation sentences and gradually increasing the perturbation intensity. At the same time, we use an additional perturbation method: core questioning instruction missing, to further analyze the LLMs' problem-solving mechanism. The experimental results show that LLMs perform stably when facing perturbation sentences without numbers, but there is also a robustness boundary. As the perturbation intensity increases, the performance exhibits varying degrees of decline; when facing perturbation sentences with numbers, the performance decreases more significantly, most open source models with smaller parameters decrease by nearly or even more than 10%, and further increasing with the enhancement of perturbation intensity, with the maximum decrease reaching 51.55%. Even the most advanced commercial LLMs have seen a 3%-10% performance drop. By analyzing the reasoning process of LLMs in detail, We find that models are more sensitive to perturbations with numerical information and are more likely to give incorrect answers when disturbed by irrelevant numerical information. The higher the perturbation intensity, the more obvious these defects are. At the same time, in the absence of core questioning instruction, models can still maintain an accuracy of 20%-40%, indicating that LLMs may rely on memory templates or pattern matching to complete the task, rather than logical reasoning.

To prove their universal approximation properties, existing works typically rely on model-specific proofs. Generally, they construct a dedicated mathematical formulation for each architecture (e.g., fully connected networks, CNNs, or Transformers) and then prove their universal approximability. However, this approach suffers from two major limitations: first, every newly proposed architecture often requires a completely new proof from scratch; second, these proofs are largely isolated from one another, lacking a common analytical foundation. This not only incurs significant redundancy but also hinders unified theoretical understanding across different network families. To address these issues, this paper proposes a general and modular framework for proving universal approximation. We define a basic building block (comprising one or multiple layers) that possesses the universal approximation property as a Universal Approximation Module (UAM). Under this condition, we show that any deep network composed of such modules inherently retains the universal approximation property. Moreover, the overall approximation process can be interpreted as a progressive refinement across modules. This perspective not only unifies the analysis of diverse architectures but also enables a step-by-step understanding of how expressive power evolves through the network.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u7528\u903c\u8fd1\u6027\u8bc1\u660e\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u901a\u7528\u903c\u8fd1\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u6a21\u5757\uff08UAM\uff09\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7531UAM\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u4e5f\u5177\u6709\u901a\u7528\u903c\u8fd1\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u7528\u903c\u8fd1\u6027\u8bc1\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\u9700\u4ece\u5934\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u4e14\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u8bc1\u660e\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u901a\u7528\u903c\u8fd1\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6784\u5efa\u5757\uff08UAM\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7531UAM\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u5929\u7136\u5177\u6709\u901a\u7528\u903c\u8fd1\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5c06\u903c\u8fd1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u89c6\u4e3a\u8de8\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u7ec6\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u6790\u5404\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u901a\u7528\u903c\u8fd1\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9010\u6b65\u7406\u89e3\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u8bc1\u660e\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u6f14\u53d8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Currently, TFG methods based on Neural Radiated Field (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian sputtering (3DGS) are received widespread attention. They learn and store personalized features from reference videos of each target individual to generate realistic speaking videos. To ensure models can capture sufficient 3D information and successfully learns the lip-audio mapping, previous studies usually require meticulous processing and fitting several minutes of reference video, which always takes hours. The computational burden of processing and fitting long reference videos severely limits the practical application value of these methods.However, is it really necessary to fit such minutes of reference video? Our exploratory case studies show that using some informative reference video segments of just a few seconds can achieve performance comparable to or even better than the full reference video. This indicates that video informative quality is much more important than its length. Inspired by this observation, we propose the ISExplore (short for Informative Segment Explore), a simple-yet-effective segment selection strategy that automatically identifies the informative 5-second reference video segment based on three key data quality dimensions: audio feature diversity, lip movement amplitude, and number of camera views. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach increases data processing and training speed by more than 5x for NeRF and 3DGS methods, while maintaining high-fidelity output.

While large language models(LLMs) show promise in such tasks, their application to biomolecular problems is hindered by logical inconsistencies and the lack of grounding in domain knowledge. Existing approaches often exacerbate these issues: reasoning steps may deviate from biological facts or fail to capture long mechanistic dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose a Knowledge-Augmented Long-CoT Reasoning framework that integrates LLMs with knowledge graph-based multi-hop reasoning chains. The framework constructs mechanistic chains via guided multi-hop traversal and pruning on the knowledge graph; these chains are then incorporated into supervised fine-tuning to improve factual grounding and further refined with reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning reliability and consistency. Furthermore, to overcome the shortcomings of existing benchmarks, which are often restricted in scale and scope and lack annotations for deep reasoning chains, we introduce PrimeKGQA, a comprehensive benchmark for biomolecular question answering. Experimental results on both PrimeKGQA and existing datasets demonstrate that although larger closed-source models still perform well on relatively simple tasks, our method demonstrates clear advantages as reasoning depth increases, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-hop tasks that demand traversal of structured biological knowledge. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining structured knowledge with advanced reasoning strategies for reliable and interpretable biomolecular reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\u5728\u751f\u7269\u5206\u5b50\u673a\u5236\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u548c\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5bfc\u591a\u8df3\u904d\u5386\u548c\u526a\u679d\u6784\u5efa\u673a\u5236\u94fe\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u5f15\u5165PrimeKGQA\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u751f\u7269\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u591a\u8df3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u751f\u7269\u5206\u5b50\u673a\u5236\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u673a\u5236\u4f9d\u8d56\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff08Knowledge-Augmented Long-CoT Reasoning\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5bfc\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e0a\u7684\u591a\u8df3\u904d\u5386\u548c\u526a\u679d\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u673a\u5236\u94fe\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u94fe\u7eb3\u5165\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165PrimeKGQA\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5206\u5b50\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728PrimeKGQA\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4ecd\u7136\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5728\u9700\u8981\u904d\u5386\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u751f\u7269\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u591a\u8df3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5206\u5b50\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u548cPrimeKGQA\u57fa\u51c6\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u751f\u7269\u5206\u5b50\u673a\u5236\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

Recent work suggests that the underlying causal graphs of such dynamics models are sparsely connected, with each of the future state variables depending only on a small subset of the current state variables, and that learning may therefore benefit from sparsity priors. Similarly, temporal sparsity, i.e. sparsely and abruptly changing local dynamics, has also been proposed as a useful inductive bias.\n  In this work, we critically examine these assumptions by analyzing ground-truth dynamics from a set of robotic reinforcement learning environments in the MuJoCo Playground benchmark suite, aiming to determine whether the proposed notions of state and temporal sparsity actually tend to hold in typical reinforcement learning tasks.\n  We study (i) whether the causal graphs of environment dynamics are sparse, (ii) whether such sparsity is state-dependent, and (iii) whether local system dynamics change sparsely.\n  Our results indicate that global sparsity is rare, but instead the tasks show local, state-dependent sparsity in their dynamics and this sparsity exhibits distinct structures, appearing in temporally localized clusters (e.g., during contact events) and affecting specific subsets of state dimensions. These findings challenge common sparsity prior assumptions in dynamics learning, emphasizing the need for grounded inductive biases that reflect the state-dependent sparsity structure of real-world dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f53\u524d RL \u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u662f\u72b6\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u65f6\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u662f\u5426\u5177\u6709\u72b6\u6001\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3002\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u7684 RL \u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790 MuJoCo Playground \u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u662f\u5426\u7a00\u758f\uff1f2\uff09\u8fd9\u79cd\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u662f\u5426\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\uff1f3\uff09\u5c40\u90e8\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u662f\u5426\u7a00\u758f\u5730\u53d8\u5316\uff1f", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5168\u5c40\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u5f88\u5c11\u89c1\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u786e\u5b9e\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5c40\u90e8\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u65f6\u57df\u5c40\u90e8\u7c07\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5728\u63a5\u89e6\u4e8b\u4ef6\u671f\u95f4\uff09\u5e76\u5f71\u54cd\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5b50\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u5148\u9a8c\u5047\u8bbe\u5728\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u72b6\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u5e94\u504f\u501a\u3002"}}

A key challenge is that pathological tasks typically provide only bag-level labels, while instance-level descriptions generated by LLMs often suffer from bias due to a lack of fine-grained medical knowledge. To address this, we propose that constructing task-specific pathological entity prototypes is crucial for learning generalizable features and enhancing model interpretability. Furthermore, existing vision-language MIL methods often employ unidirectional guidance, limiting cross-modal synergy. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, Multimodal Prototype-based Multi-Instance Learning, that promotes bidirectional interaction through a balanced information compression scheme. Specifically, we leverage a frozen LLM to generate task-specific pathological entity descriptions, which are learned as text prototypes. Concurrently, the vision branch learns instance-level prototypes to mitigate the model's reliance on redundant data. For the fusion stage, we employ the Stereoscopic Optimal Transport (SOT) algorithm, which is based on a similarity metric, thereby facilitating broader semantic alignment in a higher-dimensional space.

This article presents an embedding-based benchmarking framework to detect bias in LLMs in the context of formative feedback. Using 600 authentic student essays from the AES 2.0 corpus, we constructed controlled counterfactuals along two dimensions: (i) implicit cues via lexicon-based swaps of gendered terms within essays, and (ii) explicit cues via gendered author background in the prompt. We investigated six representative LLMs (i.e. GPT-5 mini, GPT-4o mini, DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-R1-Qwen, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama-3-8B). We first quantified the response divergence with cosine and Euclidean distances over sentence embeddings, then assessed significance via permutation tests, and finally, visualised structure using dimensionality reduction. In all models, implicit manipulations reliably induced larger semantic shifts for male-female counterfactuals than for female-male. Only the GPT and Llama models showed sensitivity to explicit gender cues. These findings show that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit asymmetric semantic responses to gender substitutions, suggesting persistent gender biases in feedback they provide learners. Qualitative analyses further revealed consistent linguistic differences (e.g., more autonomy-supportive feedback under male cues vs. more controlling feedback under female cues). We discuss implications for fairness auditing of pedagogical GenAI, propose reporting standards for counterfactual evaluation in learning analytics, and outline practical guidance for prompt design and deployment to safeguard equitable feedback.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08GenAI\uff09\u5728\u5f62\u6210\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u6027\u522b\u66ff\u6362\u65f6\u4e5f\u4f1a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed9\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6559\u5e08\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08GenAI\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u6559\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528600\u7bc7\u771f\u5b9e\u7684uciones\u5b66\u751f\u8bba\u6587\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u5185\u9690\u7ebf\u7d22\uff08\u8bcd\u6c47\u66ff\u6362\uff09\u548c\u5916\u663e\u7ebf\u7d22\uff08\u4f5c\u8005\u80cc\u666f\uff09\u7684\u5bf9\u7167\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u516d\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027LLMs\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f59\u5f26\u548c\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u8ddd\u79bb\u91cf\u5316\u54cd\u5e94\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6392\u5217\u68c0\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u8457\u6027\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u7ef4\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5185\u9690\u6027\u522b\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u66ff\u6362\u6bd4\u5916\u663e\u6027\u522b\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u66ff\u6362\u5f15\u8d77\u4e86\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\u3002GPT\u548cLlama\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6027\u522b\u7ebf\u7d22\u654f\u611f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u7537\u6027\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0b\u53cd\u9988\u66f4\u5177\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5973\u6027\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0b\u53cd\u9988\u66f4\u5177\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LLMs\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u6559\u80b2\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u516c\u5e73\u5ba1\u8ba1\u3001\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bc4\u4f30\u62a5\u544a\u6807\u51c6\u4ee5\u53ca\u7528\u4e8e\u4fdd\u969c\u516c\u5e73\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u6307\u5357\u3002"}}

This work investigates a hierarchical and meta-cognitive decoding framework for four-class MI classification. We introduce a multi-scale hierarchical signal processing module that reorganizes backbone features into temporal multi-scale representations, together with an introspective uncertainty estimation module that assigns per-cycle reliability scores and guides iterative refinement. We instantiate this framework on three standard EEG backbones (EEGNet, ShallowConvNet, and DeepConvNet) and evaluate four-class MI decoding using the BCI Competition IV-2a dataset under a subject-independent setting. Across all backbones, the proposed components improve average classification accuracy and reduce inter-subject variance compared to the corresponding baselines, indicating increased robustness to subject heterogeneity and noisy trials.

Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM). Accepted Manuscript version uploaded", "summary": "Extracting robust discriminative features is a critical challenge in person re-identification (ReID). While Transformer-based methods have successfully addressed some limitations of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as their local processing nature and information loss resulting from convolution and downsampling operations, they still face the scalability issue due to the quadratic increase in memory and computational requirements with the length of the input sequence. To overcome this, we propose a pure Mamba-based person ReID framework named ReIDMamba. Specifically, we have designed a Mamba-based strong baseline that effectively leverages fine-grained, discriminative global features by introducing multiple class tokens. To further enhance robust features learning within Mamba, we have carefully designed two novel techniques. First, the multi-granularity feature extractor (MGFE) module, designed with a multi-branch architecture and class token fusion, effectively forms multi-granularity features, enhancing both discrimination ability and fine-grained coverage. Second, the ranking-aware triplet regularization (RATR) is introduced to reduce redundancy in features from multiple branches, enhancing the diversity of multi-granularity features by incorporating both intra-class and inter-class diversity constraints, thus ensuring the robustness of person features. To our knowledge, this is the pioneering work that integrates a purely Mamba-driven approach into ReID research.

The contemporary solution, halting the entire quantum computation for recalibration, is unsustainable for the long runtimes of the future algorithms. We address this challenge by unifying calibration with computation, granting the quantum error correction process a dual role: its error detection events are not only used to correct the logical quantum state, but are also repurposed as a learning signal, teaching a reinforcement learning agent to continuously steer the physical control parameters and stabilize the quantum system during the computation. We experimentally demonstrate this framework on a superconducting processor, improving the logical error rate stability of the surface code 3.5-fold against injected drift and pushing the performance beyond what is achievable with state-of-the-art traditional calibration and human-expert tuning. Simulations of surface codes up to distance-15 confirm the scalability of our method, revealing an optimization speed that is independent of the system size.

However, the key research question of identifying reasoning steps that balance complexity and computational efficiency remains unsolved. Recent research has increasingly drawn upon psychological theories to explore strategies for optimizing cognitive pathways. The LLM's final outputs and intermediate steps are regarded as System 1 and System 2, respectively. However, an in-depth exploration of the System 2 reasoning is still lacking. Therefore, we propose a novel psychologically backed Scaffold Reasoning framework for code debugging, which encompasses the Scaffold Stream, Analytic Stream, and Integration Stream. The construction of reference code within the Scaffold Stream is integrated with the buggy code analysis results produced by the Analytic Stream through the Integration Stream.

However, the redundancy in burst images leads to the increased storage and transmission demands, as well as reduced efficiency of downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a new task of Burst Image Quality Assessment (BuIQA), to evaluate the task-driven quality of each frame within a burst sequence, providing reasonable cues for burst image selection. Specifically, we establish the first benchmark dataset for BuIQA, consisting of $7,346$ burst sequences with $45,827$ images and $191,572$ annotated quality scores for multiple downstream scenarios. Inspired by the data analysis, a unified BuIQA framework is proposed to achieve an efficient adaption for BuIQA under diverse downstream scenarios. Specifically, a task-driven prompt generation network is developed with heterogeneous knowledge distillation, to learn the priors of the downstream task. Then, the task-aware quality assessment network is introduced to assess the burst image quality based on the task prompt. Extensive experiments across 10 downstream scenarios demonstrate the impressive BuIQA performance of the proposed approach, outperforming the state-of-the-art.

These results demonstrate the persistence of impact-induced chaos under quantum dissipation and elucidate how environmental fluctuations influence non-linear dynamics in open quantum systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u590d\u6570\u91cf\u5b50 Langevin \u65b9\u7a0b\uff08c-number QLE\uff09\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u533a\u57df\u5185\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5468\u671f\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u8017\u6563\u7684\u8f6f\u78b0\u649e\u632f\u8361\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6df7\u6c8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5468\u671f\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u8017\u6563\u7684\u8f6f\u78b0\u649e\u632f\u8361\u5668\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u533a\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6df7\u6c8c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u73af\u5883\u6ce2\u52a8\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u590d\u6570\u91cf\u5b50 Langevin \u65b9\u7a0b\uff08c-number QLE\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c94\u56fe\u3001Lyapunov \u6307\u6570\u3001\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u9891\u8c31\u548c 0-1 \u6d4b\u8bd5\u7b49\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u5e73\u5747\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u6539\u53d8\u58c1\u9762\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u5468\u671f\u8fd0\u52a8\u5230\u591a\u5468\u671f\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5230\u6df7\u6c8c\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8f6c\u53d8\u548c\u78b0\u649e\u5206\u5c94\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u78b0\u649e\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6df7\u6c8c\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8017\u6563\u4e0b\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5e76\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u73af\u5883\u6ce2\u52a8\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002"}}

Existing methods generally suffer from limited scalability, weak semantic preservation, and high costs. Therefore, we propose MSCR, an automated adversarial attack method based on multi-source candidate replacement. By combining three information sources including cosine similarity in the embedding space of LLMs, the WordNet dictionary, and contextual predictions from a masked language model, we generate for each word in the input question a set of semantically similar candidates, which are then filtered and substituted one by one to carry out the attack. We conduct large-scale experiments on LLMs using the GSM8K and MATH500 benchmarks. The results show that even a slight perturbation involving only a single word can significantly reduce the accuracy of all models, with the maximum drop reaching 49.89% on GSM8K and 35.40% on MATH500, while preserving the high semantic consistency of the perturbed questions. Further analysis reveals that perturbations not only lead to incorrect outputs but also substantially increase the average response length, which results in more redundant reasoning paths and higher computational resource consumption. These findings highlight the robustness deficiencies and efficiency bottlenecks of current LLMs in mathematical reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u5fae\u5c0f\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002MSCR\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u3001WordNet\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u66ff\u6362\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u8bcd\u8bed\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86LLMs\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u54cd\u5e94\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u73b0\u6709LLMs\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728LLMs\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u5f31\u548c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6e90\u5019\u9009\u8bcd\u66ff\u6362\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5MSCR\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86LLMs\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u3001WordNet\u8bcd\u5178\u4ee5\u53ca\u63a9\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5355\u8bcd\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5019\u9009\u8bcd\uff0c\u5e76\u9010\u4e00\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u66ff\u6362\u4ee5\u5b9e\u65bd\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728GSM8K\u548cMATH500\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4ec5\u6d89\u53ca\u5355\u4e2a\u5355\u8bcd\u7684\u5fae\u5c0f\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728GSM8K\u4e0a\u7684\u6700\u5927\u964d\u5e45\u8fbe49.89%\uff0c\u5728MATH500\u4e0a\u7684\u6700\u5927\u964d\u5e45\u8fbe35.40%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6270\u52a8\u540e\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u9ad8\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6270\u52a8\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f93\u51fa\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u8fd8\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5e73\u5747\u54cd\u5e94\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u6709LLMs\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\u548c\u6548\u7387\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

Although it is quite popular to collect point clouds and images simultaneously, little attention has been paid to the usefulness of image data in 3D UDA when training the models. In this paper, we propose an approach named MMAssist that improves the performance of 3D UDA with multi-modal assistance. A method is designed to align 3D features between the source domain and the target domain by using image and text features as bridges. More specifically, we project the ground truth labels or pseudo labels to the images to get a set of 2D bounding boxes. For each 2D box, we extract its image feature from a pre-trained vision backbone. A large vision-language model (LVLM) is adopted to extract the box's text description, and a pre-trained text encoder is used to obtain its text feature. During the training of the model in the source domain and the student model in the target domain, we align the 3D features of the predicted boxes with their corresponding image and text features, and the 3D features and the aligned features are fused with learned weights for the final prediction. The features between the student branch and the teacher branch in the target domain are aligned as well. To enhance the pseudo labels, we use an off-the-shelf 2D object detector to generate 2D bounding boxes from images and estimate their corresponding 3D boxes with the aid of point cloud, and these 3D boxes are combined with the pseudo labels generated by the teacher model. Experimental results show that our approach achieves promising performance compared with state-of-the-art methods in three domain adaptation tasks on three popular 3D object detection datasets.

Unlike general text generation, parliamentary speeches require not only linguistic quality but also political authenticity and ideological consistency. Current language models lack specialized training for parliamentary contexts, and existing evaluation methods focus on standard NLP metrics rather than political authenticity. To address this, we present ParliaBench, a benchmark for parliamentary speech generation. We constructed a dataset of speeches from UK Parliament to enable systematic model training. We introduce an evaluation framework combining computational metrics with LLM-as-a-judge assessments for measuring generation quality across three dimensions: linguistic quality, semantic coherence, and political authenticity. We propose two novel embedding-based metrics, Political Spectrum Alignment and Party Alignment, to quantify ideological positioning. We fine-tuned five large language models (LLMs), generated 28k speeches, and evaluated them using our framework, comparing baseline and fine-tuned models. Results show that fine-tuning produces statistically significant improvements across the majority of metrics and our novel metrics demonstrate strong discriminative power for political dimensions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ParliaBench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bae\u4f1a\u6f14\u8bb2\u751f\u6210\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u82f1\u56fd\u8bae\u4f1a\u6f14\u8bb2\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6307\u6807\u548cLLM-as-a-judge\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4ee5\u8861\u91cf\u8bed\u8a00\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u653f\u6cbb\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u653f\u515a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4e94\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u5fae\u8c03\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6307\u6807\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u65b0\u7684\u6307\u6807\u5728\u533a\u5206\u653f\u6cbb\u7ef4\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bae\u4f1a\u6f14\u8bb2\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7279\u5b9a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u8d8a\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd8\u9700\u5177\u5907\u653f\u6cbb\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u8bae\u4f1a\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4e13\u95e8\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e5f\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u653f\u6cbb\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u82f1\u56fd\u8bae\u4f1a\u6f14\u8bb2\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6307\u6807\u548cLLM-as-a-judge\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4ee5\u8861\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1a\u8bed\u8a00\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u653f\u6cbb\u5149\u8c31\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u653f\u515a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e94\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e8628,000\u7bc7\u6f14\u8bb2\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u65b0\u7684\u6307\u6807\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f88\u5f3a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684ParliaBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8861\u91cf\u8bae\u4f1a\u6f14\u8bb2\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u653f\u6cbb\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u7684\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bae\u4f1a\u6f14\u8bb2\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

This is particularly true when we focus on highly-constrained early fault-tolerant devices. Many attempts to optimize algorithms for early fault-tolerance focus on simple metrics, such as the circuit depth or T-count. These metrics fail to capture critical overheads, such as the spacetime cost of Clifford operations and routing, or miss they key optimizations. We propose the FLuid Allocation of Surface code Qubits (FLASQ) cost model, tailored for architectures that use a two-dimensional lattice of qubits to implement the two-dimensional surface code. FLASQ abstracts away the complexity of routing by assuming that ancilla space and time can be fluidly rearranged, allowing for the tractable estimation of spacetime volume while still capturing important details neglected by simpler approaches. At the same time, it enforces constraints imposed by the circuit's measurement depth and the processor's reaction time. We apply FLASQ to analyze the cost of a standard two-dimensional lattice model simulation, finding that modern advances (such as magic state cultivation and the combination of quantum error correction and mitigation) reduce both the time and space required for this task by an order of magnitude compared with previous estimates. We also analyze the Hamming weight phasing approach to synthesizing parallel rotations, revealing that despite its low T-count, the overhead from imposing a 2D layout and from its use of additional ancilla qubits will make it challenging to benefit from in early fault-tolerance. We hope that the FLASQ cost model will help to better align early fault-tolerant algorithmic design with actual hardware realization costs without demanding excessive knowledge of quantum error correction from quantum algorithmists.", "AI": {"tldr": "FLASQ\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u6210\u672c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u5bb9\u9519\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u5b83\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u4f30\u8ba1\u65f6\u7a7a\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u7535\u8def\u6df1\u5ea6\u6216T\u8ba1\u6570\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u65e9\u671f\u5bb9\u9519\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8d44\u6e90\u5f00\u9500\uff08\u5982Clifford\u8fd0\u7b97\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6210\u672c\u548c\u8def\u7531\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6210\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFLASQ\uff08\u6d41\u4f53\u5206\u914d\u8868\u9762\u7801\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\uff09\u6210\u672c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e8c\u7ef4\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u683c\u70b9\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4e8c\u7ef4\u8868\u9762\u7801\u3002FLASQ\u901a\u8fc7\u5047\u8bbe\u5408\u9002\u7684ancilla\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u6d41\u4f53\u5f0f\u91cd\u6392\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u4f30\u7b97\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f53\u79ef\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u7535\u8def\u6d4b\u91cf\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u5904\u7406\u5668\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u7b49\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "FLASQ\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff1a1. \u6a21\u62df\u6807\u51c6\u4e8c\u7ef4\u683c\u70b9\u6a21\u578b\u6240\u9700\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f53\u79ef\uff0c\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u4f30\u8ba1\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u9b54\u6cd5\u6001\u57f9\u517b\u548c\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u4e0e\u7f13\u89e3\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u30022. \u6c49\u660e\u6743\u91cd\u76f8\u4f4d\u6cd5\uff08\u4e00\u79cd\u5408\u6210\u5e76\u884c\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1T\u8ba1\u6570\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5e03\u5c40\u548c\u989d\u5916\u7684ancilla\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u5bb9\u9519\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "FLASQ\u6210\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u5bb9\u9519\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u786c\u4ef6\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6210\u672c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u8f7b\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8005\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u4e86\u89e3\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

RL typically employs reward functions to define task objectives and guide agent learning. However, since the reward function serves the dual purpose of defining the optimal goal and guiding learning, it is challenging to design the reward function manually, which often results in a suboptimal task representation. To tackle the reward design challenge in RL, inspired by the satisficing theory, we propose a Test-driven Reinforcement Learning (TdRL) framework. In the TdRL framework, multiple test functions are used to represent the task objective rather than a single reward function. Test functions can be categorized as pass-fail tests and indicative tests, each dedicated to defining the optimal objective and guiding the learning process, respectively, thereby making defining tasks easier. Building upon such a task definition, we first prove that if a trajectory return function assigns higher returns to trajectories closer to the optimal trajectory set, maximum entropy policy optimization based on this return function will yield a policy that is closer to the optimal policy set. Then, we introduce a lexicographic heuristic approach to compare the relative distance relationship between trajectories and the optimal trajectory set for learning the trajectory return function. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm implementation of TdRL. Experimental results on the DeepMind Control Suite benchmark demonstrate that TdRL matches or outperforms handcrafted reward methods in policy training, with greater design simplicity and inherent support for multi-objective optimization. We argue that TdRL offers a novel perspective for representing task objectives, which could be helpful in addressing the reward design challenges in RL applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Test-driven Reinforcement Learning (TdRL) uses multiple test functions instead of a single reward function to define robot control task objectives, simplifying design and improving learning compared to traditional reward-based RL.", "motivation": "Designing reward functions for Reinforcement Learning (RL) is challenging because they serve dual purposes: defining the optimal goal and guiding learning, often leading to suboptimal task representations.

To appear in WACV 2026", "summary": "Remote sensing change detection is often challenged by spatial misalignment between bi-temporal images, especially when acquisitions are separated by long seasonal or multi-year gaps. While modern convolutional and transformer-based models perform well on aligned data, their reliance on precise co-registration limits their robustness in real-world conditions. Existing joint registration-detection frameworks typically require retraining and transfer poorly across domains. We introduce a modular pipeline that improves spatial and temporal robustness without altering existing change detection networks. The framework integrates diffusion-based semantic morphing, dense registration, and residual flow refinement. A diffusion module synthesizes intermediate morphing frames that bridge large appearance gaps, enabling RoMa to estimate stepwise correspondences between consecutive frames. The composed flow is then refined through a lightweight U-Net to produce a high-fidelity warp that co-registers the original image pair.

Specifically, we explore whether VLLMs can infer the hierarchical structure of tables without additional processing. As a basis for our experiments we use the PubTables-1M dataset, a large-scale corpus of scientific tables. From this dataset, we extract a subset of tables that we introduce as Complex Hierarchical Tables (CHiTab): a benchmark collection of complex tables containing hierarchical headings. We adopt a series of prompt engineering strategies to probe the models' comprehension capabilities, experimenting with various prompt formats and writing styles. Multiple state-of-the-art open-weights VLLMs are evaluated on the benchmark first using their off-the-shelf versions and then fine-tuning some models on our task. We also measure the performance of humans to solve the task on a small set of tables comparing with performance of the evaluated VLLMs. The experiments support our intuition that generic VLLMs, not explicitly designed for understanding the structure of tables, can perform this task.

We work in the setting of deep thermalization from many-body physics: starting from a bipartite state on a global system $(A,B)$ drawn from a $k$-design, we measure system $B$ in the computational basis, keep the outcome and examine the state that remains in system $A$, approximating the overall ensemble (the 'projected ensemble') by a $k'$-design. We ask: how does the design quality change due to this procedure, or how does $k'$ compare to $k$? We give the first rigorous example of unitary dynamics generating a state such that, projection at very early (constant) times can boost design randomness. These dynamics are those of quantum chaos, modeled by the evolution of a Hamiltonian drawn from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). We show that, even though a state generated by such dynamics at constant time only forms a $k=\\mathcal{O}(1)$ design, the projected ensemble is Haar-random (or a $k'=\\infty$ design) in the thermodynamic limit (i.e. when $N_B=\\infty$). This phenomenon persists even with weaker and more physically realistic assumptions; our results can be appropriately applied to non-GUE Hamiltonians that nevertheless show likely chaotic signatures in their eigenbases. Moreover, we show that with no assumption on how the global state was generated, a $k$-design experiences a degradation in design quality to $k' = \\lfloor k/2 \\rfloor$. This improves upon best prior results on the deep thermalization of designs. Together, our contributions argue for design boosting as a result of chaos and showcase a novel mechanism to generate good designs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u6a21\u3002\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u70ed\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4ecek-\u8bbe\u8ba1\u72b6\u6001\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edfB\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97A\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd1\u4f3ck'-\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8k'\u4e0ek\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002 GUE\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06k=O(1)\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u5347\u4e3ak'=\u221e\uff08Haar-\u968f\u673a\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u8be5\u73b0\u8c61\u5728\u975eGUE\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u4e0b\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u5168\u5c40\u72b6\u6001\u751f\u6210\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0ck-\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6295\u5f71\u540e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u4f1a\u8870\u51cf\u4e3ak'=\u230ak/2\u230b\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u5bf9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u70ed\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff08\u4ee5k-\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5ea6\u91cf\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u63d0\u5347\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u70ed\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ece\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e8c\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\uff08A, B\uff09\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u8be5\u72b6\u6001\u7531k-\u8bbe\u8ba1\u751f\u6210\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u57fa\u4e0b\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edfB\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u7cfb\u7edfA\u4e2d\u5269\u4f59\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u5206\u6790\u8be5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u7cfb\u7edfA\u7684\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2ak'-\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83k'\u548ck\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5730\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u7531\u9ad8\u65af\u5e7a\u6b63\u7cfb\u7efc\uff08GUE\uff09Hamiltonian\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6052\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6295\u5f71\u540e\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u968f\u673a\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u65e0\u5047\u8bbe\u5168\u5c40\u72b6\u6001\u751f\u6210\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0ck-\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6295\u5f71\u540e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8eGUE\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6052\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0b\uff0c\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u4ec5\u6784\u6210k=O(1)\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edfB\u540e\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edfA\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u7cfb\u7efc\u5728\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\uff08N_B=\u221e\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u6210\u4e3aHaar-\u968f\u673a\uff08k'=\u221e\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u8be5\u73b0\u8c61\u4e5f\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u6df7\u6c8c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u975eGUE\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u3002\u5728\u65e0\u5168\u5c40\u72b6\u6001\u751f\u6210\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0ck-\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6295\u5f71\u540e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u4f1a\u8870\u51cf\u4e3ak'=\u230ak/2\u230b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u63d0\u5347\u8bbe\u8ba1\u968f\u673a\u6027\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u6709\u9650\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u6df7\u6c8c\u4e5f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230Haar\u968f\u673a\u6027\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e5f\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u66f4\u666e\u904d\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Anomaly detection in this type of data constitutes a challenging problem yet with numerous applications in science and engineering because anomaly scores come from the simultaneous consideration of the temporal and variable relationships. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based approach to detect anomalies concerning the amplitude and the shape of multivariate time series. First, we use a sliding window to generate a set of multivariate subsequences and thereafter apply an extended fuzzy clustering to reveal a structure present within the generated multivariate subsequences. Finally, a reconstruction criterion is employed to reconstruct the multivariate subsequences with the optimal cluster centers and the partition matrix. We construct a confidence index to quantify a level of anomaly detected in the series and apply Particle Swarm Optimization as an optimization vehicle for the problem of anomaly detection. Experimental studies completed on several synthetic and six real-world datasets suggest that the proposed methods can detect the anomalies in multivariate time series. With the help of available clusters revealed by the extended fuzzy clustering, the proposed framework can detect anomalies in the multivariate time series and is suitable for identifying anomalous amplitude and shape patterns in various application domains such as health care, weather data analysis, finance, and disease outbreak detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u5e45\u5ea6\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6709\u8bb8\u591a\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u53d8\u91cf\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u751f\u6210\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u7cca\u805a\u7c7b\u63ed\u793a\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u5efa\u51c6\u5219\u548c\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u5065\u3001\u5929\u6c14\u5206\u6790\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u548c\u75be\u75c5\u7206\u53d1\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u5e45\u5ea6\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u7cca\u805a\u7c7b\u63ed\u793a\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

Each episode has five support pairs and one query serialized in 256 tokens, enabling rapid iteration with small models while exposing a controllable task space with explicit knobs for alphabet size k, radius r, rule family, Langton's lambda, query coverage, and cell entropy. We release 95k training episodes plus two 1k test splits (interpolation/extrapolation) and evaluate symbolic, recurrent, convolutional, transformer, recursive, and LLM baselines. CellARC decouples generalization from anthropomorphic priors, supports unlimited difficulty-controlled sampling, and enables reproducible studies of how quickly models infer new rules under tight budgets. Our strongest small-model baseline (a 10M-parameter vanilla transformer) outperforms recent recursive models (TRM, HRM), reaching 58.0%/32.4% per-token accuracy on the interpolation/extrapolation splits, while a large closed model (GPT-5 High) attains 62.3%/48.1% on subsets of 100 test tasks. An ensemble that chooses per episode between the Transformer and the best symbolic baseline reaches 65.4%/35.5%, highlighting neuro-symbolic complementarity.

Existing methods typically assume fixed input/output densities or rely on image-based representations, making them less suitable for real-world scenarios with variable sparsity and limited supervision. In this paper, we introduce Density-agnostic and Class-aware Network (DANCE), a novel framework that completes only the missing regions while preserving the observed geometry. DANCE generates candidate points via ray-based sampling from multiple viewpoints. A transformer decoder then refines their positions and predicts opacity scores, which determine the validity of each point for inclusion in the final surface. To incorporate semantic guidance, a lightweight classification head is trained directly on geometric features, enabling category-consistent completion without external image supervision. Extensive experiments on the PCN and MVP benchmarks show that DANCE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and structural consistency, while remaining robust to varying input densities and noise levels.", "AI": {"tldr": "DANCE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u8865\u5168\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u6839\u636e\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ea\u8865\u5168\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u533a\u57df\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5c04\u7ebf\u91c7\u6837\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u70b9\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u7528Transformer\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4f18\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u70b9\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u7f51\u7edc\u8fd8\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5934\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u522b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u8865\u5168\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDANCE\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u5404\u79cd\u8f93\u5165\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u70b9\u4e91\u8865\u5168\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u5904\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u53d8\u5316\u591a\u6837\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u70b9\u4e91\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fe\u50cf\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u8865\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "DANCE\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c04\u7ebf\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u6765\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u70b9\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u5229\u7528Transformer\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5019\u9009\u70b9\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u6bcf\u4e2a\u70b9\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u5c06\u5176\u5305\u542b\u5728\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u8868\u9762\u4e2d\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0cDANCE\u8fd8\u5305\u542b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5934\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u522b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u8865\u5168\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "result": "\u5728PCN\u548cMVP\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cDANCE\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "DANCE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u8865\u5168\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u70b9\u5e76\u5229\u7528Transformer\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5206\u7c7b\u5934\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u522b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u8865\u5168\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5bc6\u5ea6\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86DANCE\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Moreover, these methods often fail to capture the complex argumentative reasoning and negotiation dynamics inherent in reviewer-author interactions. To address these limitations, we propose ReViewGraph (Reviewer-Author Debates Graph Reasoner), a novel framework that performs heterogeneous graph reasoning over LLM-simulated multi-round reviewer-author debates. In our approach, reviewer-author exchanges are simulated through LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. Diverse opinion relations (e.g., acceptance, rejection, clarification, and compromise) are then explicitly extracted and encoded as typed edges within a heterogeneous interaction graph. By applying graph neural networks to reason over these structured debate graphs, ReViewGraph captures fine-grained argumentative dynamics and enables more informed review decisions.

Encompassing both all-pass and add-drop geometries, identical and distinct pump and biphoton coupling coefficients, and continuous-wave and pulsed pumping, our interaction-picture-based approach reveals time-frequency biphoton correlations while also predicting absolute generation rates. Under continuous-wave excitation, we find critical coupling of both the pump and biphoton to maximize the rate of single photons extracted from the microring, whereas critical coupling of the pump but overcoupling of the biphoton maximize the two-photon rate. Under pulsed pumping, overcoupling of both pump and biphoton (to different degrees) maximizes photon extraction probabilities, albeit under a tradeoff with spectral factorability that we quantify via parameter scans over a range of coupler pairings. As a whole, our formalism should prove valuable for the practical design of integrated photon sources, merging a flexible and intuitive biphoton-centric depiction with quantitative predictions closely tied to experimental parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u73af\u8c10\u632f\u5668\u4e2d\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u6cf5\u6d66\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u548c\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u4ea7\u751f\u7387\u4ee5\u53ca\u65f6\u95f4-\u9891\u7387\u5173\u8054\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u5fae\u73af\u8c10\u632f\u5668\u4e2d\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u7684\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u6570\u548c\u6cf5\u6d66\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u5149\u5b50\u6e90\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7ed8\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u6ce2\u548c\u8109\u51b2\u6cf5\u6d66\u4e0b\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u7387\u548c\u5149\u5b50\u63d0\u53d6\u6982\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u6ce2\u6cf5\u6d66\u4e0b\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u63d0\u53d6\u7387\u9700\u8981\u6cf5\u6d66\u548c\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u90fd\u5904\u4e8e\u4e34\u754c\u8026\u5408\u72b6\u6001\uff1b\u800c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u4ea7\u751f\u7387\u5219\u9700\u8981\u6cf5\u6d66\u4e34\u754c\u8026\u5408\u4f46\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u8fc7\u8026\u5408\u3002\u5728\u8109\u51b2\u6cf5\u6d66\u4e0b\uff0c\u6cf5\u6d66\u548c\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u90fd\u8fc7\u8026\u5408\uff08\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0d\u540c\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5149\u5b50\u63d0\u53d6\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5149\u8c31\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u4e2d\u5fc3\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53c2\u6570\u7d27\u5bc6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6709\u76ca\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u96c6\u6210\u5149\u5b50\u6e90\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

A five-pillar architecture--governance, data lineage, assurance, resilience, and regulatory alignment--translates supervisory expectations from Solvency II, SR 11-7, and guidance from EIOPA (2025), NAIC (2023), and IAIS (2024) into measurable lifecycle controls. The framework is implemented through the Reinsurance AI Reliability and Assurance Benchmark (RAIRAB), which evaluates whether governance-embedded LLMs meet prudential standards for grounding, transparency, and accountability. Across six task families, retrieval-grounded configurations achieved higher grounding accuracy (0.90), reduced hallucination and interpretive drift by roughly 40%, and nearly doubled transparency. These mechanisms lower informational frictions in risk transfer and capital allocation, showing that existing prudential doctrines already accommodate reliable AI when governance is explicit, data are traceable, and assurance is verifiable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u518d\u4fdd\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684AI\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6cbb\u7406\u3001\u6570\u636e\u8c31\u7cfb\u3001\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3001\u97e7\u6027\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fd9\u4e94\u5927\u652f\u67f1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u518d\u4fdd\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684AI\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u53d1\u5c55\u4e00\u4e2a\u5ba1\u614e\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u62ec\u6cbb\u7406\u3001\u6570\u636e\u8c31\u7cfb\u3001\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3001\u97e7\u6027\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fd9\u4e94\u5927\u652f\u67f1\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u76d1\u7ba1\u671f\u671b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u8861\u91cf\u7684\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u518d\u4fdd\u9669AI\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u57fa\u51c6\uff08RAIRAB\uff09\u5b9e\u65bd\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6cbb\u7406\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0fLLM\u662f\u5426\u6ee1\u8db3\u63a5\u5730\u3001\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u95ee\u8d23\u5236\u7684\u5ba1\u614e\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e2d\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u914d\u7f6e\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u63a5\u5730\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff080.90\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6f02\u79fb\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7ea640%\uff0c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u51e0\u4e4e\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e00\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5ba1\u614e\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u6709\u660e\u786e\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u3001\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5c31\u5df2\u7ecf\u80fd\u591f\u6ee1\u8db3\u53ef\u9760AI\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u3002"}}

Although RF is primarily based on probability flow Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE), recent studies have shown that injecting noise through reverse-time Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) for sampling can achieve superior generative performance. Inspired by Positive-incentive Noise ($\u03c0$-noise), we propose an innovative generative algorithm to train $\u03c0$-noise generators, namely Rectified Noise ($\u0394$RN), which improves the generative performance by injecting $\u03c0$-noise into the velocity field of pre-trained RF models. After introducing the Rectified Noise pipeline, pre-trained RF models can be efficiently transformed into $\u03c0$-noise generators.

We show that in-context learning can transform structured feedback into gradient-like directional information, enabling targeted edits. Unlike prior approaches that collapse judgments into single bits, our evaluators pair each comparison with textual feedback, which functions as high-bandwidth supervision. The iteration loop is done purely at inference time, without modifying any model weights, and is task-agnostic. We evaluate Feedback Descent on three diverse domains and find that it outperforms state-of-the-art prompt optimization (GEPA), reinforcement learning methods (GRPO, REINVENT), and even specialized graph-based molecular optimizers.

To compensate for the limited context, we leverage a pretrained Amodal Completion (AC) model to generate structure-aware candidates that serve as semantic priors for the missing regions. We introduce Context-Semantic Fusion Network (CSF-Net), a transformer-based fusion framework that fuses these candidates with contextual features to produce a semantic guidance image for image inpainting. This guidance improves inpainting quality by promoting structural accuracy and semantic consistency. CSF-Net can be seamlessly integrated into existing inpainting models without architectural changes and consistently enhances performance across diverse masking conditions. Extensive experiments on the Places365 and COCOA datasets demonstrate that CSF-Net effectively reduces object hallucination while enhancing visual realism and semantic alignment.

Previous work for LLM agents typically relies on elaborate prompt engineering or fine-tuning with expert trajectories to improve performance. In this work, we take a different perspective: we explore constructing process reward models (PRMs) to evaluate each decision and guide the agent's decision-making process. Unlike LLM reasoning, where each step is scored based on correctness, actions in agent tasks do not have a clear-cut correctness. Instead, they should be evaluated based on their proximity to the goal and the progress they have made. Building on this insight, we propose a re-defined PRM for agent tasks, named AgentPRM, to capture both the interdependence between sequential decisions and their contribution to the final goal. This enables better progress tracking and exploration-exploitation balance. To scalably obtain labeled data for training AgentPRM, we employ a Temporal Difference-based (TD-based) estimation method combined with Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE), which proves more sample-efficient than prior methods. Extensive experiments across different agentic tasks show that AgentPRM is over $8\\times$ more compute-efficient than baselines, and it demonstrates robust improvement when scaling up test-time compute. Moreover, we perform detailed analyses to show how our method works and offer more insights, e.g., applying AgentPRM to the reinforcement learning of LLM agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08PRM\uff09\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6307\u5bfc\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u6216\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f68\u8ff9\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4f46LLM\u5728\u9700\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u73af\u5883\u53cd\u9988\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u667a\u80fd\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u7f51\u7edc\u8d2d\u7269\u3001\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u5bfc\u822a\uff09\u4e2d\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08PRM\uff09\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3aAgentPRM\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u51b3\u7b56\u3002AgentPRM\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u5e8f\u8d2f\u51b3\u7b56\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6700\u7ec8\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8fdb\u5ea6\u5e76\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5730\u83b7\u53d6\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3AgentPRM\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5206\uff08TD\uff09\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5e7f\u4e49\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08GAE\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAgentPRM\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e868\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5c06AgentPRM\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "AgentPRM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bcf\u4e2a\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6765\u6307\u5bfcLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Explainable Artificial Intelligence offers a solution by providing insights into model decision-making and identifying the most relevant features for classification. In this paper, we investigate the impact of feature reduction using XAI techniques on the quality classification of injection-molded parts. We apply SHAP, Grad-CAM, and LIME to analyze feature importance in a Long Short-Term Memory model trained on real production data. By reducing the original 19 input features to 9 and 6, we evaluate the trade-off between model accuracy, inference speed, and interpretability. Our results show that reducing features can improve generalization while maintaining high classification performance, with an small increase in inference speed.

However, applying RL to open-domain tasks faces two key challenges: (1) the inherent subjectivity of these tasks prevents the verifiable rewards as required by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR); (2) Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) relies on external reward mechanisms. To overcome these limitations, we propose Self-Examining Reinforcement Learning (SERL), a novel self-improving framework where the LLM serves as both Actor and Judge. SERL introduces two synergistic reward mechanisms without any external signals. On the one hand, to improve the Actor's capability, we derive rewards from Copeland-style pairwise comparison judgments across a group of generated responses. On the other hand, a self-consistency reward that encourages coherent judgments is proposed to improve the Judge's reliability.

Traditional weed management methods, primarily relying on chemical herbicides, risk environmental contamination and lead to the emergence of herbicide-resistant species. Precision weeding, leveraging computer vision and machine learning methods, offers a promising eco-friendly alternative but is often limited by reliance on high-power computational platforms. This work presents an optimized, low-power edge AI system for weeds detection based on the YOLOv8n object detector deployed on the STM32U575ZI microcontroller. Several compression techniques are applied to the detection model, including structured pruning, integer quantization and input image resolution scaling in order to meet strict hardware constraints. The model is trained and evaluated on the CropAndWeed dataset with 74 plant species, achieving a balanced trade-off between detection accuracy and efficiency. Our system supports real-time, in-situ weeds detection with a minimal energy consumption of 51.8mJ per inference, enabling scalable deployment in power-constrained agricultural environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728STM32U575ZI\u5fae\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u7ecf\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u7684YOLOv8n\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u519c\u7530\u6742\u8349\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u4ec5\u4e3a\u6bcf\u6b21\u63a8\u740651.8mJ\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5e94\u5bf9\u5316\u5b66\u9664\u8349\u5242\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u73af\u5883\u6c61\u67d3\u548c\u6297\u836f\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f20\u7edf\u7cbe\u786e\u9664\u8349\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u9ad8\u529f\u7387\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6742\u8349\u68c0\u6d4b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5728STM32U575ZI\u5fae\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72YOLOv8n\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u3001\u6574\u6570\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7f29\u653e\u7b49\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\u3002\u5728CropAndWeed\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u5728STM32U575ZI\u5fae\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u6742\u8349\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u4f4e\u81f3\u6bcf\u6b21\u63a8\u740651.8mJ\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u630174\u79cd\u690d\u7269\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u6ee1\u8db3\u5728\u7535\u529b\u9650\u5236\u7684\u519c\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6742\u8349\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u539f\u4f4d\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u519c\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) provide feedback after generating the final answers but fail to evaluate the process for multi-step reasoning. Traditional Process Reward Models (PRMs) evaluate the reasoning process but require costly human annotations or rollout generation. While implicit PRM is trained only with outcome signals and derives step rewards through reward parameterization without explicit annotations, it is more suitable for multi-step reasoning in MHQA tasks. However, existing implicit PRM has only been explored for plain text scenarios. When adapting to MHQA tasks, it cannot handle the graph structure constraints in KGs and capture the potential inconsistency between CoT and KG paths. To address these limitations, we propose the DPRM (Dual Implicit Process Reward Model). It trains two implicit PRMs for CoT and KG reasoning in MHQA tasks. Both PRMs, namely KG-PRM and CoT-PRM, derive step-level rewards from outcome signals via reward parameterization without additional explicit annotations. Among them, KG-PRM uses preference pairs to learn structural constraints from KGs. DPRM further introduces a consistency constraint between CoT and KG reasoning steps, making the two PRMs mutually verify and collaboratively optimize the reasoning paths. We also provide a theoretical demonstration of the derivation of process rewards.

However, data acquisition remains a major challenge as it is both time-consuming and costly. Synthetic data offers a promising solution to augment insufficient data sets and improve the robustness of machine learning models. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of incorporating synthetic data into the training process of the injection molding process using an existing Long Short-Term Memory architecture. Our approach is to generate synthetic data by simulating production cycles and incorporating them into the training data set. Through iterative experimentation with different proportions of synthetic data, we attempt to find an optimal balance that maximizes the benefits of synthetic data while preserving the authenticity and relevance of real data. Our results suggest that the inclusion of synthetic data improves the model's ability to handle different scenarios, with potential practical industrial applications to reduce manual labor, machine use, and material waste. This approach provides a valuable alternative for situations where extensive data collection and maintenance has been impractical or costly and thus could contribute to more efficient manufacturing processes in the future.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6ce8\u5851\u6210\u578b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5de5\u4e1a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u4e14\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6269\u5145\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff08LSTM\uff09\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u751f\u4ea7\u5468\u671f\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6574\u5408\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u6ce8\u5851\u6210\u578b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u627e\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u8861\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u6750\u6599\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u4e0d\u4fbf\u6216\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5236\u9020\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

To address this problem, we propose SharpV, a minimalist and efficient method for adaptive pruning of visual tokens and KV cache. Different from most uniform compression approaches, SharpV dynamically adjusts pruning ratios based on spatial-temporal information. Remarkably, this adaptive mechanism occasionally achieves performance gains over dense models, offering a novel paradigm for adaptive pruning. During the KV cache pruning stage, based on observations of visual information degradation, SharpV prunes degraded visual features via a self-calibration manner, guided by similarity to original visual features. In this way, SharpV achieves hierarchical cache pruning from the perspective of information bottleneck, offering a new insight into VideoLLMs' information flow. Experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of SharpV.

Speech-based assessments show promise for early detection, as phonetic motor planning deficits alter acoustic features (e.g., pitch, tone), while memory and language impairments lead to syntactic and semantic errors. However, conventional speech-processing pipelines with hand-crafted features or general-purpose audio classifiers often exhibit limited performance and generalizability. To address these limitations, we introduce SpeechCARE, a multimodal speech processing pipeline that leverages pretrained, multilingual acoustic and linguistic transformer models to capture subtle speech-related cues associated with cognitive impairment. Inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm, SpeechCARE employs a dynamic fusion architecture that weights transformer-based acoustic, linguistic, and demographic inputs, allowing integration of additional modalities (e.g., social factors, imaging) and enhancing robustness across diverse tasks. Its robust preprocessing includes automatic transcription, large language model (LLM)-based anomaly detection, and task identification. A SHAP-based explainability module and LLM reasoning highlight each modality's contribution to decision-making. SpeechCARE achieved AUC = 0.88 and F1 = 0.72 for classifying cognitively healthy, MCI, and AD individuals, with AUC = 0.90 and F1 = 0.62 for MCI detection. Bias analysis showed minimal disparities, except for adults over 80. Mitigation techniques included oversampling and weighted loss. Future work includes deployment in real-world care settings (e.g., VNS Health, Columbia ADRC) and EHR-integrated explainability for underrepresented populations in New York City.", "AI": {"tldr": "SpeechCARE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u97f3\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u58f0\u5b66\u548c\u8bed\u8a00Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u5931\u667a\u75c7\uff08ADRD\uff09\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u548cMCI\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u97f3\u7684ADRD\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u8ba4\u77e5\u8870\u9000\u3002", "method": "SpeechCARE\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u58f0\u5b66\u548c\u8bed\u8a00Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408MoE\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u878d\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5bf9\u8bed\u97f3\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u52a0\u6743\u878d\u5408\u3002\u8be5\u6d41\u7a0b\u8fd8\u5305\u62ec\u81ea\u52a8\u8f6c\u5f55\u3001LLM\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc6\u522b\u3001SHAP\u89e3\u91ca\u548cLLM\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "SpeechCARE\u5728\u533a\u5206\u8ba4\u77e5\u5065\u5eb7\u3001\u8f7b\u5ea6\u8ba4\u77e5\u969c\u788d\uff08MCI\uff09\u548cAD\u4e2a\u4f53\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u4e860.88\u7684AUC\u548c0.72\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5728MCI\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u4e860.90\u7684AUC\u548c0.62\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u3002\u504f\u89c1\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u966480\u5c81\u4ee5\u4e0a\u6210\u5e74\u4eba\u5916\uff0c\u5404\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u5f88\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "SpeechCARE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u97f3\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728ADRD\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u672a\u6765\u8ba1\u5212\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u62a4\u7406\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\uff08EHR\uff09\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

Inspired by avian memory consolidation, EAGLE synergistically integrates segmentation guided by an appearance-aware meta-learning memory (AMM), with tracking driven by a geometry-aware localization memory (GLM). This memory consolidation mechanism, through structured appearance and geometry memory banks, stores high-confidence retrieval samples, effectively supporting both long- and short-term modeling of target appearance variations. This enables precise contour delineation with robust spatial discrimination, leading to significantly improved retrieval accuracy.

However, standard IL methods implicitly assume that the environment dynamics remain fixed between training and deployment. In practice, this assumption rarely holds where modeling inaccuracies, real-world parameter variations, and adversarial perturbations can all induce shifts in transition dynamics, leading to severe performance degradation. We address this challenge through Balance Equation-based Distributionally Robust Offline Imitation Learning, a framework that learns robust policies solely from expert demonstrations collected under nominal dynamics, without requiring further environment interaction. We formulate the problem as a distributionally robust optimization over an uncertainty set of transition models, seeking a policy that minimizes the imitation loss under the worst-case transition distribution. Importantly, we show that this robust objective can be reformulated entirely in terms of the nominal data distribution, enabling tractable offline learning. Empirical evaluations on continuous-control benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves superior robustness and generalization compared to state-of-the-art offline IL baselines, particularly under perturbed or shifted environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e73\u8861\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u79bb\u7ebf\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u201d\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u79f0\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0b\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u8fdb\u884c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u516c\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u8f6c\u79fb\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u5408\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u9c81\u68d2\u76ee\u6807\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u5728\u6807\u79f0\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6270\u52a8\u6216\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53d1\u751f\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u5047\u8bbe\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u7684\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u662f\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u60c5\u51b5\u4e2d\u8fd9\u79cd\u5047\u8bbe\u5f88\u96be\u6210\u7acb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e73\u8861\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u79bb\u7ebf\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u516c\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u8f6c\u79fb\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u5408\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5bfb\u6c42\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6a21\u4eff\u635f\u5931\u3002\u5173\u952e\u5728\u4e8e\uff0c\u8be5\u9c81\u68d2\u76ee\u6807\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u5728\u6807\u79f0\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6270\u52a8\u6216\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e73\u8861\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u79bb\u7ebf\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u4ec5\u4ece\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u9c81\u68d2\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Road-Style Adversarial Creation Attack for Visual 3D Detection in Autonomous Driving", "comment": "Accepted by the AAAI 2026 (Main Track)", "summary": "Modern autonomous driving (AD) systems leverage 3D object detection to perceive foreground objects in 3D environments for subsequent prediction and planning. Visual 3D detection based on RGB cameras provides a cost-effective solution compared to the LiDAR paradigm. While achieving promising detection accuracy, current deep neural network-based models remain highly susceptible to adversarial examples. The underlying safety concerns motivate us to investigate realistic adversarial attacks in AD scenarios. Previous work has demonstrated the feasibility of placing adversarial posters on the road surface to induce hallucinations in the detector. However, the unnatural appearance of the posters makes them easily noticeable by humans, and their fixed content can be readily targeted and defended. To address these limitations, we propose the AdvRoad to generate diverse road-style adversarial posters. The adversaries have naturalistic appearances resembling the road surface while compromising the detector to perceive non-existent objects at the attack locations. We employ a two-stage approach, termed Road-Style Adversary Generation and Scenario-Associated Adaptation, to maximize the attack effectiveness on the input scene while ensuring the natural appearance of the poster, allowing the attack to be carried out stealthily without drawing human attention. Extensive experiments show that AdvRoad generalizes well to different detectors, scenes, and spoofing locations. Moreover, physical attacks further demonstrate the practical threats in real-world environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aAdvRoad\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u7684\u9053\u8def\u98ce\u683c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6d77\u62a5\uff0c\u4ee5\u653b\u51fb\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u76843D\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6d77\u62a5\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u76843D\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5916\u89c2\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u4eba\u7c7b\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e14\u653b\u51fb\u5185\u5bb9\u56fa\u5b9a\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u9632\u5fa1\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u66f4\u903c\u771f\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u9690\u853d\u6027\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "AdvRoad\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u81ea\u7136\u9053\u8def\u5916\u89c2\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6d77\u62a5\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u573a\u666f\u5173\u8054\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6d77\u62a5\u7684\u9690\u853d\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAdvRoad\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6d77\u62a5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u653b\u51fb\u591a\u79cd3D\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u573a\u666f\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u5b9e\u9645\u7269\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u4e5f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AdvRoad\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9053\u8def\u98ce\u683c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6d77\u62a5\uff0c\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u76843D\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6784\u6210\u5b9e\u9645\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5916\u89c2\u4e0d\u81ea\u7136\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u5185\u5bb9\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, existing methods typically assume that unlearning requests arrive all at once, whereas in practice they often arrive sequentially. We present the first systematic study of continual unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models and show that popular unlearning methods suffer from rapid utility collapse: after only a few requests, models forget retained knowledge and generate degraded images. We trace this failure to cumulative parameter drift from the pre-training weights and argue that regularization is crucial to addressing it. To this end, we study a suite of add-on regularizers that (1) mitigate drift and (2) remain compatible with existing unlearning methods. Beyond generic regularizers, we show that semantic awareness is essential for preserving concepts close to the unlearning target, and propose a gradient-projection method that constrains parameter drift orthogonal to their subspace. This substantially improves continual unlearning performance and is complementary to other regularizers for further gains. Taken together, our study establishes continual unlearning as a fundamental challenge in text-to-image generation and provides insights, baselines, and open directions for advancing safe and accountable generative AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8fde\u7eed\u9057\u5fd8\u8bf7\u6c42\u65f6\u4f1a\u9047\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u5feb\u901f\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u9057\u5fd8\u5df2\u4fdd\u7559\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u539f\u56e0\u4e3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6743\u91cd\u7d2f\u79ef\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u6f02\u79fb\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u53ef\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u53c2\u6570\u6f02\u79fb\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u53c2\u6570\u6f02\u79fb\u9650\u5236\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u76ee\u6807\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u9057\u5fd8\u8bf7\u6c42\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u5230\u8fbe\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u60c5\u51b5\u662f\u8bf7\u6c42\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u8fde\u7eed\u5230\u8fbe\u7684\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u53ef\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u53c2\u6570\u6f02\u79fb\u5e76\u517c\u5bb9\u73b0\u6709\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9644\u52a0\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u53c2\u6570\u6f02\u79fb\u7ea6\u675f\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u76ee\u6807\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8fde\u7eed\u9057\u5fd8\u8bf7\u6c42\u65f6\u4f1a\u906d\u9047\u6548\u7528\u5feb\u901f\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u9057\u5fd8\u5df2\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u6301\u7eed\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6301\u7eed\u9057\u5fd8\u662f\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u6311\u6218\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89c1\u89e3\u3001\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

This motivated Imaginary Supervised Object Detection (ISOD), where models train on synthetic images and test on real images. However, existing methods face three limitations: (1) synthetic datasets suffer from simplistic prompts, poor image quality, and weak supervision; (2) DETR-based detectors, due to their random query initialization, struggle with slow convergence and overfitting to synthetic patterns, hindering real-world generalization; (3) uniform denoising pressure promotes model overfitting to pseudo-label noise. We propose Cascade HQP-DETR to address these limitations. First, we introduce a high-quality data pipeline using LLaMA-3, Flux, and Grounding DINO to generate the FluxVOC and FluxCOCO datasets, advancing ISOD from weak to full supervision. Second, our High-Quality Proposal guided query encoding initializes object queries with image-specific priors from SAM-generated proposals and RoI-pooled features, accelerating convergence while steering the model to learn transferable features instead of overfitting to synthetic patterns. Third, our cascade denoising algorithm dynamically adjusts training weights through progressively increasing IoU thresholds across decoder layers, guiding the model to learn robust boundaries from reliable visual cues rather than overfitting to noisy labels.

This paper introduces TRACE (Trajectory-based Reward for Agent Collaboration Estimation), a novel reward signal derived from the geometric properties of a dialogue's embedding trajectory--a concept we term 'conversational geometry'. Our central finding is that a reward model trained only on these structural signals achieves a pairwise accuracy (68.20%) comparable to a powerful LLM baseline that analyzes the full transcript (70.04%). Furthermore, a hybrid model combining interaction dynamics with textual analysis achieves the highest performance (80.17%), demonstrating their complementary nature.

Existing ZO methods, which estimate gradients via finite differences using random perturbations, often suffer from high variance and suboptimal search directions. Our approach addresses these challenges by: (i) reformulating the problem of gradient preconditioning as that of adaptively estimating an anisotropic perturbation distribution for gradient estimation, (ii) capturing curvature through a low-rank block diagonal preconditioner using the framework of natural evolution strategies, and (iii) applying a REINFORCE leave-one-out (RLOO) gradient estimator to reduce variance. Experiments on standard LLM benchmarks show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art ZO methods by achieving higher accuracy and faster convergence, while cutting peak memory usage by up to 27.3% compared with MeZO-Adam.", "AI": {"tldr": "LOREN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u96f6\u9636\uff08ZO\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u611f\u77e5\u66f2\u7387\u6765\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709ZO\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\u5927\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u5411\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u96f6\u9636\uff08ZO\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u5927\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u5411\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\u3002", "method": "LOREN\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee5\u4e0b\u65b9\u5f0f\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u5c06\u68af\u5ea6\u9884\u5904\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u4f30\u8ba1\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u5757\u5bf9\u89d2\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6765\u6355\u6349\u66f2\u7387\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u5e94\u7528REINFORCE leave-one-out\uff08RLOO\uff09\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLOREN\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u7684LLM\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684ZO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5cf0\u503c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u6bd4MeZO-Adam\u4f4e\u4e8627.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "LOREN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u8282\u80fd\u7684\u5fae\u8c03LLM\u7684\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While unimodal detection methods have shown progress in identifying synthetic media, their inability to leverage cross-modal correlations and precisely localize forged segments limits their practicality against sophisticated, fine-grained manipulations. To address this, we introduce a multi-modal deepfake detection and localization framework based on a Feature Pyramid-Transformer (FPN-Transformer), addressing critical gaps in cross-modal generalization and temporal boundary regression. The proposed approach utilizes pre-trained self-supervised models (WavLM for audio, CLIP for video) to extract hierarchical temporal features. A multi-scale feature pyramid is constructed through R-TLM blocks with localized attention mechanisms, enabling joint analysis of cross-context temporal dependencies. The dual-branch prediction head simultaneously predicts forgery probabilities and refines temporal offsets of manipulated segments, achieving frame-level localization precision. We evaluate our approach on the test set of the IJCAI'25 DDL-AV benchmark, showing a good performance with a final score of 0.7535 for cross-modal deepfake detection and localization in challenging environments. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our approach and provide a novel way for generalized deepfake detection.

In particular, the impact of shortcut learning, where models rely on spurious correlations instead of capturing causal task-relevant features, has received limited attention. To address this gap, we conduct an in-depth study to assess how detectors are influenced by potential shortcuts based on textual features, which are most susceptible to manipulation by social bots. We design a series of shortcut scenarios by constructing spurious associations between user labels and superficial textual cues to evaluate model robustness. Results show that shifts in irrelevant feature distributions significantly degrade social bot detector performance, with an average relative accuracy drop of 32\\% in the baseline models. To tackle this challenge, we propose mitigation strategies based on large language models, leveraging counterfactual data augmentation. These methods mitigate the problem from data and model perspectives across three levels, including data distribution at both the individual user text and overall dataset levels, as well as the model's ability to extract causal information.

These data are often collected from online sources. This raises serious concerns about the protection of user data, as individuals may not have given consent for their data to be used in training. To address this concern, recent studies introduce the concept of unlearnable examples, i.e., data instances that appear natural but are intentionally altered to prevent models from effectively learning from them. While existing methods demonstrate empirical effectiveness, they typically rely on heuristic trials and lack formal guarantees. Besides, when unlearnable examples are mixed with clean data, as is often the case in practice, their unlearnability disappears. In this work, we propose a novel approach to constructing unlearnable examples by systematically maximising the Bayes error, a measurement of irreducible classification error.

Existing expressivity results are often tied to specific design choices and lack comprehensive empirical validation on large-scale data. This leaves a gap between theory and practice, preventing generalizable insights that exceed particular application domains. Here, we propose the Generalized-Distance Transformer (GDT), a GT architecture using standard attention that incorporates many advancements for GTs from recent years, and develop a fine-grained understanding of the GDT's representation power in terms of attention and PEs. Through extensive experiments, we identify design choices that consistently perform well across various applications, tasks, and model scales, demonstrating strong performance in a few-shot transfer setting without fine-tuning. Our evaluation covers over eight million graphs with roughly 270M tokens across diverse domains, including image-based object detection, molecular property prediction, code summarization, and out-of-distribution algorithmic reasoning.

While prior research has emphasized algorithmic performance and visual fidelity, the perceptual quality of 3DGS-rendered content, especially under varying reconstruction conditions, remains largely underexplored. In practice, factors such as viewpoint sparsity, limited training iterations, point downsampling, noise, and color distortions can significantly degrade visual quality, yet their perceptual impact has not been systematically studied. To bridge this gap, we present 3DGS-QA, the first subjective quality assessment dataset for 3DGS. It comprises 225 degraded reconstructions across 15 object types, enabling a controlled investigation of common distortion factors. Based on this dataset, we introduce a no-reference quality prediction model that directly operates on native 3D Gaussian primitives, without requiring rendered images or ground-truth references. Our model extracts spatial and photometric cues from the Gaussian representation to estimate perceived quality in a structure-aware manner. We further benchmark existing quality assessment methods, spanning both traditional and learning-based approaches. Experimental results show that our method consistently achieves superior performance, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness for 3DGS content evaluation.

Existing DFL frameworks are limited by their strictly sequential structure, referred to as sequential DFL (S-DFL). However, S-DFL fails to capture the bidirectional feedback between prediction and optimization in complex interaction scenarios. In view of this, we first time propose recursive decision-focused learning (R-DFL), a novel framework that introduces bidirectional feedback between downstream optimization and upstream prediction. We further extend two distinct differentiation methods: explicit unrolling via automatic differentiation and implicit differentiation based on fixed-point methods, to facilitate efficient gradient propagation in R-DFL. We rigorously prove that both methods achieve comparable gradient accuracy, with the implicit method offering superior computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including the newsvendor problem and the bipartite matching problem, demonstrate that R-DFL not only substantially enhances the final decision quality over sequential baselines but also exhibits robust adaptability across diverse scenarios in closed-loop decision-making problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9012\u5f52\u51b3\u7b56\u805a\u7126\u5b66\u4e60\uff08R-DFL\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u987a\u5e8f\u51b3\u7b56\u805a\u7126\u5b66\u4e60\uff08S-DFL\uff09\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u987a\u5e8f\u51b3\u7b56\u805a\u7126\u5b66\u4e60\uff08S-DFL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u53cd\u9988\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9012\u5f52\u51b3\u7b56\u805a\u7126\u5b66\u4e60\uff08R-DFL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e0b\u6e38\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u4e0a\u6e38\u9884\u6d4b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u53cd\u9988\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u68af\u5ea6\u4f20\u64ad\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5c55\u5f00\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u52a8\u70b9\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u5fae\u5206\u3002", "result": "R-DFL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5305\u62ecnewsvendor\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u4e8c\u5206\u56fe\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u987a\u5e8f\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cR-DFL\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6700\u7ec8\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5728\u95ed\u73af\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002\u9690\u5f0f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9012\u5f52\u51b3\u7b56\u805a\u7126\u5b66\u4e60\uff08R-DFL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u95ed\u73af\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Modern Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pre-trained on large-scale diverse datasets, exhibit remarkable world understanding capabilities that benefit for various vision tasks. Recent studies have demonstrated significant improvements in MDE through fine-tuning these VFMs. Inspired by these developments, we propose WEDepth, a novel approach that adapts VFMs for MDE without modi-fying their structures and pretrained weights, while effec-tively eliciting and leveraging their inherent priors.

These require gathering information from a large set of documents and reasoning over them. To address this gap, we propose S-RAG, an approach specifically designed for such queries. At ingestion time, S-RAG constructs a structured representation of the corpus; at inference time, it translates natural-language queries into formal queries over said representation. To validate our approach and promote further research in this area, we introduce two new datasets of aggregative queries: HOTELS and WORLD CUP.

Multi-agent systems offer a promising solution by combining the interpretability of LLMs with the precision of specialized models and tools.

However, existing approaches either rely on manually defined action spaces that lack scalability or utilize unstructured spaces that render exhaustive search computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named \\textsc{DynaAct} for automatically constructing a compact action space to enhance sequential reasoning in complex problem-solving scenarios. Our method first estimates a proxy for the complete action space by extracting general sketches observed in a corpus covering diverse complex reasoning problems using large language models. We then formulate a submodular function that jointly evaluates candidate actions based on their utility to the current state and their diversity, and employ a greedy algorithm to select an optimal candidate set. Extensive experiments on six diverse standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves overall performance, while maintaining efficient inference without introducing substantial latency.

A multi-level contrastive objective aligns textual and visual representations, promoting disentangled and interpretable expert styles. Across the LIDC-IDRI lung nodule and multi-institutional prostate MRI datasets, ProSona reduces the Generalized Energy Distance by 17% and improves mean Dice by more than one point compared with DPersona.

The gloss sequences of the spoken Bangla sentences are made up of individual glosses which are Bangla sign supported words and serve as an intermediate representation for a continuous sign. Our dataset consists of 1000 high quality Bangla sentences that are manually annotated into a gloss sequence by a professional signer. The augmentation process incorporates rule-based linguistic strategies and prompt engineering techniques that we have adopted by critically analyzing our human annotated sentence-gloss pairs and by working closely with our professional signer. Furthermore, we fine-tune several transformer-based models such as mBart50, Google mT5, GPT4.1-nano and evaluate their sentence-to-gloss translation performance using BLEU scores, based on these evaluation metrics we compare the model's gloss-translation consistency across our dataset and the RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u624b\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7814\u7a76\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u800c\u53d7\u963b\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b1000\u4e2a\u624b\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u53e5\u5bf9\u548c\u7ea63000\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u53e5\u5bf9\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5e73\u884c\u6570\u636e\u96c6Bangla-SGP\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bf9Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5904\u7406\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u624b\u8bed\uff08BdSL\uff09\u7ffb\u8bd1\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u4e00\u9879\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90NLP\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u8bcd\u548c\u5b57\u6bcd\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aBangla-SGP\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5e73\u884c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b1000\u4e2a\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u53e5\u5b50-\u624b\u8bed\u8bcd\u5e8f\u5217\u5bf9\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53e5\u6cd5\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u89c4\u5219\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u7ea63000\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u5bf9\u6765\u6269\u5145\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5bf9mBart50\u3001Google mT5\u548cGPT4.1-nano\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528BLEU\u5206\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u53e5\u5b50\u5230\u624b\u8bed\u8bcd\u5e8f\u5217\u7ffb\u8bd1\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u4f7f\u7528BLEU\u5206\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6240\u9009Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\u5230\u624b\u8bed\u8bcd\u5e8f\u5217\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u5728Bangla-SGP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cRWTH-PHOENIX-2014T\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u624b\u8bed\u8bcd\u5e8f\u5217\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Bangla-SGP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3a\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u624b\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u3001\u5305\u542b\u624b\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5e73\u884c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u624b\u8bedNLP\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

While von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions offer a theoretically grounded alternative on the sphere, their reliance on Bessel functions and rejection sampling hinders practical adoption. We propose \\textbf{Geometric Action Control (GAC)}, a novel action generation paradigm that preserves the geometric benefits of spherical distributions while \\textit{simplifying computation}. GAC decomposes action generation into a direction vector and a learnable concentration parameter, enabling efficient interpolation between deterministic actions and uniform spherical noise. This design reduces parameter count from \\(2d\\) to \\(d+1\\), and avoids the \\(O(dk)\\) complexity of vMF rejection sampling, achieving simple \\(O(d)\\) operations. Empirically, GAC consistently matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods across six MuJoCo benchmarks, achieving 37.6\\% improvement over SAC on Ant-v4 and the best results on 4 out of 6 tasks. Our ablation studies reveal that both \\textbf{spherical normalization} and \\textbf{adaptive concentration control} are essential to GAC's success. These findings suggest that robust and efficient continuous control does not require complex distributions, but a principled respect for the geometry of action spaces.

Assuming feature vectors are drawn i.i.d. from a fixed but unknown distribution, we measure the learner's regret against the linear predictor minimizing a notion of loss that combines the prediction error and payment. When the mapping between payments and noise covariance is known, we prove that the rate $\\sqrt{T}$ is optimal for regret if logarithmic factors are ignored. When the noise covariance is unknown, we show that the optimal regret rate becomes of order $T^{2/3}$ (ignoring log factors).

A common approach to localize objects across multiple sizes is to merge backbone features of different resolutions. Furthermore, to enable small object detection in densely populated regions, the input image is commonly upsampled and tiling is applied to cope with the increased computational and memory requirements. Because of these ad-hoc solutions, existing counters struggle with images containing diverse-sized objects and densely populated regions of small objects. We propose GECO2, an end-to-end few-shot counting and detection method that explicitly addresses the object scale issues. A new dense query representation gradually aggregates exemplar-specific feature information across scales that leads to high-resolution dense queries that enable detection of large as well as small objects. GECO2 surpasses state-of-the-art few-shot counters in counting as well as detection accuracy by 10% while running 3x times faster at smaller GPU memory footprint.", "AI": {"tldr": "GECO2\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8ba1\u6570\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u5730\u805a\u5408\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u8c61\u5c3a\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5927\u3001\u5c0f\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u8ba1\u6570\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u90fd\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fd0\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\uff0cGPU\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u8ba1\u6570\u5668\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5305\u542b\u5404\u79cd\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5bf9\u8c61\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bc6\u96c6\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u57df\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e90\u4e8e\u5b83\u4eec\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u5408\u5e76\u9aa8\u5e72\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u5206\u5757\u5904\u7406\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5bf9\u8c61\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGECO2\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8ba1\u6570\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u67e5\u8be2\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6e10\u8fdb\u5730\u805a\u5408\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u540c\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u5927\u548c\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "GECO2\u5728\u8ba1\u6570\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u6bd4\u76ee\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8ba1\u6570\u5668\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8610%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fd0\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e863\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5360\u7528\u7684GPU\u5185\u5b58\u66f4\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "GECO2\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8ba1\u6570\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u67e5\u8be2\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5bf9\u8c61\u5c3a\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u5927\u548c\u5c0f\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present \\textbf{AlphaResearch}, an autonomous research agent designed to discover new algorithms on open-ended problems. To synergize the feasibility and innovation of the discovery process, we construct a novel dual research environment by combining the execution-based verify and simulated real-world peer review environment. AlphaResearch discovers new algorithm by iteratively running the following steps: (1) propose new ideas (2) verify the ideas in the dual research environment (3) optimize the research proposals for better performance. To promote a transparent evaluation process, we construct \\textbf{AlphaResearchComp}, a new evaluation benchmark that includes an eight open-ended algorithmic problems competition, with each problem carefully curated and verified through executable pipelines, objective metrics, and reproducibility checks. AlphaResearch gets a 2/8 win rate in head-to-head comparison with human researchers, demonstrate the possibility of accelerating algorithm discovery with LLMs. Notably, the algorithm discovered by AlphaResearch on the \\emph{``packing circles''} problem achieves the best-of-known performance, surpassing the results of human researchers and strong baselines from recent work (e.g., AlphaEvolve).

These metrics fail to capture the quality of an agent's decisions, its operational autonomy, or its ultimate business value. This white paper proposes a novel, comprehensive framework of eleven outcome-based, task-agnostic performance metrics for AI agents that transcend domain boundaries. These metrics are designed to enable organizations to evaluate agents based on the quality of their decisions, their degree of autonomy, their adaptability to new challenges, and the tangible business value they deliver, regardless of the underlying model architecture or specific use case. We introduce metrics such as Goal Completion Rate (GCR), Autonomy Index (AIx), Multi-Step Task Resilience (MTR), and Business Impact Efficiency (BIE). Through a large-scale simulated experiment involving four distinct agent architectures (ReAct, Chain-of-Thought, Tool-Augmented, Hybrid) across five diverse domains (Healthcare, Finance, Marketing, Legal, and Customer Service), we demonstrate the framework's efficacy. Our results reveal significant performance trade-offs between different agent designs, highlighting the Hybrid Agent as the most consistently high-performing model across the majority of our proposed metrics, achieving an average Goal Completion Rate of 88.8\\% and the highest Return on Investment (ROI).

IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence (2024)", "summary": "The integration of different learning paradigms has long been a focus of machine learning research, aimed at overcoming the inherent limitations of individual methods. Fuzzy rule-based models excel in interpretability and have seen widespread application across diverse fields. However, they face challenges such as complex design specifications and scalability issues with large datasets. The fusion of different techniques and strategies, particularly Gradient Boosting, with Fuzzy Rule-Based Models offers a robust solution to these challenges. This paper proposes an Integrated Fusion Framework that merges the strengths of both paradigms to enhance model performance and interpretability. At each iteration, a Fuzzy Rule-Based Model is constructed and controlled by a dynamic factor to optimize its contribution to the overall ensemble. This control factor serves multiple purposes: it prevents model dominance, encourages diversity, acts as a regularization parameter, and provides a mechanism for dynamic tuning based on model performance, thus mitigating the risk of overfitting. Additionally, the framework incorporates a sample-based correction mechanism that allows for adaptive adjustments based on feedback from a validation set. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of the presented gradient boosting framework for fuzzy rule-based models, demonstrating performance enhancement, especially in terms of mitigating overfitting and complexity typically associated with many rules. By leveraging an optimal factor to govern the contribution of each model, the framework improves performance, maintains interpretability, and simplifies the maintenance and update of the models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u7cca\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u56e0\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u7cca\u6a21\u578b\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3001\u9f13\u52b1\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ed3\u5408\u6837\u672c\u4fee\u6b63\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u514b\u670d\u5355\u4e00\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u6a21\u7cca\u89c4\u5219\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u6280\u672f\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u56e0\u5b50\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u7cca\u89c4\u5219\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u8be5\u56e0\u5b50\u7528\u4e8e\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3001\u9f13\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6837\u672c\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u89c4\u5219\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u51cf\u8f7b\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u56e0\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u89c4\u5219\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u56e0\u5b50\u548c\u6837\u672c\u4fee\u6b63\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To facilitate large-scale training, we introduce a two-stage Distilled Data Curation Framework: the first stage leverages data restoration and VLM-based filtering to create a compact, high-quality seed dataset from diverse sources; the second stage utilizes these curated examples for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, thus scaling the generation capability across various subjects and contexts.

Beyond improving abilities, these detailed reasoning traces also create a new opportunity for AI safety, CoT Monitorability: monitoring potential model misbehavior, such as the use of shortcuts or sycophancy, through their chain-of-thought (CoT) during decision-making. However, two key fundamental challenges arise when attempting to build more effective monitors through CoT analysis. First, as prior research on CoT faithfulness has pointed out, models do not always truthfully represent their internal decision-making in the generated reasoning. Second, monitors themselves may be either overly sensitive or insufficiently sensitive, and can potentially be deceived by models' long, elaborate reasoning traces. In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of the challenges and potential of CoT monitorability. Motivated by two fundamental challenges we mentioned before, we structure our study around two central perspectives: (i) verbalization: to what extent do LRMs faithfully verbalize the true factors guiding their decisions in the CoT, and (ii) monitor reliability: to what extent can misbehavior be reliably detected by a CoT-based monitor? Specifically, we provide empirical evidence and correlation analyses between verbalization quality, monitor reliability, and LLM performance across mathematical, scientific, and ethical domains. Then we further investigate how different CoT intervention methods, designed to improve reasoning efficiency or performance, will affect monitoring effectiveness. Finally, we propose MoME, a new paradigm in which LLMs monitor other models' misbehavior through their CoT and provide structured judgments along with supporting evidence.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

To address these challenges, task-vector-based methods have been explored by inserting compact representations of many-shot in-context demonstrations into model activations. However, existing task-vector-based methods either overlook the importance of where to insert task vectors or struggle to determine suitable values for each location. To this end, we propose a novel Sensitivity-aware Task Vector insertion framework (STV) to figure out where and what to insert. Our key insight is that activation deltas across query-context pairs exhibit consistent structural patterns, providing a reliable cue for insertion. Based on the identified sensitive-aware locations, we construct a pre-clustered activation bank for each location by clustering the activation values, and then apply reinforcement learning to choose the most suitable one to insert.

The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated on large-scale benchmarks. An SNN trained on the generated I2E-ImageNet dataset achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 60.50%. Critically, this work establishes a powerful sim-to-real paradigm where pre-training on synthetic I2E data and fine-tuning on the real-world CIFAR10-DVS dataset yields an unprecedented accuracy of 92.5%.

Most existing GraphRAG efforts focus on Resource Description Framework (RDF) knowledge graphs, relying on triple representations and SPARQL queries. However, the potential of Cypher and Labeled Property Graph (LPG) databases to serve as scalable and effective reasoning engines within GraphRAG pipelines remains underexplored in current research literature. To fill this gap, we propose Multi-Agent GraphRAG, a modular LLM agentic system for text-to-Cypher query generation serving as a natural language interface to LPG-based graph data. Our proof-of-concept system features an LLM-based workflow for automated Cypher queries generation and execution, using Memgraph as the graph database backend. Iterative content-aware correction and normalization, reinforced by an aggregated feedback loop, ensures both semantic and syntactic refinement of generated queries. We evaluate our system on the CypherBench graph dataset covering several general domains with diverse types of queries. In addition, we demonstrate performance of the proposed workflow on a property graph derived from the IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) data, representing a digital twin of a building.

To address the difficulty of mapping AI algorithms to hardware, recent work proposes C++ embedded and PyTorch-inspired domain-specific languages like ThunderKittens (TK) to simplify high performance AI kernel development on NVIDIA hardware. We explore the extent to which such primitives -- for explicit tile-based programming with optimized memory accesses and fine-grained asynchronous execution across workers -- are NVIDIA-specific or general. We provide the first detailed study of the programming primitives that lead to performant AMD AI kernels, and we encapsulate these insights in the HipKittens (HK) programming framework. We find that tile-based abstractions used in prior DSLs generalize to AMD GPUs, however we need to rethink the algorithms that instantiate these abstractions for AMD. We validate the HK primitives across CDNA3 and CDNA4 AMD platforms. In evaluations, HK kernels compete with AMD's hand-optimized assembly kernels for GEMMs and attention, and consistently outperform compiler baselines. Moreover, assembly is difficult to scale to the breadth of AI workloads; reflecting this, in some settings HK outperforms all available kernel baselines by $1.2-2.4\\times$ (e.g., $d=64$ attention, GQA backwards, memory-bound kernels). These findings help pave the way for a single, tile-based software layer for high-performance AI kernels that translates across GPU vendors.

In this work, we investigate the moral response of LLMs to persona role-play, prompting a LLM to assume a specific character. Using the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ), we introduce a benchmark that quantifies two properties: moral susceptibility and moral robustness, defined from the variability of MFQ scores across and within personas, respectively. We find that, for moral robustness, model family accounts for most of the variance, while model size shows no systematic effect. The Claude family is, by a significant margin, the most robust, followed by Gemini and GPT-4 models, with other families exhibiting lower robustness. In contrast, moral susceptibility exhibits a mild family effect but a clear within-family size effect, with larger variants being more susceptible. Moreover, robustness and susceptibility are positively correlated, an association that is more pronounced at the family level. Additionally, we present moral foundation profiles for models without persona role-play and for personas averaged across models. Together, these analyses provide a systematic view of how persona conditioning shapes moral behavior in large language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u5728\u626e\u6f14\u4e0d\u540c\u89d2\u8272\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u9053\u5fb7\u5224\u65ad\u4f1a\u53d1\u751f\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u901a\u8fc7MFQ\u95ee\u5377\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u201c\u9053\u5fb7\u6613\u611f\u6027\u201d\u548c\u201c\u9053\u5fb7\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u201d\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cClaude\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9053\u5fb7\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u800cGPT\u548cGemini\u7cfb\u5217\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002\u9053\u5fb7\u6613\u611f\u6027\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u8d8a\u5927\u8d8a\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u548c\u6613\u611f\u6027\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLMs\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u793e\u4ea4\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5b83\u4eec\u5982\u4f55\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u8f6c\u53d8\u9053\u5fb7\u5224\u65ad\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9053\u5fb7\u57fa\u7840\u95ee\u5377\uff08MFQ\uff09\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cf\u5316\u201c\u9053\u5fb7\u6613\u611f\u6027\u201d\u548c\u201c\u9053\u5fb7\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u201d\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u4ece\u8de8\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u5185\u7684MFQ\u5206\u6570\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u6765\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u5217\u5bf9\u9053\u5fb7\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5927\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002Claude\u7cfb\u5217\u6700\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u662fGemini\u548cGPT-4\u3002\u9053\u5fb7\u6613\u611f\u6027\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u5927\u8d8a\u6613\u611f\u3002\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u548c\u6613\u611f\u6027\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u5217\u5c42\u9762\u66f4\u660e\u663e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u626e\u6f14\u4e0d\u540c\u89d2\u8272\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u9053\u5fb7\u5224\u65ad\u4f1a\u53d1\u751f\u53d8\u5316\u3002Claude\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9053\u5fb7\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u5bb6\u65cf\u5bf9\u9053\u5fb7\u6613\u611f\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

However, the extent to which these models have a semantic understanding of the images they generate is not well understood. In this work, we investigate whether the internal representations used by these models during text-to-image generation contain semantic information that is meaningful to humans. To do so, we perform probing on Stable Diffusion with simple regression layers that predict semantic attributes for objects and evaluate these predictions against human annotations. Surprisingly, we find that this success can actually be attributed to the text encoding occurring in CLIP rather than the reverse diffusion process. We demonstrate that groups of specific semantic attributes have markedly different decoding accuracy than the average, and are thus represented to different degrees. Finally, we show that attributes become more difficult to disambiguate from one another during the inverse diffusion process, further demonstrating the strongest semantic representation of object attributes in CLIP. We conclude that the separately trained CLIP vision-language model is what determines the human-like semantic representation, and that the diffusion process instead takes the role of a visual decoder.", "AI": {"tldr": "Stable Diffusion\u5728\u6587\u751f\u56fe\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u6d4bStable Diffusion\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u6e90\u4e8eCLIP\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u9006\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u4e49\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u9006\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5c5e\u6027\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bc1\u660eCLIP\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u5f81\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\uff0cCLIP\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4eba\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u800c\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5219\u626e\u6f14\u89c6\u89c9\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76Stable Diffusion\u7b49\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u662f\u5426\u5305\u542b\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8be5\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u7531\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u54ea\u4e2a\u90e8\u5206\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u56de\u5f52\u5c42\u5bf9Stable Diffusion\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u63a2\u6d4b\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u7269\u4f53\u548c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5730\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86CLIP\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u5f81\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cStable Diffusion\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u7684\u6210\u529f\u4e3b\u8981\u5f52\u529f\u4e8eCLIP\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u9006\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u4e49\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u5728\u9006\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u5c5e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "CLIP\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u662f\u51b3\u5b9a\u7c7b\u4eba\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u800c\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5219\u4e3b\u8981\u8d1f\u8d23\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u89e3\u7801\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u56fe\u50cf\u3002"}}

Prior work proposes recurrent transformers, which allocate a fixed number of extra iterations per token to improve generation quality. After the first, standard forward pass, instead of verbalization, last-layer hidden states are fed back as inputs for additional iterations to refine token predictions. Yet we identify a latent overthinking phenomenon: easy token predictions that are already correct after the first pass are sometimes revised into errors in additional iterations. To address this, we propose Think-at-Hard (TaH), a dynamic latent thinking method that iterates deeper only at hard tokens. It employs a lightweight neural decider to trigger latent iterations only at tokens that are likely incorrect after the standard forward pass. During latent iterations, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules shift the LLM objective from general next-token prediction to focused hard-token refinement. We further introduce a duo-causal attention mechanism that extends attention from the token sequence dimension to an additional iteration depth dimension. This enables cross-iteration information flow while maintaining full sequential parallelism. Experiments show that TaH boosts LLM reasoning performance across five challenging benchmarks while maintaining the same parameter count. Compared with baselines that iterate twice for all output tokens, TaH delivers 8.1-11.3% accuracy gains while exempting 94% of tokens from the second iteration. Against strong single-iteration Qwen3 models finetuned with the same data, it also delivers 4.0-5.0% accuracy gains. When allowing less than 3% additional parameters from LoRA and the iteration decider, the gains increase to 8.5-12.6% and 5.3-5.4%, respectively.

In this work, we introduce the Complex-Valued Stuart-Landau Graph Neural Network (SLGNN), a novel architecture grounded in Stuart-Landau oscillator dynamics. Stuart-Landau oscillators are canonical models of limit-cycle behavior near Hopf bifurcations, which are fundamental to synchronization theory and are widely used in e.g. neuroscience for mesoscopic brain modeling. Unlike harmonic oscillators and phase-only Kuramoto models, Stuart-Landau oscillators retain both amplitude and phase dynamics, enabling rich phenomena such as amplitude regulation and multistable synchronization. The proposed SLGNN generalizes existing phase-centric Kuramoto-based OGNNs by allowing node feature amplitudes to evolve dynamically according to Stuart-Landau dynamics, with explicit tunable hyperparameters (such as the Hopf-parameter and the coupling strength) providing additional control over the interplay between feature amplitudes and network structure. We conduct extensive experiments across node classification, graph classification, and graph regression tasks, demonstrating that SLGNN outperforms existing OGNNs and establishes a novel, expressive, and theoretically grounded framework for deep oscillatory architectures on graphs.", "AI": {"tldr": "OGNNs\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u6df1\u5ea6GNNs\u4e2d\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b0\u5174\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u503cStuart-Landau GNN (SLGNN)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eStuart-Landau\u632f\u8361\u5668\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3002SLGNN\u901a\u8fc7\u5141\u8bb8\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u5e45\u5ea6\u6839\u636eStuart-Landau\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u660e\u786e\u53ef\u8c03\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u6765\u63a8\u5e7f\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4ee5\u76f8\u4f4d\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684Kuramoto GNN\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSLGNN\u5728\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u56fe\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709OGNNs\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709GNNs\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u5904\u7406\u3002Stuart-Landau\u632f\u8361\u5668\u56e0\u5176\u5728\u632f\u52a8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u800c\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSLGNN\u7684\u65b0\u578bGNN\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b83\u57fa\u4e8eStuart-Landau\u632f\u8361\u5668\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5141\u8bb8\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u5e45\u5ea6\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86Hopf\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8026\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7b49\u53ef\u8c03\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u7279\u5f81\u5e45\u5ea6\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u56fe\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cSLGNN\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684OGNNs\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SLGNN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u3001\u6709\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u4e14\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u56fe\u6df1\u5ea6\u632f\u8361\u67b6\u6784\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709GNNs\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing metrics rely on global embeddings or coarse VLM prompting, failing to capture fine-grained identity changes and providing limited diagnostic insight. We introduce Beyond the Pixels, a hierarchical evaluation framework that decomposes identity assessment into feature-level transformations. Our approach guides VLMs through structured reasoning by (1) hierarchically decomposing subjects into (type, style) -> attribute -> feature decision tree, and (2) prompting for concrete transformations rather than abstract similarity scores. This decomposition grounds VLM analysis in verifiable visual evidence, reducing hallucinations and improving consistency. We validate our framework across four state-of-the-art generative models, demonstrating strong alignment with human judgments in measuring identity consistency. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark specifically designed to stress-test generative models. It comprises 1,078 image-prompt pairs spanning diverse subject types, including underrepresented categories such as anthropomorphic and animated characters, and captures an average of six to seven transformation axes per prompt.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201cBeyond the Pixels\u201d\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8eab\u4efd\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5bfc\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u5c40\u5d4c\u5165\u6216\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u5d4c\u5165\u6216\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6VLM\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u5fae\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e5f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bca\u65ad\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201cBeyond the Pixels\u201d\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\uff081\uff09\u5c06\u4e3b\u4f53\u5206\u5c42\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\uff08\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u98ce\u683c\uff09->\u5c5e\u6027->\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\uff082\uff09\u63d0\u793aVLM\u8fdb\u884c\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u6765\u6307\u5bfcVLM\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e8\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u56db\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u540e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u8861\u91cf\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b1,078\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf-\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u4e3b\u4f53\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u548c\u52a8\u753b\u89d2\u8272\uff09\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\u5305\u542b\u516d\u5230\u4e03\u4e2a\u8f6c\u6362\u8f74\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u201cBeyond the Pixels\u201d\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8eab\u4efd\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8eab\u4efd\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u65b0\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u4e5f\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Are they better able to describe themselves than other models? We study the extent to which LMs' privileged access to their own internals can be leveraged to produce new techniques for explaining their behavior. Using existing interpretability techniques as a source of ground truth, we fine-tune LMs to generate natural language descriptions of (1) the information encoded by LM features, (2) the causal structure of LMs' internal activations, and (3) the influence of specific input tokens on LM outputs. When trained with only tens of thousands of example explanations, explainer models exhibit non-trivial generalization to new queries. This generalization appears partly attributable to explainer models' privileged access to their own internals: using a model to explain its own computations generally works better than using a *different* model to explain its computations (even if the other model is significantly more capable).

JobSphere employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, and it is multilingual, available in English, Hindi and Punjabi. JobSphere technique uses 4-bit quantization, allowing the platform to deploy on consumer-grade GPUs (i.e., NVIDIA RTX 3050 4GB), making the implementation 89% cheaper than that of cloud-based systems. Key innovations include voice-enabled interaction with the assistant, automated mock tests, resume parsing with skills recognition, and embed-based job recommendation that achieves a precision@10 score of 68%. An evaluation of JobSphere's implementation reveals 94% factual accuracy, a median response time of 1.8 seconds, and a System Usability Scale score of 78.5/100, a 50% improvement compared to the baseline PGRKAM platform context. In conclusion, JobSphere effectively fills significant accessibility gaps for Punjab/Hindi-speaking users in rural locations, while also affirming the users access to trusted job content provided by government agencies.", "AI": {"tldr": "JobSphere\u662f\u4e00\u4e2aAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u804c\u4e1a\u52a9\u624b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RAG\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u652f\u6301\uff08\u82f1\u8bed\u3001\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u3001\u65c1\u906e\u666e\u8bed\uff09\u30014\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\uff08\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\uff09\u3001\u8bed\u97f3\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u6a21\u62df\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u7b80\u5386\u89e3\u6790\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u804c\u4f4d\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u653f\u5e9c\u5c31\u4e1a\u7f51\u7ad9\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7528\u6237\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u653f\u5e9c\u5c31\u4e1a\u7f51\u7ad9\u65f6\uff0c\u666e\u904d\u9762\u4e34\u5bfc\u822a\u590d\u6742\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u9009\u9879\u5c11\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u652f\u6301\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "JobSphere\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u82f1\u8bed\u3001\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u548c\u65c1\u906e\u666e\u8bed\u3002\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528\u4e864\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7GPU\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u90e8\u7f72\u6210\u672c\u6bd4\u4e91\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f4e89%\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u529f\u80fd\u5305\u62ec\u8bed\u97f3\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u6a21\u62df\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u7b80\u5386\u89e3\u6790\uff08\u542b\u6280\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u804c\u4f4d\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "result": "JobSphere\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8694%\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e2d\u4f4d\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a1.8\u79d2\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u91cf\u8868\uff08SUS\uff09\u5f97\u5206\u4e3a78.5/100\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7684PGRKAM\u5e73\u53f0\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8650%\u3002\u804c\u4f4d\u63a8\u8350\u7684precision@10\u5f97\u5206\u4e3a68%\u3002", "conclusion": "JobSphere\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u65c1\u906e\u666e/\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u5730\u533a\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u519c\u6751\u5730\u533a\uff09\u7528\u6237\u7684\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u7528\u6237\u80fd\u591f\u83b7\u53d6\u653f\u5e9c\u673a\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5c31\u4e1a\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

Current assessments often measure only short-term experimental resource usage and disproportionately emphasize batch learning settings, failing to reflect real-world, long-term AI lifecycles. In this work, we propose a comprehensive evaluation protocol for assessing the long-term sustainability of ML models, applicable to both batch and streaming learning scenarios. Through experiments on diverse classification tasks using a range of model types, we demonstrate that traditional static train-test evaluations do not reliably capture sustainability under evolving data and repeated model updates. Our results show that long-term sustainability varies significantly across models, and in many cases, higher environmental cost yields little performance benefit.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684AI\u76d1\u7ba1\u548c\u62a5\u544a\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u957f\u671f\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8eAI\u7684\u957f\u671f\u90e8\u7f72\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u671f\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684AI\u76d1\u7ba1\u548c\u62a5\u544a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c4\u7a0b\u6765\u8861\u91cfAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u77ed\u671f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u6279\u5904\u7406\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u957f\u671fAI\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6279\u5904\u7406\u548c\u6d41\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u9759\u6001\u8bad\u7ec3-\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6570\u636e\u548c\u91cd\u590d\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u957f\u671f\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9ad8\u73af\u5883\u6210\u672c\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u9759\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u8861\u91cfAI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u957f\u671f\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8\u5728\u73af\u5883\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

To develop and evaluate effective morphing attack detection (MAD) systems, we need access to high-quality, realistic morphed images that reflect the challenges posed in real-world scenarios. However, existing morph generation methods often produce images that are blurry, riddled with artifacts, or poorly constructed making them easy to detect and not representative of the most dangerous attacks. In this work, we introduce StableMorph, a novel approach that generates highly realistic, artifact-free morphed face images using modern diffusion-based image synthesis. Unlike prior methods, StableMorph produces full-head images with sharp details, avoids common visual flaws, and offers unmatched control over visual attributes. Through extensive evaluation, we show that StableMorph images not only rival or exceed the quality of genuine face images but also maintain a strong ability to fool face recognition systems posing a greater challenge to existing MAD solutions and setting a new standard for morph quality in research and operational testing. StableMorph improves the evaluation of biometric security by creating more realistic and effective attacks and supports the development of more robust detection systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "StableMorph\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5ea6\u903c\u771f\u3001\u65e0\u4f2a\u5f71\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u878d\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u9762\u90e8\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u878d\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u53ef\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u8138\u56fe\u50cf\u5ab2\u7f8e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6b3a\u9a97\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u878d\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u4f2a\u5f71\u591a\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u4ee3\u8868\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u6700\u5177\u5a01\u80c1\u6027\u7684\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u5f3a\u7684\u878d\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u878d\u5408\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStableMorph\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5ea6\u903c\u771f\u3001\u65e0\u4f2a\u5f71\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u878d\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u5305\u542b\u5b8c\u6574\u5934\u90e8\u3001\u7ec6\u8282\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "StableMorph\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u878d\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u53ef\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u8138\u56fe\u50cf\u5ab2\u7f8e\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u8138\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56fe\u50cf\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6b3a\u9a97\u9762\u90e8\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u878d\u5408\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u878d\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u4e3a\u9762\u90e8\u8bc6\u522b\u5b89\u5168\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "StableMorph\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u5efa\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u3001\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u7279\u5f81\u8bc6\u522b\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u878d\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u9762\u90e8\u8bc6\u522b\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002"}}

Advanced machine learning algorithms are employed to clean and preprocess the data, analyse its features, and automatically select appropriate visualizations. The system establishes the process of automating AI-based analysis and visualization from the context of data-driven environments, and eliminates the challenge of time-consuming manual data analysis. The combination of a Python Flask backend to access the dataset, paired with a React frontend, provides a robust platform that automatically interacts with Firebase Cloud Storage for numerous data processing and data analysis solutions and real-time sources. Key contributions include automatic and intelligent data cleaning, with imputation for missing values, and detection of outliers, via analysis of the data set. AI solutions to intelligently select features, using four different algorithms, and intelligent title generation and visualization are determined by the attributes of the dataset. These contributions were evaluated using two separate datasets to assess the platform's performance. In the process evaluation, the initial analysis was performed in real-time on datasets as large as 100000 rows, while the cloud-based demand platform scales to meet requests from multiple users and processes them simultaneously.

In many real-world settings, online interactions can be risky, and accurately specifying the reward and the safety cost information at each timestep can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories reflecting undesirable or risky behavior, implicitly conveying the behavior the agent should avoid. We refer to these trajectories as non-preferred trajectories. Unlike standard IL, which aims to mimic demonstrations, our agent must also learn to avoid risky behavior using non-preferred trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, SafeMIL, to learn a parameterized cost that predicts if the state-action pair is risky via \\textit{Multiple Instance Learning}.

Following the growing scientific interest in mechanistic interpretability, recent work encoded refusal behavior as a single direction in the model's latent space; e.g., computed as the difference between the centroids of harmful and harmless prompt representations. However, emerging evidence suggests that concepts in LLMs often appear to be encoded as a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the high-dimensional latent space. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel method leveraging Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to extract multiple refusal directions. To this end, we first prove that SOMs generalize the prior work's difference-in-means technique. We then train SOMs on harmful prompt representations to identify multiple neurons. By subtracting the centroid of harmless representations from each neuron, we derive a set of multiple directions expressing the refusal concept. We validate our method on an extensive experimental setup, demonstrating that ablating multiple directions from models' internals outperforms not only the single-direction baseline but also specialized jailbreak algorithms, leading to an effective suppression of refusal. Finally, we conclude by analyzing the mechanistic implications of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6620\u5c04(SOMs)\u4ece\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u4e2a\u62d2\u7edd\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4ee5\u66ff\u4ee3\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u5355\u4e00\u62d2\u7edd\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u591a\u65b9\u5411\u6d88\u878d\u6bd4\u5355\u65b9\u5411\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u8d8a\u72f1\u7b97\u6cd5\u66f4\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u62d2\u7edd\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u5c06\u62d2\u7edd\u884c\u4e3a\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u65b9\u5411\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u800cLLM\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u53ef\u80fd\u4ee5\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6d41\u5f62\u5f62\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6620\u5c04(SOMs)\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u4e2a\u62d2\u7edd\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u9996\u5148\u8bc1\u660eSOMs\u80fd\u591f\u6cdb\u5316\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u5747\u503c\u5dee\u7684\u6280\u672f\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u5bb3\u63d0\u793a\u8868\u793a\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3SOMs\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u591a\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u6bcf\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u51cf\u53bb\u65e0\u5bb3\u63d0\u793a\u8868\u793a\u7684\u8d28\u5fc3\u6765\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u8868\u8fbe\u62d2\u7edd\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u591a\u4e2a\u62d2\u7edd\u65b9\u5411\u6bd4\u5355\u4e00\u65b9\u5411\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u7b97\u6cd5\u66f4\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6291\u5236\u62d2\u7edd\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSOMs\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6291\u5236\u62d2\u7edd\u884c\u4e3a\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

We distinguish between behavioral faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and output) and perceptual faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and input), and introduce FaithEval for quantifying step-level and chain-level faithfulness by evaluating whether each claimed object is visually supported by the image. Building on these insights, we propose FaithAct, a faithfulness-first planning and acting framework that enforces evidential grounding at every reasoning step. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FaithAct improves perceptual faithfulness by up to 26% without degrading task accuracy compared to prompt-based and tool-augmented baselines. Our analysis shows that treating faithfulness as a guiding principle not only mitigates hallucination but also leads to more stable reasoning trajectories. This work thereby establishes a unified framework for both evaluating and enforcing faithfulness in multimodal reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u770b\u4f3c\u5408\u7406\u4f46\u4e0e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0d\u7b26\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u884c\u4e3a\u5fe0\u8bda\u5ea6\uff08\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u5fe0\u8bda\u5ea6\uff08\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FaithEval\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u5fe0\u8bda\u5ea6\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FaithAct\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u8bc1\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eFaithAct\u53ef\u5c06\u611f\u77e5\u5fe0\u8bda\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad826%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u4f7f\u63a8\u7406\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u7136\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u7ecf\u5e38\u751f\u6210\u770b\u4f3c\u5408\u7406\u4f46\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u8bc1\u636e\u6216\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u8bba\u8131\u8282\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFaithEval\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u5fe0\u8bda\u5ea6\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u884c\u4e3a\u5fe0\u8bda\u5ea6\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u5fe0\u8bda\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faFaithAct\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u8bc1\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "result": "FaithAct\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5c06\u611f\u77e5\u5fe0\u8bda\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8626%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u4f7f\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u5fe0\u8bda\u5ea6\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6307\u5bfc\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53ef\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6267\u884c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Recent Graph Neural Simulators (GNSs) accelerate simulations by learning dynamics on graph-structured data, yet often struggle to capture long-range interactions and suffer from error accumulation under autoregressive rollouts. To address these challenges, we propose Information-preserving Graph Neural Simulators (IGNS), a graph-based neural simulator built on the principles of Hamiltonian dynamics. This structure guarantees preservation of information across the graph, while extending to port-Hamiltonian systems allows the model to capture a broader class of dynamics, including non-conservative effects. IGNS further incorporates a warmup phase to initialize global context, geometric encoding to handle irregular meshes, and a multi-step training objective to reduce rollout error. To evaluate these properties systematically, we introduce new benchmarks that target long-range dependencies and challenging external forcing scenarios. Across all tasks, IGNS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNSs, achieving higher accuracy and stability under challenging and complex dynamical systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "IGNS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u539f\u7406\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u7559\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u5904\u7406\u975e\u4fdd\u5b88\u6548\u5e94\u3001\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u7f51\u683c\u548c\u591a\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u62df\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684GNS\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff08GNSs\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u7d2f\u79ef\u8bef\u5dee\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff08IGNS\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u57fa\u4e8e\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u7aef\u53e3\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u975e\u4fdd\u5b88\u6548\u5e94\u3002IGNS\u8fd8\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u4e2a\u9884\u70ed\u9636\u6bb5\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u591a\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "IGNS\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u5f3a\u8feb\u573a\u666f\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684GNSs\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "IGNS\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u590d\u6742\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u7d2f\u79ef\u8bef\u5dee\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7684GNSs\u66f4\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

Visual encoders exhibit attention bias toward background distractors, while decoders suffer from spatial misalignment when parsing geometrically deformed text-collectively degrading recognition accuracy for irregular patterns. Inspired by the hierarchical cognitive processes in human visual perception, we propose OTSNet, a novel three-stage network embodying a neurocognitive-inspired Observation-Thinking-Spelling pipeline for unified STR modeling. The architecture comprises three core components: (1) a Dual Attention Macaron Encoder (DAME) that refines visual features through differential attention maps to suppress irrelevant regions and enhance discriminative focus; (2) a Position-Aware Module (PAM) and Semantic Quantizer (SQ) that jointly integrate spatial context with glyph-level semantic abstraction via adaptive sampling; and (3) a Multi-Modal Collaborative Verifier (MMCV) that enforces self-correction through cross-modal fusion of visual, semantic, and character-level features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OTSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 83.5% average accuracy on the challenging Union14M-L benchmark and 79.1% on the heavily occluded OST dataset-establishing new records across 9 out of 14 evaluation scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "OTSNet\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u89c2\u5bdf-\u601d\u8003-\u62fc\u5199\uff09\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u573a\u666f\u6587\u672c\u8bc6\u522b\uff08STR\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709STR\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u4f18\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5931\u8c03\uff0c\u5f15\u8d77\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5bf9\u80cc\u666f\u5e72\u6270\u7269\u5b58\u5728\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5728\u89e3\u6790\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5f62\u6587\u672c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5931\u8c03\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u90fd\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u6587\u672c\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "OTSNet\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1.\u53cc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9a6c\u5361\u9f99\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08DAME\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u65e0\u5173\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u30022.\u4f4d\u7f6e\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\uff08PAM\uff09\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u91cf\u5316\u5668\uff08SQ\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u6574\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u5b57\u5f62\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\u30023.\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u540c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff08MMCV\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u5b57\u7b26\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u3002", "result": "OTSNet\u5728Union14M-L\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8683.5%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728OST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8679.1%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u521b\u4e0b\u4e8614\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u76849\u4e2a\u65b0\u7eaa\u5f55\u3002", "conclusion": "OTSNet\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86STR\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6210\u679c\u3002"}}

The evaluation of continual learning methods relies on splitting a known homogeneous dataset and learning the associated tasks one after the other. We argue that most CL methods introduce a priori information about the data to come and cannot be considered agnostic. We exemplify this point with the case of methods relying on pretrained feature extractors, which are still used in CL. After showing that pretrained feature extractors imply a loss of generality with respect to the data that can be learned by the model, we then discuss other kinds of a priori information introduced in other CL methods. We then present the Online Patch Redundancy Eliminator (OPRE), an online dataset compression algorithm, which, along with the training of a classifier at test time, yields performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 superior to a number of other state-of-the-art online continual learning methods.

To address these limitations, we propose PEOD, the first large-scale, pixel-aligned and high-resolution (1280 x 720) Event-RGB dataset for object detection under challenge conditions. PEOD contains 130+ spatiotemporal-aligned sequences and 340k manual bounding boxes, with 57% of data captured under low-light, overexposure, and high-speed motion. Furthermore, we benchmark 14 methods across three input configurations (Event-based, RGB-based, and Event-RGB fusion) on PEOD. On the full test set and normal subset, fusion-based models achieve the excellent performance. However, in illumination challenge subset, the top event-based model outperforms all fusion models, while fusion models still outperform their RGB-based counterparts, indicating limits of existing fusion methods when the frame modality is severely degraded.

From researchers choosing which problems to tackle next, to students deciding which ones to engage with, people's choices are often guided by judgments about how interesting or challenging problems are likely to be. As AI systems, such as LLMs, increasingly participate in mathematics with people -- whether for advanced research or education -- it becomes important to understand how well their judgments align with human ones. Our work examines this alignment through two empirical studies of human and LLM assessment of mathematical interestingness and difficulty, spanning a range of mathematical experience. We study two groups: participants from a crowdsourcing platform and International Math Olympiad competitors. We show that while many LLMs appear to broadly agree with human notions of interestingness, they mostly do not capture the distribution observed in human judgments. Moreover, most LLMs only somewhat align with why humans find certain math problems interesting, showing weak correlation with human-selected interestingness rationales. Together, our findings highlight both the promises and limitations of current LLMs in capturing human interestingness judgments for mathematical AI thought partnerships.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5728\u201c\u6709\u8da3\u6027\u201d\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5171\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u539f\u56e0\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6570\u5b66AI\u601d\u60f3\u4f19\u4f34\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22AI\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662fLLMs\uff09\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u201c\u6709\u8da3\u6027\u201d\u548c\u201c\u96be\u5ea6\u201d\u65b9\u9762\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765AI\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6765\u81ea\u4f17\u5305\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u56fd\u9645\u6570\u5b66\u5965\u6797\u5339\u514b\u7ade\u8d5b\u4e24\u7ec4\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cLLMs\u5bf9\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u6709\u8da3\u6027\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u53ca\u5176\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cLLMs\u5728\u5224\u65ad\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u201c\u6709\u8da3\u6027\u201d\u65b9\u9762\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5171\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u5230\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0cLLMs\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u9009\u62e9\u201c\u6709\u8da3\u6027\u201d\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u65b9\u9762\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8f83\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLMs\u5728\u5224\u65ad\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6709\u8da3\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u522b\uff08\u5982\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u539f\u56e0\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6570\u5b66AI\u601d\u60f3\u4f19\u4f34\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

However, real-world time series often exhibit non-stationarity, including temporal distribution shifts and spectral variability, which pose significant challenges for long-term time series forecasting. In this paper, we propose DTAF, a dual-branch framework that addresses non-stationarity in both the temporal and frequency domains. For the temporal domain, the Temporal Stabilizing Fusion (TFS) module employs a non-stationary mix of experts (MOE) filter to disentangle and suppress temporal non-stationary patterns while preserving long-term dependencies. For the frequency domain, the Frequency Wave Modeling (FWM) module applies frequency differencing to dynamically highlight components with significant spectral shifts. By fusing the complementary outputs of TFS and FWM, DTAF generates robust forecasts that adapt to both temporal and frequency domain non-stationarity. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DTAF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding significant improvements in forecasting accuracy under non-stationary conditions.

In this paper, we investigate heterogeneous multimodal domain adaptation, where the primary challenge is the varying domain shifts of different modalities from the source to the target domain. We first introduce the information bottleneck method to learn representations for each modality independently, and then match the source and target domains in the representation space with correlation alignment. To balance the domain alignment of all modalities, we formulate the problem as a multi-objective task, aiming for a Pareto optimal solution. By exploiting the properties specific to our model, the problem can be simplified to a quadratic programming problem. Further approximation yields a closed-form solution, leading to an efficient modality-balanced multimodal domain adaptation algorithm. The proposed method features \\textbf{B}alanced multi-\\textbf{o}bjective \\textbf{o}ptimization for \\textbf{m}ultimodal \\textbf{d}omain \\textbf{a}daptation, termed \\textbf{Boomda}.

Full-Reference Image Quality Assessment (FR-IQA) methods fail under misalignment, while No-Reference (NR-IQA) methods struggle with generalization. In this work, we introduce a Non-Aligned Reference (NAR-IQA) framework tailored for NVS, where it is assumed that the reference view shares partial scene content but lacks pixel-level alignment. We constructed a large-scale image dataset containing synthetic distortions targeting Temporal Regions of Interest (TROI) to train our NAR-IQA model. Our model is built on a contrastive learning framework that incorporates LoRA-enhanced DINOv2 embeddings and is guided by supervision from existing IQA methods. We train exclusively on synthetically generated distortions, deliberately avoiding overfitting to specific real NVS samples and thereby enhancing the model's generalization capability. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art FR-IQA, NR-IQA, and NAR-IQA methods, achieving robust performance on both aligned and non-aligned references.

However, current LULC models are typically developed for a specific modality and a fixed class taxonomy, limiting their generability and broader applicability. Recent advances in foundation models (FMs) offer promising opportunities for building universal models. Yet, task-agnostic FMs often require fine-tuning for downstream applications, whereas task-specific FMs rely on massive amounts of labeled data for training, which is costly and impractical in the remote sensing (RS) domain. To address these challenges, we propose LandSegmenter, an LULC FM framework that resolves three-stage challenges at the input, model, and output levels. From the input side, to alleviate the heavy demand on labeled data for FM training, we introduce LAnd Segment (LAS), a large-scale, multi-modal, multi-source dataset built primarily with globally sampled weak labels from existing LULC products. LAS provides a scalable, cost-effective alternative to manual annotation, enabling large-scale FM training across diverse LULC domains. For model architecture, LandSegmenter integrates an RS-specific adapter for cross-modal feature extraction and a text encoder for semantic awareness enhancement. At the output stage, we introduce a class-wise confidence-guided fusion strategy to mitigate semantic omissions and further improve LandSegmenter's zero-shot performance. We evaluate LandSegmenter on six precisely annotated LULC datasets spanning diverse modalities and class taxonomies. Extensive transfer learning and zero-shot experiments demonstrate that LandSegmenter achieves competitive or superior performance, particularly in zero-shot settings when transferred to unseen datasets.

These developments point toward the emergence of video foundation models that function not only as visual generators but also as implicit world models, models that simulate the physical dynamics, agent-environment interactions, and task planning that govern real or imagined worlds. This survey provides a systematic overview of this evolution, conceptualizing modern video foundation models as the combination of two core components: an implicit world model and a video renderer. The world model encodes structured knowledge about the world, including physical laws, interaction dynamics, and agent behavior. It serves as a latent simulation engine that enables coherent visual reasoning, long-term temporal consistency, and goal-driven planning. The video renderer transforms this latent simulation into realistic visual observations, effectively producing videos as a \"window\" into the simulated world. We trace the progression of video generation through four generations, in which the core capabilities advance step by step, ultimately culminating in a world model, built upon a video generation model, that embodies intrinsic physical plausibility, real-time multimodal interaction, and planning capabilities spanning multiple spatiotemporal scales.

Current approaches typically correlate global visual features with semantic information (i.e., attributes) or align local visual region features with corresponding attributes to enhance visual-semantic interactions. Although effective, these methods often overlook the intrinsic interactions between local region features, which can further improve the acquisition of transferable and explicit visual features. In this paper, we propose a network named Multi-Granularity Mutual Refinement Network (Mg-MRN), which refine discriminative and transferable visual features by learning decoupled multi-granularity features and cross-granularity feature interactions. Specifically, we design a multi-granularity feature extraction module to learn region-level discriminative features through decoupled region feature mining. Then, a cross-granularity feature fusion module strengthens the inherent interactions between region features of varying granularities. This module enhances the discriminability of representations at each granularity level by integrating region representations from adjacent hierarchies, further improving ZSL recognition performance.

To circumvent this, explanation-guided input manipulation has emerged as an indirect evaluation strategy, measuring explanation effectiveness through the impact of input modifications on model outcomes during inference. Despite the widespread use, a major concern with inference-based schemes is the distribution shift caused by such manipulations, which undermines the reliability of their assessments. The retraining-based scheme ROAR overcomes this issue by adapting the model to the altered data distribution. However, its evaluation results often contradict the theoretical foundations of widely accepted explainers. This work investigates this misalignment between empirical observations and theoretical expectations. In particular, we identify the sign issue as a key factor responsible for residual information that ultimately distorts retraining-based evaluation. Based on the analysis, we show that a straightforward reframing of the evaluation process can effectively resolve the identified issue. Building on the existing framework, we further propose novel variants that jointly structure a comprehensive perspective on explanation evaluation. These variants largely improve evaluation efficiency over the standard retraining protocol, thereby enhancing practical applicability for explainer selection and benchmarking. Following our proposed schemes, empirical results across various data scales provide deeper insights into the performance of carefully selected explainers, revealing open challenges and future directions in explainability research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u671f\u4e0d\u7b26\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u70ed\u70b9\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5730\u9762\u771f\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u4f7f\u5f97\u8bc4\u4f30\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\u5145\u6ee1\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u56e0\u8f93\u5165\u64cd\u4f5c\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002ROAR\u7b49\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u5374\u4e0e\u5e7f\u6cdb\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u76f8\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u671f\u4e0d\u7b26\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u201c\u7b26\u53f7\u95ee\u9898\u201d\u662f\u9020\u6210\u8bc4\u4f30\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u53d8\u4f53\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u201c\u7b26\u53f7\u95ee\u9898\u201d\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u548c\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u548c\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

To address these limitations, we propose a novel shadow generation framework based on a Keypoints Linear Model (KPLM) and a Shadow Triangle Algorithm (STA). KPLM models articulated human bodies using nine keypoints and one bounding block, enabling physically plausible shadow projection and dynamic shading across joints, thereby enhancing visual realism. STA further improves geometric accuracy by computing shadow angles, lengths, and spatial positions through explicit geometric formulations.

However, its scalability on large-scale graphs is hindered by the intensive message passing mechanism of GNN and the quadratic computational complexity of contrastive loss over positive and negative node pairs. To address these issues, we propose an efficient GCL framework that transforms the input graph into a compact network of interconnected node sets while preserving structural information across communities.

Considering the data heterogeneity issues across distributed nodes, we introduce two key components to ensure the effective learning of DistZSL: a cross-node attribute regularizer and a global attribute-to-visual consensus. Our proposed cross-node attribute regularizer enforces the distances between attribute features to be similar across different nodes. In this manner, the overall attribute feature space would be stable during learning, and thus facilitate the establishment of visual-to-attribute(V2A) relationships. Then, we introduce the global attribute-tovisual consensus to mitigate biased V2A mappings learned from individual nodes. Specifically, we enforce the bilateral mapping between the attribute and visual feature distributions to be consistent across different nodes. Thus, the learned consistent V2A mapping can significantly enhance zero-shot learning across different nodes.

Accepted for publication at AAAI 2026 (40th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence)", "summary": "Best-of-$N$ reasoning improves the accuracy of language models in solving complex tasks by sampling multiple candidate solutions and then selecting the best one based on some criteria. A critical bottleneck for this strategy is the output diversity limit, which occurs when the model generates similar outputs despite stochastic sampling, and hence recites the same error. To address this lack of variance in reasoning paths, we propose a novel unsupervised activation steering strategy that simultaneously optimizes the steering vectors for multiple reasoning trajectories at test time. At any synchronization anchor along the batch generation process, we find the steering vectors that maximize the total volume spanned by all possible intervened activation subsets. We demonstrate that these steering vectors can be determined by solving a Riemannian optimization problem over the product of spheres with a log-determinant objective function. We then use a Riemannian block-coordinate descent algorithm with a well-tuned learning rate to obtain a stationary point of the problem, and we apply these steering vectors until the generation process reaches the subsequent synchronization anchor. Empirical evaluations on popular mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that our test-time Riemannian activation steering strategy outperforms vanilla sampling techniques in terms of generative diversity and solution accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u7684Best-of-N\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u89e3\u5e76\u4ece\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u65f6\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u590d\u72af\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5b50\u96c6\u6240\u8de8\u8d8a\u7684\u603b\u4f53\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6c42\u89e3\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u7403\u4f53\u4e58\u79ef\u4e0a\u7684\u9ece\u66fc\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6570\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u9ece\u66fc\u5757\u5750\u6807\u4e0b\u964d\u7b97\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u9a7b\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\u76f4\u81f3\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u540c\u6b65\u951a\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9ece\u66fc\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709Best-of-N\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

We introduce \\ours, a novel unsupervised multi-class visual anomaly detection framework. It integrates a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) with a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for enhanced anomaly localization and detection. Specifically, a pre-trained VLM with a simple prompt extracts detailed image descriptions, serving as additional conditioning for LDM training. Current diffusion-based methods rely on synthetic noise generation, limiting their generalization and requiring per-class model training, which hinders scalability. \\ours, however, leverages VLMs to obtain normal captions without manual annotations or additional training.

Here, we present MolRuleLoss, a substructure-substitution-rule-informed framework that improves the accuracy and generalizability of multiple molecular property regression models (MPRMs) such as GEM and UniMol for diverse molecular property prediction tasks. MolRuleLoss incorporates partial derivative constraints for substructure substitution rules (SSRs) into an MPRM's loss function. When using GEM models for predicting lipophilicity, water solubility, and solvation-free energy (using lipophilicity, ESOL, and freeSolv datasets from MoleculeNet), the root mean squared error (RMSE) values with and without MolRuleLoss were 0.587 vs. 0.660, 0.777 vs. 0.798, and 1.252 vs. 1.877, respectively, representing 2.6-33.3% performance improvements. We show that both the number and the quality of SSRs contribute to the magnitude of prediction accuracy gains obtained upon adding MolRuleLoss to an MPRM. MolRuleLoss improved the generalizability of MPRMs for \"activity cliff\" molecules in a lipophilicity prediction task and improved the generalizability of MPRMs for OOD molecules in a melting point prediction task. In a molecular weight prediction task for OOD molecules, MolRuleLoss reduced the RMSE value of a GEM model from 29.507 to 0.007. We also provide a formal demonstration that the upper bound of the variation for property change of SSRs is positively correlated with an MPRM's error. Together, we show that using the MolRuleLoss framework as a bolt-on boosts the prediction accuracy and generalizability of multiple MPRMs, supporting diverse applications in areas like cheminformatics and AI-aided drug discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u6027\u8d28\u9884\u6d4b\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0d\u9ad8\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u5916\uff08OOD\uff09\u5206\u5b50\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002MolRuleLoss \u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u90e8\u5206\u504f\u5bfc\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5c06\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u66ff\u6362\u89c4\u5219\uff08SSRs\uff09\u6574\u5408\u5230\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u5b50\u6027\u8d28\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff08MPRMs\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "AI \u5728\u5206\u5b50\u6027\u8d28\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u5916\uff08OOD\uff09\u5206\u5b50\u65f6\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa MolRuleLoss \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u66ff\u6362\u89c4\u5219\uff08SSRs\uff09\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u504f\u5bfc\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u7eb3\u5165\u5206\u5b50\u6027\u8d28\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff08MPRMs\uff09\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u8102\u6eb6\u6027\u3001\u6c34\u6eb6\u6027\u548c\u6eb6\u5242\u5316\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u65f6\uff0cMolRuleLoss \u5c06 GEM \u6a21\u578b\u7684 RMSE \u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86 2.6%-33.3%\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8fd8\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u201c\u6d3b\u6027\u9661\u5d16\u201d\u5206\u5b50\u548c OOD \u5206\u5b50\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c06 OOD \u5206\u5b50\u7684 RMSE \u4ece 29.507 \u964d\u81f3 0.007\u3002", "conclusion": "MolRuleLoss \u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u79cd MPRMs \u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u5316\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u548c AI \u8f85\u52a9\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

However, existing methods focus on the reconstruction of visible regions, while the generation of occluded regions relies only on the generative prior of 3D GAN. As a result, the generated occluded regions often exhibit poor quality due to the information loss caused by the low bit-rate latent code. To address this, we introduce the warping-and-inpainting strategy to incorporate image inpainting into 3D GAN inversion and propose a novel 3D GAN inversion method, WarpGAN. Specifically, we first employ a 3D GAN inversion encoder to project the single-view image into a latent code that serves as the input to 3D GAN. Then, we perform warping to a novel view using the depth map generated by 3D GAN. Finally, we develop a novel SVINet, which leverages the symmetry prior and multi-view image correspondence w.r.t. the same latent code to perform inpainting of occluded regions in the warped image.

The majority of the work in algorithmic fairness focus on assessing and improving the fairness of machine learning systems. There is relatively little research on fairness vulnerability, i.e., how an AI system's fairness can be intentionally compromised. In this work, we first provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that a simple adversarial poisoning strategy is sufficient to induce maximally unfair behavior in naive Bayes classifiers. Our key idea is to strategically inject a small fraction of carefully crafted adversarial data points into the training set, biasing the model's decision boundary to disproportionately affect a protected group while preserving generalizable performance. To illustrate the practical effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments across several benchmark datasets and models. We find that our attack significantly outperforms existing methods in degrading fairness metrics across multiple models and datasets, often achieving substantially higher levels of unfairness with a comparable or only slightly worse impact on accuracy.

Achieving high detection performance requires that the estimated quality closely aligns with the actual localization accuracy. To this end, existing approaches predict the Intersection over Union (IoU) between the predicted and ground-truth (GT) boxes as a proxy for localization quality. However, box-level IoU prediction suffers from a structural coupling issue: since the predicted box is derived from the detector's internal estimation of the GT box, the predicted IoU--based on their similarity--can be overestimated for poorly localized boxes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Pixel-level Quality Assessment (PQA) framework, which replaces box-level IoU prediction with the integration of pixel-level spatial consistency. PQA measures the alignment between each pixel's relative position to the predicted box and its corresponding position to the GT box. By operating at the pixel level, PQA avoids directly comparing the predicted box with the estimated GT box, thereby eliminating the inherent similarity bias in box-level IoU prediction. Furthermore, we introduce a new integration metric that aggregates pixel-level spatial consistency into a unified quality score, yielding a more accurate approximation of the actual localization quality. Extensive experiments on HRSC2016 and DOTA demonstrate that PQA can be seamlessly integrated into various oriented object detectors, consistently improving performance (e.g., +5.96% AP$_{50:95}$ on Rotated RetinaNet and +2.32% on STD).", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Despite the advantages of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in single tasks, extending conventional RL methods to prioritized multiple objectives remains challenging. In particular, traditional Safe RL and Multi-Objective RL (MORL) methods have difficulty enforcing priority orderings efficiently. Therefore, Lexicographic Multi-Objective RL (LMORL) methods have been developed to address these challenges. However, existing LMORL methods either rely on heuristic threshold tuning with prior knowledge or are restricted to discrete domains. To overcome these limitations, we propose Lexicographically Projected Policy Gradient RL (LPPG-RL), a novel LMORL framework which leverages sequential gradient projections to identify feasible policy update directions, thereby enabling LPPG-RL broadly compatible with all policy gradient algorithms in continuous spaces. LPPG-RL reformulates the projection step as an optimization problem, and utilizes Dykstra's projection rather than generic solvers to deliver great speedups, especially for small- to medium-scale instances. In addition, LPPG-RL introduces Subproblem Exploration (SE) to prevent gradient vanishing, accelerate convergence and enhance stability. We provide theoretical guarantees for convergence and establish a lower bound on policy improvement. Finally, through extensive experiments in a 2D navigation environment, we demonstrate the effectiveness of LPPG-RL, showing that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art continuous LMORL methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a LPPG-RL \u7684\u65b0\u9896\u7684 Lexicographic Multi-Objective RL (LMORL) \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5177\u6709\u660e\u786e\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u987a\u5e8f\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u6240\u6709\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u517c\u5bb9\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cLPPG-RL \u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u63a2\u7d22 (SE) \u6765\u9632\u6b62\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u3001\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLPPG-RL \u5728\u8fde\u7eed LMORL \u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684 LMORL \u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u660e\u786e\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u9608\u503c\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u57df\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u3001\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "LPPG-RL \u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u987a\u5e8f\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u91cd\u5851\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528 Dykstra \u6295\u5f71\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u63a2\u7d22 (SE) \u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u3001\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728 2D \u5bfc\u822a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cLPPG-RL \u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u8fde\u7eed LMORL \u65b9\u6cd5\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "LPPG-RL \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684 LMORL \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u987a\u5e8f\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u548c\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u660e\u786e\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While neural network-based models have achieved notable success in this domain, complex channel-dependent models often suffer from performance degradation compared to channel-independent models that do not consider the relationship between components but provide high robustness due to small capacity. In this work, we propose HN-MVTS, a novel architecture that integrates a hypernetwork-based generative prior with an arbitrary neural network forecasting model. The input of this hypernetwork is a learnable embedding matrix of time series components. To restrict the number of new parameters, the hypernetwork learns to generate the weights of the last layer of the target forecasting networks, serving as a data-adaptive regularizer that improves generalization and long-range predictive accuracy. The hypernetwork is used only during the training, so it does not increase the inference time compared to the base forecasting model.

However, outside controlled laboratory settings, algorithms may encounter several challenges. In the medical domain, these difficulties often stem from limited data availability due to ethical and legal restrictions, as well as the high cost and time required for expert annotations-especially in the face of emerging or rare diseases. In this context, open-set recognition plays a vital role by identifying whether a sample belongs to one of the known classes seen during training or should be rejected as an unknown. Recent studies have shown that features learned in the later stages of deep neural networks are observed to cluster around their class means, which themselves are arranged as individual vertices of a regular simplex [32]. The proposed method introduces a loss function designed to reject samples of unknown classes effectively by penalizing open space regions using auxiliary datasets.

To address these issues, the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has developed various methods aimed at clarifying AI decision-making, thereby facilitating appropriate trust and validating the fairness of outcomes. Among these methods, prototype-based explanations offer a promising approach that uses representative examples to elucidate model behavior. However, a critical gap exists regarding standardized benchmarks to objectively compare prototype-based XAI methods, especially in the context of time series data. This lack of reliable benchmarks results in subjective evaluations, hindering progress in the field. We aim to establish a robust framework, ProtoScore, for assessing prototype-based XAI methods across different data types with a focus on time series data, facilitating fair and comprehensive evaluations. By integrating the Co-12 properties of Nauta et al., this framework allows for effectively comparing prototype methods against each other and against other XAI methods, ultimately assisting practitioners in selecting appropriate explanation methods while minimizing the costs associated with user studies.

We identify a significant limitation in image-conditioned 3D generative models: a strong canonical view bias. Through controlled experiments using simple 2D rotations, we show that the state-of-the-art Hunyuan3D 2.0 model can struggle to generalize across viewpoints, with performance degrading under rotated inputs. We show that this failure can be mitigated by a lightweight CNN that detects and corrects input orientation, restoring model performance without modifying the generative backbone. Our findings raise an important open question: Is scale enough, or should we pursue modular, symmetry-aware designs?", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u52303D\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u50cfHunyuan3D 2.0\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u65cb\u8f6c\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u4e5f\u4f1a\u9047\u5230\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684CNN\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7ea0\u6b63\u8f93\u5165\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u672c\u8eab\u3002\u8fd9\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u662f\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u6269\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u5c31\u8db3\u591f\u4e86\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u5e94\u8be5\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u5177\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u548c\u5bf9\u79f0\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1f", "motivation": "\u56fe\u50cf\u52303D\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u89c6\u89d2\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8fdb\u884c\u53d7\u63a7\u76842D\u65cb\u8f6c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5Hunyuan3D 2.0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7CNN\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7ea0\u6b63\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89d2\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86Hunyuan3D 2.0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u65cb\u8f6c\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4f1a\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7CNN\u8fdb\u884c\u65b9\u5411\u7ea0\u6b63\u540e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5f97\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6269\u5927\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u50cf\u52303D\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5177\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u548c\u5bf9\u79f0\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

While presenting notable progress for the Transformer architecture, iTransformer still lags behind the latest MLP-based models. We attribute this performance gap to unstable inter-channel relationships. To bridge this gap, we propose EMAformer, a simple yet effective model that enhances the Transformer with an auxiliary embedding suite, akin to armor that reinforces its ability. By introducing three key inductive biases, i.e., \\textit{global stability}, \\textit{phase sensitivity}, and \\textit{cross-axis specificity}, EMAformer unlocks the further potential of the Transformer architecture, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 12 real-world benchmarks and reducing forecasting errors by an average of 2.73\\% in MSE and 5.15\\% in MAE. This significantly advances the practical applicability of Transformer-based approaches for multivariate time series forecasting.

We utilize the Projected Normalized Coordinate Code (PNCC) to represent 3D geometry from a visible surface as a regular image, thereby circumventing the complexities of 3D point-based or RGB-guided methods. This design supports lightweight and fast models adaptable to various deployment environments.

Experiments show the Swin Transformer model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on standard benchmarks, while the Vision Mamba model delivers competitive results at real-time speeds.

We propose Adaptive Regularized Multi-Agent Soft Actor-Critic (ARAC), which integrates an attention-based graph neural network (GNN) for modeling agent dependencies with an adaptive divergence regularization mechanism. The GNN enables expressive representation of spatial relations and state features in graph environments. Divergence regularization can serve as policy guidance to alleviate the sparse reward problem, but it may lead to suboptimal convergence when the reference policy itself is imperfect. The adaptive divergence regularization mechanism enables the framework to exploit reference policies for efficient exploration in the early stages, while gradually reducing reliance on them as training progresses to avoid inheriting their limitations. Experiments in pursuit and confrontation scenarios demonstrate that ARAC achieves faster convergence, higher final success rates, and stronger scalability across varying numbers of agents compared with MARL baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in complex graph-structured environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "ARAC\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684GNN\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u4ee3\u7406\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53d1\u6563\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u673a\u5236\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MARL\uff09\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u8ffd\u9010\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8f6fActor-Critic\uff08ARAC\uff09\uff0c\u5b83\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNN\uff09\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u4ee3\u7406\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53d1\u6563\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u673a\u5236\u3002GNN\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u56fe\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u673a\u5236\u4f7f\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u53c2\u8003\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u65e9\u671f\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5e76\u968f\u7740\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8fdb\u884c\u9010\u6e10\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u5176\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u7ee7\u627f\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "result": "ARAC\u5728\u8ffd\u9010\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0eMARL\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4ee3\u7406\u6570\u91cf\u4e0b\u7684\u66f4\u5f3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ARAC\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u514b\u670d\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Code is available at: https://github.com/wxszreal0/DiPVNet", "summary": "Point cloud processing has become a cornerstone technology in many 3D vision tasks. However, arbitrary rotations introduce variations in point cloud orientations, posing a long-standing challenge for effective representation learning. The core of this issue is the disruption of the point cloud's intrinsic directional characteristics caused by rotational perturbations. Recent methods attempt to implicitly model rotational equivariance and invariance, preserving directional information and propagating it into deep semantic spaces. Yet, they often fall short of fully exploiting the multiscale directional nature of point clouds to enhance feature representations. To address this, we propose the Direction-Perceptive Vector Network (DiPVNet). At its core is an atomic dot-product operator that simultaneously encodes directional selectivity and rotation invariance--endowing the network with both rotational symmetry modeling and adaptive directional perception. At the local level, we introduce a Learnable Local Dot-Product (L2DP) Operator, which enables interactions between a center point and its neighbors to adaptively capture the non-uniform local structures of point clouds. At the global level, we leverage generalized harmonic analysis to prove that the dot-product between point clouds and spherical sampling vectors is equivalent to a direction-aware spherical Fourier transform (DASFT).

Traditional numerical solvers are computationally expensive and sensitive to discretisation, while canonical deep learning methods are data-hungry and struggle with chaotic dynamics and long-term predictions. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) mitigate some of these issues by incorporating physical constraints in the learning process, yet they remain limited by mesh resolution and long-term predictive stability. In this work, we propose a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) approach to solve PDE problems in cardiac EP. Unlike PINNs, PINO models learn mappings between function spaces, allowing them to generalise to multiple mesh resolutions and initial conditions. Our results show that PINO models can accurately reproduce cardiac EP dynamics over extended time horizons and across multiple propagation scenarios, including zero-shot evaluations on scenarios unseen during training. Additionally, our PINO models maintain high predictive quality in long roll-outs (where predictions are recursively fed back as inputs), and can scale their predictive resolution by up to 10x the training resolution.

Existing works primarily follow the localize-editing paradigm, focusing on independent object localization and editing while neglecting critical inter-object interactions. However, this work points out that the neglected attention entanglements in inter-object conflict regions, inherently hinder disentangled multi-object editing, leading to either inter-object editing leakage or intra-object editing constraints. We thereby propose a novel multi-layer disentangled editing framework LayerEdit, a training-free method which, for the first time, through precise object-layered decomposition and coherent fusion, enables conflict-free object-layered editing. Specifically, LayerEdit introduces a novel \"decompose-editingfusion\" framework, consisting of: (1) Conflict-aware Layer Decomposition module, which utilizes an attention-aware IoU scheme and time-dependent region removing, to enhance conflict awareness and suppression for layer decomposition. (2) Object-layered Editing module, to establish coordinated intra-layer text guidance and cross-layer geometric mapping, achieving disentangled semantic and structural modifications. (3) Transparency-guided Layer Fusion module, to facilitate structure-coherent inter-object layer fusion through precise transparency guidance learning. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of LayerEdit over existing methods, showing unprecedented intra-object controllability and inter-object coherence in complex multi-object scenarios.

Specifically, we condition the denoising process on a joint representation of VAE-encoded spatial features (derived from aerial RGB images and an estimated height map) and CLIP-based semantic embeddings. This design ensures the generation is both geometrically constrained by the scene's 3D structure and semantically consistent with its content.

In this paper, we propose a principled framework for self-improvement based on the concept of \\emph{coherence}, which requires that a model's outputs remain consistent under task-preserving transformations of the input.\n  We formalize this concept using projection-based mechanisms that update a baseline model to be coherent while remaining as close as possible to its original behavior. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees that these mechanisms achieve \\emph{monotonic improvement}, measured by a reduction in expected Bregman divergence. Our analysis is comprehensive, covering both \\emph{direct} and \\emph{two-step} projection methods, and robustly extends these guarantees to non-realizable settings, empirical (finite-sample) distributions, and relaxed coherence constraints.\n  Furthermore, we establish a general \\emph{characterization theorem}, showing that any mechanism with similar provable improvement guarantees must inherently conform to a coherence-based structure.

To address this, we introduce ImageBindDC, a novel data condensation framework operating within the unified feature space of ImageBind. Our approach moves beyond conventional distribution-matching by employing a powerful Characteristic Function (CF) loss, which operates in the Fourier domain to facilitate a more precise statistical alignment via exact infinite moment matching. We design our objective to enforce three critical levels of distributional consistency: (i) uni-modal alignment, which matches the statistical properties of synthetic and real data within each modality; (ii) cross-modal alignment, which preserves pairwise semantics by matching the distributions of hybrid real-synthetic data pairs; and (iii) joint-modal alignment, which captures the complete multivariate data structure by aligning the joint distribution of real data pairs with their synthetic counterparts. Extensive experiments highlight the effectiveness of ImageBindDC: on the NYU-v2 dataset, a model trained on just 5 condensed datapoints per class achieves lossless performance comparable to one trained on the full dataset, achieving a new state-of-the-art with an 8.2\\% absolute improvement over the previous best method and more than 4$\\times$ less condensation time.", "AI": {"tldr": "ImageBindDC\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6570\u636e\u51dd\u805a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728ImageBind\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u51fd\u6570\uff08CF\uff09\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5408\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6570\u636e\u51dd\u805a\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5e38\u5e38\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "ImageBindDC\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528ImageBind\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u51fd\u6570\uff08CF\uff09\u635f\u5931\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6765\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\uff1a\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728NYU-v2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u6bcf\u7c7b5\u4e2a\u51dd\u805a\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u53ef\u4e0e\u4f7f\u7528\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u635f\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u7edd\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e868.2%\uff0c\u51dd\u805a\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u77ed\u4e864\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "ImageBindDC\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u51dd\u805a\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

Existing approaches struggle to transfer knowledge effectively. We propose 'One Model for All', a universal pre-training framework for EEG analysis across disparate datasets. Our paradigm decouples learning into two stages: (1) Univariate pre-training via self-supervised contrastive learning on individual channels, enabled by a Unified Channel Schema (UCS) that leverages the channel union (e.g., SEED-62ch, DEAP-32ch); (2) Multivariate fine-tuning with a novel 'ART' (Adaptive Resampling Transformer) and 'GAT' (Graph Attention Network) architecture to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Experiments show universal pre-training is an essential stabilizer, preventing collapse on SEED (vs. scratch) and yielding substantial gains on DEAP (+7.65%) and DREAMER (+3.55%). Our framework achieves new SOTA performance on all within-subject benchmarks: SEED (99.27%), DEAP (93.69%), and DREAMER (93.93%). We also show SOTA cross-dataset transfer, achieving 94.08% (intersection) and 93.05% (UCS) on the unseen DREAMER dataset, with the former surpassing the within-domain pre-training benchmark. Ablation studies validate our architecture: the GAT module is critical, yielding a +22.19% gain over GCN on the high-noise DEAP dataset, and its removal causes a catastrophic -16.44% performance drop.

However, when facing extreme conditions (e.g., insufficient light, fierce camera motion), most existing methods suffer from significant information loss of RGB, severely damaging segmentation results. Several researches exploit the high-speed and high-dynamic event modality as a complement, but event and RGB are naturally heterogeneous, which leads to feature-level mismatch and inferior optimization of existing multi-modality methods. Different from these researches, we delve into the edge secret of both modalities for resilient fusion and propose a novel Edge-awareness Semantic Concordance framework to unify the multi-modality heterogeneous features with latent edge cues. In this framework, we first propose Edge-awareness Latent Re-coding, which obtains uncertainty indicators while realigning event-RGB features into unified semantic space guided by re-coded distribution, and transfers event-RGB distributions into re-coded features by utilizing a pre-established edge dictionary as clues. We then propose Re-coded Consolidation and Uncertainty Optimization, which utilize re-coded edge features and uncertainty indicators to solve the heterogeneous event-RGB fusion issues under extreme conditions. We establish two synthetic and one real-world event-RGB semantic segmentation datasets for extreme scenario comparisons. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by a 2.55% mIoU on our proposed DERS-XS, and possesses superior resilience under spatial occlusion.

Folder-based annotation workflows are usually slow, fatiguing, and difficult to scale. To address these challenges, we introduce SWipeable ANnotations (SWAN), an open-source, MIT-licensed web application that enables intuitive image patch classification using a swiping gesture. SWAN supports both desktop and mobile platforms, offers real-time metadata capture, and allows flexible mapping of swipe gestures to class labels. In a pilot study with four pathologists annotating 600 mitotic figure image patches, we compared SWAN against a traditional folder-sorting workflow. SWAN enabled rapid annotations with pairwise percent agreement ranging from 86.52% to 93.68% (Cohen's Kappa = 0.61-0.80), while for the folder-based method, the pairwise percent agreement ranged from 86.98% to 91.32% (Cohen's Kappa = 0.63-0.75) for the task of classifying atypical versus normal mitotic figures, demonstrating high consistency between annotators and comparable performance. Participants rated the tool as highly usable and appreciated the ability to annotate on mobile devices.

However, existing fusion methods are often either highly task-specific, or general frameworks that apply uniform strategies across diverse tasks, ignoring their distinct fusion mechanisms. To address this issue, we propose a mechanism-aware unsupervised general image fusion (MAUGIF) method based on dual cross-image autoencoders. Initially, we introduce a classification of additive and multiplicative fusion according to the inherent mechanisms of different fusion tasks. Then, dual encoders map source images into a shared latent space, capturing common content while isolating modality-specific details. During the decoding phase, dual decoders act as feature injectors, selectively reintegrating the unique characteristics of each modality into the shared content for reconstruction. The modality-specific features are injected into the source image in the fusion process, generating the fused image that integrates information from both modalities. The architecture of decoders varies according to their fusion mechanisms, enhancing both performance and interpretability. Extensive experiments are conducted on diverse fusion tasks to validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our method.

Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) offer a promising blueprint, but lack of practical guidance and theory has led to ad-hoc R&D. We present a comprehensive theory of JEPAs and instantiate it in {\\bf LeJEPA}, a lean, scalable, and theoretically grounded training objective. First, we identify the isotropic Gaussian as the optimal distribution that JEPAs' embeddings should follow to minimize downstream prediction risk. Second, we introduce a novel objective--{\\bf Sketched Isotropic Gaussian Regularization} (SIGReg)--to constrain embeddings to reach that ideal distribution. Combining the JEPA predictive loss with SIGReg yields LeJEPA with numerous theoretical and practical benefits: (i) single trade-off hyperparameter, (ii) linear time and memory complexity, (iii) stability across hyper-parameters, architectures (ResNets, ViTs, ConvNets) and domains, (iv) heuristics-free, e.g., no stop-gradient, no teacher-student, no hyper-parameter schedulers, and (v) distributed training-friendly implementation requiring only $\\approx$50 lines of code.

State-of-the-art multi-view methods learn to fuse predictions across views by training on large annotated datasets, leading to poor generalization when the test scenario differs. To overcome these limitations, we propose SkelSplat, a novel framework for multi-view 3D human pose estimation based on differentiable Gaussian rendering. Human pose is modeled as a skeleton of 3D Gaussians, one per joint, optimized via differentiable rendering to enable seamless fusion of arbitrary camera views without 3D ground-truth supervision. Since Gaussian Splatting was originally designed for dense scene reconstruction, we propose a novel one-hot encoding scheme that enables independent optimization of human joints. SkelSplat outperforms approaches that do not rely on 3D ground truth in Human3.6M and CMU, while reducing the cross-dataset error up to 47.8% compared to learning-based methods. Experiments on Human3.6M-Occ and Occlusion-Person demonstrate robustness to occlusions, without scenario-specific fine-tuning.

We revisit this paradox and show that sparsity is a surface artifact of a model-conditioned optimization bias: for a fixed pretrained model, updates consistently localize to preferred parameter regions, highly consistent across runs and largely invariant to datasets and RL recipes. We mechanistically explain these dynamics with a Three-Gate Theory: Gate I (KL Anchor) imposes a KL-constrained update; Gate II (Model Geometry) steers the step off principal directions into low-curvature, spectrum-preserving subspaces; and Gate III (Precision) hides micro-updates in non-preferred regions, making the off-principal bias appear as sparsity. We then validate this theory and, for the first time, provide a parameter-level characterization of RLVR's learning dynamics: RLVR learns off principal directions in weight space, achieving gains via minimal spectral drift, reduced principal-subspace rotation, and off-principal update alignment. In contrast, SFT targets principal weights, distorts the spectrum, and even lags RLVR.\n  Together, these results provide the first parameter-space account of RLVR's training dynamics, revealing clear regularities in how parameters evolve. Crucially, we show that RL operates in a distinct optimization regime from SFT, so directly adapting SFT-era parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods can be flawed, as evidenced by our case studies on advanced sparse fine-tuning and LoRA variants. We hope this work charts a path toward a white-box understanding of RLVR and the design of geometry-aware, RLVR-native learning algorithms, rather than repurposed SFT-era heuristics.", "AI": {"tldr": "RLVR\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u4e3b\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u65cb\u8f6c\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u201c\u4e09\u95e8\u7406\u8bba\u201d\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u5176\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03RL\u548cSFT\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "motivation": "RLVR\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8LLM\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u53ea\u4fee\u6539\u4e86\u5f88\u5c0f\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u76f4\u89c9\u76f8\u6096\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793aRLVR\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u5185\u5728\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u8868\u9762\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eSFT\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u4e09\u95e8\u7406\u8bba\u201d\u6765\u89e3\u91caRLVR\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u95e8I\uff08KL\u951a\u70b9\uff09\u65bd\u52a0KL\u7ea6\u675f\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b\u95e8II\uff08\u6a21\u578b\u51e0\u4f55\uff09\u5c06\u66f4\u65b0\u5f15\u5bfc\u81f3\u4f4e\u66f2\u7387\u3001\u4fdd\u6301\u9891\u8c31\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u95e8III\uff08\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff09\u9690\u85cf\u4e86\u975e\u4f18\u5148\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5fae\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u53c2\u6570\u5c42\u9762\u523b\u753bRLVR\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5982\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u9891\u8c31\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u4e3b\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u975e\u4e3b\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "RLVR\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u975e\u4e3b\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u9891\u8c31\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u4e3b\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u975e\u4e3b\u66f4\u65b0\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002SFT\u5219\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u4e3b\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u626d\u66f2\u9891\u8c31\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u6ede\u540e\u4e8eRLVR\u3002\u672c\u6587\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528SFT\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08PEFT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5230RLVR\u4e0a\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "conclusion": "RLVR\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u5177\u6709\u660e\u786e\u7684\u89c4\u5f8b\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5176\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\u4e0eSFT\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684SFT\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8eRLVR\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u611f\u77e5\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u539f\u751f\u4e8eRLVR\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u91cd\u65b0\u5229\u7528SFT\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9RLVR\u7684\u767d\u76d2\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Existing methods focus more on the physical learning of current state modeling, but generalize worse to future prediction. This is because existing methods ignore the intrinsic physical properties of deformable objects, resulting in the limited physical learning in the current state modeling. To address this, we present NeuSpring, a neural spring field for the reconstruction and simulation of deformable objects from videos. Built upon spring-mass models for realistic physical simulation, our method consists of two major innovations: 1) a piecewise topology solution that efficiently models multi-region spring connection topologies using zero-order optimization, which considers the material heterogeneity of real-world objects. 2) a neural spring field that represents spring physical properties across different frames using a canonical coordinate-based neural network, which effectively leverages the spatial associativity of springs for physical learning. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our NeuSping achieves superior reconstruction and simulation performance for current state modeling and future prediction, with Chamfer distance improved by 20% and 25%, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In contrast to MLPs, KANs leverage parameterized, trainable activation functions and offer several benefits including improved interpretability and higher accuracy on learning symbolic equations. However, the original KAN architecture requires adjustments to the domain discretization of the network (called the \"domain grid\") during training, creating extra overhead for the user in the training process. Typical KAN layers are not designed with the ability to autonomously update their domains in a data-driven manner informed by the changing output ranges of previous layers. As an added benefit, this histogram algorithm may also be applied towards detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs in a variety of settings.

In image classification, such inconsistencies manifest as negative flips, where an updated model misclassifies test samples that were previously classified correctly. This issue becomes increasingly pronounced as the number of training classes grows over time, since adding new categories reduces the margin of each class and may introduce conflicting patterns that undermine their learning process, thereby degrading performance on the original subset. To mitigate negative flips, we propose a novel approach that preserves the margins of the original model while learning an improved one. Our method encourages a larger relative margin between the previously learned and newly introduced classes by introducing an explicit margin-calibration term on the logits. However, overly constraining the logit margin for the new classes can significantly degrade their accuracy compared to a new independently trained model. To address this, we integrate a double-source focal distillation loss with the previous model and a new independently trained model, learning an appropriate decision margin from both old and new data, even under a logit margin calibration.

By leveraging deep learning-based risk models, screening intervals can be personalized, especially for high-risk individuals. While recent methods increasingly incorporate longitudinal information from prior mammograms, accurate spatial alignment across time points remains a key challenge. Misalignment can obscure meaningful tissue changes and degrade model performance. In this study, we provide insights into various alignment strategies, image-based registration, feature-level (representation space) alignment with and without regularization, and implicit alignment methods, for their effectiveness in longitudinal deep learning-based risk modeling. Using two large-scale mammography datasets, we assess each method across key metrics, including predictive accuracy, precision, recall, and deformation field quality.\n  Our results show that image-based registration consistently outperforms the more recently favored feature-based and implicit approaches across all metrics, enabling more accurate, temporally consistent predictions and generating smooth, anatomically plausible deformation fields. Although regularizing the deformation field improves deformation quality, it reduces the risk prediction performance of feature-level alignment. Applying image-based deformation fields within the feature space yields the best risk prediction performance.\n  These findings underscore the importance of image-based deformation fields for spatial alignment in longitudinal risk modeling, offering improved prediction accuracy and robustness.

However, sEMG-based systems often suffer from the scarcity of informative training data, leading to overfitting and poor generalization in deep learning models. Data augmentation offers a promising approach to increasing the size and diversity of training data, where faithfulness and diversity are two critical factors to effectiveness. However, promoting untargeted diversity can result in redundant samples with limited utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel diffusion-based data augmentation approach, Sparse-Aware Semantic-Guided Diffusion Augmentation (SASG-DA). To enhance generation faithfulness, we introduce the Semantic Representation Guidance (SRG) mechanism by leveraging fine-grained, task-aware semantic representations as generation conditions. To enable flexible and diverse sample generation, we propose a Gaussian Modeling Semantic Modeling (GMSS) strategy, which models the semantic representation distribution and allows stochastic sampling to produce both faithful and diverse samples. To enhance targeted diversity, we further introduce a Sparse-Aware Semantic Sampling strategy to explicitly explore underrepresented regions, improving distribution coverage and sample utility. Extensive experiments on benchmark sEMG datasets, Ninapro DB2, DB4, and DB7, demonstrate that SASG-DA significantly outperforms existing augmentation methods. Overall, our proposed data augmentation approach effectively mitigates overfitting and improves recognition performance and generalization by offering both faithful and diverse samples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSASG-DA\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3sEMG\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u611f\u77e5\u91c7\u6837\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "sEMG\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u5eb7\u590d\u548c\u5047\u80a2\u63a7\u5236\u7b49\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u9886\u57df\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e38\u9762\u4e34\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u867d\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5e73\u8861\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u751f\u6210\u5197\u4f59\u6837\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSASG-DA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1. \u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08SRG\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u30022. \u9ad8\u65af\u5efa\u6a21\u8bed\u4e49\u5efa\u6a21\uff08GMSS\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u5206\u5e03\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u5fe0\u5b9e\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6837\u672c\u30023. \u7a00\u758f\u611f\u77e5\u8bed\u4e49\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u6570\u636e\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u76ee\u6807\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5e03\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728Ninapro DB2\u3001DB4\u548cDB7\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6sEMG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eSASG-DA\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684SASG-DA\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u5fe0\u5b9e\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86sEMG\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Two widely used techniques to address this challenge are weight quantization, which lowers the precision of all weights, and structured sparsity, which removes unimportant weights while retaining the important ones at full precision. Although both are effective individually, they are typically studied in isolation due to their compounded negative impact on model accuracy when combined. In this work, we introduce SLOPE Structured Sparsity at Low Precision), a unified framework, to effectively combine structured sparsity and low-bit quantization in a principled way. We show that naively combining sparsity and quantization severely harms performance due to the compounded impact of both techniques. To address this, we propose a training-time regularization strategy that minimizes the discrepancy between full-precision weights and their sparse, quantized counterparts by promoting angular alignment rather than direct matching.

While various retrospective motion correction methods exist, many struggle to generalize across different motion types and body regions. In particular, machine learning (ML)-based corrections are often tailored to specific applications and datasets. We hypothesize that motion artifacts, though diverse, share underlying patterns that can be disentangled and exploited. To address this, we propose a hierarchical vector-quantized (VQ) variational auto-encoder that learns a disentangled embedding of motion-to-clean image features. A codebook is deployed to capture finite collection of motion patterns at multiple resolutions, enabling coarse-to-fine correction. An auto-regressive model is trained to learn the prior distribution of motion-free images and is used at inference to guide the correction process. Unlike conventional approaches, our method does not require artifact-specific training and can generalize to unseen motion patterns. We demonstrate the approach on simulated whole-body motion artifacts and observe robust correction across varying motion severity. Our results suggest that the model effectively disentangled physical motion of the simulated motion-effective scans, therefore, improving the generalizability of the ML-based MRI motion correction.

The success of RoPE has been thought to be due to its positional equivariance, i.e. its status as a relative positional encoding. In this paper, we mathematically show RoPE to be one of the most general solutions for equivariant positional embedding in one-dimensional data. Moreover, we show Mixed RoPE to be the analogously general solution for M-dimensional data, if we require commutative generators -- a property necessary for RoPE's equivariance. However, we question whether strict equivariance plays a large role in RoPE's performance. We propose Spherical RoPE, a method analogous to Mixed RoPE, but assumes non-commutative generators. Empirically, we find Spherical RoPE to have the equivalent or better learning behavior compared to its equivariant analogues. This suggests that relative positional embeddings are not as important as is commonly believed, at least within computer vision. We expect this discovery to facilitate future work in positional encodings for vision that can be faster and generalize better by removing the preconception that they must be relative.", "AI": {"tldr": "RoPE\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e00\u7ef4\u5e8f\u5217\u65b9\u9762\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u5f85\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86RoPE\u662f\u4e00\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7b49\u53d8\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u800cMixed RoPE\u662fM\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u7684\u901a\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u9700\u6ee1\u8db3\u4ea4\u6362\u751f\u6210\u5143\uff09\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5bf9\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u5728RoPE\u6027\u80fd\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8d28\u7591\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Spherical RoPE\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5141\u8bb8\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u751f\u6210\u5143\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSpherical RoPE\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e0e\u7b49\u53d8\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7269\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u9ad8\u4f30\u4e86\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30RoPE\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7a76\u5176\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "1. \u8bc1\u660eRoPE\u662f\u4e00\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6700\u901a\u7528\u7b49\u53d8\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002 2. \u63d0\u51faMixed RoPE\u4f5c\u4e3aM\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u7684\u901a\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u9700\u6ee1\u8db3\u4ea4\u6362\u751f\u6210\u5143\uff09\u3002 3. \u63d0\u51faSpherical RoPE\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5141\u8bb8\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u751f\u6210\u5143\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3aMixed RoPE\u7684\u7c7b\u6bd4\u3002 4. \u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83Spherical RoPE\u53ca\u5176\u7b49\u53d8\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7269\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "Spherical RoPE\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u7b49\u53d8\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7269\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u662fRoPE\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u9ad8\u4f30\u4e86\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u3002Spherical RoPE\u7684\u6210\u529f\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u975e\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Achieving expert-level diagnostic decisions requires integration of subtle image features with clinical knowledge. Yet major vision-language models (VLMs) treat images as holistic entities and overlook fine-grained image details that are vital for disease diagnosis. Clinicians analyze images by utilizing their prior medical knowledge and identify anatomical structures as important region of interests (ROIs). Inspired from this human-centric workflow, we introduce Anatomy-VLM, a fine-grained, vision-language model that incorporates multi-scale information. First, we design a model encoder to localize key anatomical features from entire medical images. Second, these regions are enriched with structured knowledge for contextually-aware interpretation. Finally, the model encoder aligns multi-scale medical information to generate clinically-interpretable disease prediction.

Current state-of-the-art methods learn a single, entangled forgery representation--conflating content-dependent flaws with content-agnostic artifacts--and are further constrained by outdated benchmarks. To overcome these limitations, we propose OmniAID, a novel framework centered on a decoupled Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. The core of our method is a hybrid expert system engineered to decouple: (1) semantic flaws across distinct content domains, and (2) these content-dependent flaws from content-agnostic universal artifacts. This system employs a set of Routable Specialized Semantic Experts, each for a distinct domain (e.g., human, animal), complemented by a Fixed Universal Artifact Expert. This architecture is trained using a bespoke two-stage strategy: we first train the experts independently with domain-specific hard-sampling to ensure specialization, and subsequently train a lightweight gating network for effective input routing. By explicitly decoupling \"what is generated\" (content-specific flaws) from \"how it is generated\" (universal artifacts), OmniAID achieves robust generalization. To address outdated benchmarks and validate real-world applicability, we introduce Mirage, a new large-scale, contemporary dataset. Extensive experiments, using both traditional benchmarks and our Mirage dataset, demonstrate our model surpasses existing monolithic detectors, establishing a new, robust standard for AIGI authentication against modern, in-the-wild threats.", "AI": {"tldr": "OmniAID\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u68c0\u6d4bAI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e13\u5bb6\u548c\u901a\u7528\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6Mirage\u4e5f\u968f\u4e4b\u53d1\u5e03\uff0c\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5730\u533a\u5206\u5185\u5bb9\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u548c\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u901a\u7528\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOmniAID\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\uff08Mixture-of-Experts, MoE\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5305\u542b\u591a\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u5185\u5bb9\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u3001\u52a8\u7269\uff09\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u4e13\u5bb6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\u5404\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u95e8\u63a7\u7f51\u7edc\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f93\u5165\u8def\u7531\u3002", "result": "OmniAID\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6Mirage\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9\u73b0\u4ee3\u73b0\u5b9e\u5a01\u80c1\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "OmniAID\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u89e3\u8026\u201c\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u4ec0\u4e48\u201d\uff08\u7279\u5b9a\u5185\u5bb9\u7f3a\u9677\uff09\u4e0e\u201c\u5982\u4f55\u751f\u6210\u201d\uff08\u901a\u7528\u4f2a\u5f71\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u8ba4\u8bc1\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u3001\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

While Integrated Gradients (IG) and related attribution methods have shown promise, applying them directly to WSIs introduces challenges due to their high-resolution nature. These methods capture model decision patterns but may overlook class-discriminative signals that are crucial for distinguishing between tumor subtypes. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Integrated Gradients (CIG), a novel attribution method that enhances interpretability by computing contrastive gradients in logit space. First, CIG highlights class-discriminative regions by comparing feature importance relative to a reference class, offering sharper differentiation between tumor and non-tumor areas. Second, CIG satisfies the axioms of integrated attribution, ensuring consistency and theoretical soundness. Third, we propose two attribution quality metrics, MIL-AIC and MIL-SIC, which measure how predictive information and model confidence evolve with access to salient regions, particularly under weak supervision. We validate CIG across three datasets spanning distinct cancer types: CAMELYON16 (breast cancer metastasis in lymph nodes), TCGA-RCC (renal cell carcinoma), and TCGA-Lung (lung cancer).

Addressing the critical challenge of data scarcity and heterogeneity, robust data pipeline was first developed to standardize and merge four public datasets (PBC, BCCD, Chula, Sickle Cell) into a unified resource. Then employed a state-of-the-art Faster R-CNN object detection framework, leveraging a ResNet-50-FPN backbone. Comparative training rigorously evaluated a randomly initialized baseline model (Regimen 1) against a Transfer Learning Regimen (Regimen 2), initialized with weights pre-trained on the Microsoft COCO dataset. The results demonstrate that the Transfer Learning approach achieved significantly faster convergence and superior stability, culminating in a final validation loss of 0.08666, a substantial improvement over the baseline.

An effective embedding is expected to comprehensively preserve the semantic content of the input while simultaneously emphasizing features that are discriminative for downstream tasks. Recent approaches demonstrate that VLMs can be adapted into competitive embedding models via large-scale contrastive learning, enabling the simultaneous optimization of two complementary objectives. We argue that the two aforementioned objectives can be decoupled: a comprehensive understanding of the input facilitates the embedding model in achieving superior performance in downstream tasks via contrastive learning. In this paper, we propose CoMa, a compressed pre-training phase, which serves as a warm-up stage for contrastive learning.

Although deep learning has achieved superior performance, the time and memory consumption of segmenting the entire 3D volume voxel by voxel using neural networks can be huge. Classifiers have been developed as an alternative in cases with certain points of interest, but the trade-off between speed and accuracy remains an issue. Thus, we propose a novel fast multi-organ segmentation framework with the usage of hierarchical sparse sampling and a Residual Transformer. Compared with whole-volume analysis, the hierarchical sparse sampling strategy could successfully reduce computation time while preserving a meaningful hierarchical context utilizing multiple resolution levels. The architecture of the Residual Transformer segmentation network could extract and combine information from different levels of information in the sparse descriptor while maintaining a low computational cost. In an internal data set containing 10,253 CT images and the public dataset TotalSegmentator, the proposed method successfully improved qualitative and quantitative segmentation performance compared to the current fast organ classifier, with fast speed at the level of ~2.24 seconds on CPU hardware.

Website: https://univa.online/", "summary": "While specialized AI models excel at isolated video tasks like generation or understanding, real-world applications demand complex, iterative workflows that combine these capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce UniVA, an open-source, omni-capable multi-agent framework for next-generation video generalists that unifies video understanding, segmentation, editing, and generation into cohesive workflows. UniVA employs a Plan-and-Act dual-agent architecture that drives a highly automated and proactive workflow: a planner agent interprets user intentions and decomposes them into structured video-processing steps, while executor agents execute these through modular, MCP-based tool servers (for analysis, generation, editing, tracking, etc.). Through a hierarchical multi-level memory (global knowledge, task context, and user-specific preferences), UniVA sustains long-horizon reasoning, contextual continuity, and inter-agent communication, enabling interactive and self-reflective video creation with full traceability. This design enables iterative and any-conditioned video workflows (e.g., text/image/video-conditioned generation $\\rightarrow$ multi-round editing $\\rightarrow$ object segmentation $\\rightarrow$ compositional synthesis) that were previously cumbersome to achieve with single-purpose models or monolithic video-language models. We also introduce UniVA-Bench, a benchmark suite of multi-step video tasks spanning understanding, editing, segmentation, and generation, to rigorously evaluate such agentic video systems. Both UniVA and UniVA-Bench are fully open-sourced, aiming to catalyze research on interactive, agentic, and general-purpose video intelligence for the next generation of multimodal AI systems.

Unlike existing sign language recognition methods that rely on 2D video, our approach directly utilizes 3D sign language data to capture rich spatial, gestural, and depth information in 3D scenes. This enables more accurate and resilient translation, enhancing digital communication accessibility for the hearing-impaired community. Beyond the task of ASL translation, our work explores the integration of complex, embodied multimodal languages into the processing capabilities of LLMs, moving beyond purely text-based inputs to broaden their understanding of human communication. We investigate both direct translation from 3D gesture features to text and an instruction-guided setting where translations can be modulated by external prompts, offering greater flexibility. This work provides a foundational step toward inclusive, multimodal intelligent systems capable of understanding diverse forms of language.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u624b\u8bed\u6a21\u578b\uff08LSLM\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9aa8\u5e72\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd13D\u7f8e\u56fd\u624b\u8bed\uff08ASL\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u542c\u969c\u4eba\u58eb\u8fdb\u884c\u865a\u62df\u4ea4\u6d41\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f25\u5408\u542c\u969c\u4eba\u58eb\u5728\u865a\u62df\u6c9f\u901a\u4e2d\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u7684\u3001\u5177\u8eab\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6574\u5408\u5230\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ea4\u6d41\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u75283D\u624b\u8bed\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6355\u63493D\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u624b\u52bf\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece3D\u624b\u52bf\u7279\u5f81\u5230\u6587\u672c\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "LSLM\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u5f39\u6027\u7684ASL\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6839\u636e\u5916\u90e8\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u6574\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u5b57\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u591f\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, obtaining precise camera poses in real-world settings remains challenging, even when calibration parameters are known. This limits the practicality of existing NeRF-based methods that rely heavily on accurate extrinsic estimates. Furthermore, their implicit volumetric representations differ significantly from the widely adopted polygonal meshes, making rendering and manipulation inefficient in standard 3D software. In this work, we propose a robust framework that reconstructs high-quality, editable 3D meshes directly from multi-view images with noisy extrinsic parameters. Our approach jointly refines camera poses while learning an implicit scene representation that captures fine geometric detail and photorealistic appearance. The resulting meshes are compatible with common 3D graphics and robotics tools, enabling efficient downstream use. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves accurate and robust 3D reconstruction under pose uncertainty, bridging the gap between neural implicit representations and practical robotic applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u7f16\u8f913D\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u5916\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eNeRF\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u901a\u5e38\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5176\u9690\u5f0f\u4f53\u79ef\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u591a\u8fb9\u5f62\u7f51\u683c\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u6807\u51c63D\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e2d\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u5e76\u5b66\u4e60\u9690\u5f0f\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u903c\u771f\u7684\u5916\u89c2\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u5e38\u75283D\u56fe\u5f62\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5de5\u5177\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u53ef\u7f16\u8f913D\u7f51\u683c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u59ff\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7f51\u683c\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0b\u6e38\u76843D\u56fe\u5f62\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u76843D\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u76f8\u673a\u5916\u53c2\u6570\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u4e0e\u5e38\u75283D\u5de5\u5177\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u9690\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e94\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

Integrating this functional information present in transcriptomic data with structural data from histopathology images is an active research area with applications in identifying tumor substructures associated with cancer drug resistance. Current histopathology-spatial-transcriptomic region segmentation methods suffer due to either making spatial transcriptomics prominent by using histopathology features just to assist processing spatial transcriptomics data or using vanilla contrastive learning that make histopathology images prominent due to only promoting common features losing functional information. In both extremes, the model gets either lost in the noise of spatial transcriptomics or overly smoothed, losing essential information. Thus, we propose our novel architecture SENCA-st (Shared Encoder with Neighborhood Cross Attention) that preserves the features of both modalities. More importantly, it emphasizes regions that are structurally similar in histopathology but functionally different on spatial transcriptomics using cross-attention. We demonstrate the superior performance of our model that surpasses state-of-the-art methods in detecting tumor heterogeneity and tumor micro-environment regions, a clinically crucial aspect.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSENCA-st\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6574\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u5272\u76f8\u5173\u533a\u57df\u65f6\u4e22\u5931\u529f\u80fd\u4fe1\u606f\u6216\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002SENCA-st\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u90bb\u57df\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u90a3\u4e9b\u5728\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4e0a\u76f8\u4f3c\u4f46\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66\u529f\u80fd\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u80bf\u7624\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u80bf\u7624\u5fae\u73af\u5883\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u6574\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5728\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4e22\u5931\u5173\u952e\u529f\u80fd\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u76f8\u5173\u533a\u57df\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u6216\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u5176\u72ec\u7279\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSENCA-st\uff08\u5171\u4eab\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0e\u90bb\u57df\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u4f7f\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6765\u5904\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u90bb\u57df\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6765\u878d\u5408\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u5728\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4e0a\u76f8\u4f3c\u4f46\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66\u4e0a\u529f\u80fd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u7a81\u51fa\u529f\u80fd\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "SENCA-st\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u80bf\u7624\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u80bf\u7624\u5fae\u73af\u5883\u533a\u57df\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u533a\u5206\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5bf9\u764c\u75c7\u6cbb\u7597\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u533a\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "SENCA-st\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u7559\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u7a81\u51fa\u529f\u80fd\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u80bf\u7624\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}
