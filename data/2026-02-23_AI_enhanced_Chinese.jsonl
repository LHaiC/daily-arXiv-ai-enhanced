However, existing approaches typically bifurcate into either non-editable raster image synthesis or abstract layout generation devoid of visual content. Recent combinations of these two approaches attempt to bridge this gap but often suffer from rigid composition schemas and unresolvable visual dissonances (e.g., text-background conflicts) due to their inexpressive representation and open-loop nature. To address these challenges, we propose DesignAsCode, a novel framework that reimagines graphic design as a programmatic synthesis task using HTML/CSS. Specifically, we introduce a Plan-Implement-Reflect pipeline, incorporating a Semantic Planner to construct dynamic, variable-depth element hierarchies and a Visual-Aware Reflection mechanism that iteratively optimizes the code to rectify rendering artifacts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DesignAsCode significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both structural validity and aesthetic quality. Furthermore, our code-native representation unlocks advanced capabilities, including automatic layout retargeting, complex document generation (e.g., resumes), and CSS-based animation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, such policies often exploit unnatural high-frequency signals that are unachievable by humans or physical robots, making them poor representations of real-world behaviors. Existing work addresses this issue by adding a reward term that penalizes a large change in actions over time. This term often requires substantial tuning efforts. We propose to use the action Jacobian penalty, which penalizes changes in action with respect to the changes in simulated state directly through auto differentiation. This effectively eliminates unrealistic high-frequency control signals without task specific tuning. While effective, the action Jacobian penalty introduces significant computational overhead when used with traditional fully connected neural network architectures. To mitigate this, we introduce a new architecture called a Linear Policy Net (LPN) that significantly reduces the computational burden for calculating the action Jacobian penalty during training. In addition, a LPN requires no parameter tuning, exhibits faster learning convergence compared to baseline methods, and can be more efficiently queried during inference time compared to a fully connected neural network. We demonstrate that a Linear Policy Net, combined with the action Jacobian penalty, is able to learn policies that generate smooth signals while solving a number of motion imitation tasks with different characteristics, including dynamic motions such as a backflip and various challenging parkour skills. Finally, we apply this approach to create policies for dynamic motions on a physical quadrupedal robot equipped with an arm.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

For a two-path model with unknown complex gains and delays, the Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for delay separation is derived and analyzed, confirming the benefit of larger frequency aperture, while revealing pronounced, separation-dependent oscillations driven by gap geometry and inter-path coupling.

In the single-path case, the combined subband responses determine how delay-domain sidelobe levels are distributed. The dominant peak spacing is set primarily by the separation between subband center frequencies. In the two-path case, increased aperture sharpens the mainlobe but also intensifies sidelobes and leakage, yielding competing peaks and, in some regimes, a dominant peak shifted from the true delay.

We refer to this emerging challenge as belief divergence. This article introduces reasoning native agentic communication, a new paradigm in which communication is explicitly designed to address belief divergence rather than merely transmitting representations. Instead of triggering transmissions based only on channel conditions or data relevance, the proposed framework activates communication according to predicted misalignment in agents internal belief states. We present a reasoning native architecture that augments the conventional communication stack with a coordination plane grounded in a shared knowledge structure and bounded belief modeling. Through enabling mechanisms and representative multi agent scenarios, we illustrate how such an approach can prevent coordination drift and maintain coherent behavior across heterogeneous systems.

A new method is introduced to transfer data from molecular dynamics to peridynamics by ensuring convergence of the tensile response of a single fiber in both frameworks.

We validate these theoretical predictions through behavioral experiments on six state-of-the-art model families, generating phase diagrams that precisely map the topological boundaries of safe behavior.

In this paper, we formalize a three-layer model-platform-user market game and identify conditions for the existence of pure Nash equilibrium.

Existing approaches aim to improve diversity in training partners to approximate human behavior, but these partners are static and fail to capture adaptive behavior of humans. Exposing robots to adaptive behaviors is critical, yet when both agents learn simultaneously in a multi-agent setting, they often converge to opaque implicit coordination strategies that only work with the agents they were co-trained with. Such agents fail to generalize when paired with new partners. In order to capture the adaptive behavior of humans, we model the human-robot teaming scenario as an Interactive Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (I-POMDP), explicitly modeling human adaptation as part of the state. We propose a nested training regime to approximately learn the solution to a finite-level I-POMDP. In this framework, agents at each level are trained against adaptive agents from the level below. This ensures that the ego agent is exposed to adaptive behavior during training while avoiding the emergence of implicit coordination strategies, since the training partners are not themselves learning. We train our method in a multi-episode, required cooperation setup in the Overcooked domain, comparing it against several baseline agents designed for human-robot teaming. We evaluate the performance of our agent when paired with adaptive partners that were not seen during training. Our results demonstrate that our agent not only achieves higher task performance with these adaptive partners but also exhibits significantly greater adaptability during team interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

An edge device, in collaboration with a hub device and a cloud server, often suffices for their reliable and efficient execution. However, task allocation in this streamlined architecture is challenging due to device limitations and diverse operating conditions. Given the inherent criticality of such workflow applications, where reliability and latency are vital yet conflicting objectives, an exact task allocation approach is typically required to ensure optimal solutions. As no existing method holistically addresses these issues, we propose an exact multi-objective task allocation framework to jointly optimize the overall reliability and latency of a workflow application in the specific edge-hub-cloud architecture. We present a comprehensive binary integer linear programming formulation that considers the relative importance of each objective. It incorporates time redundancy techniques, while accounting for crucial constraints often overlooked in related studies. We evaluate our approach using a relevant real-world workflow application, as well as synthetic workflows varying in structure, size, and criticality. In the real-world application, our method achieved average improvements of 84.19% in reliability and 49.81% in latency over baseline strategies, across relevant objective trade-offs.

Flexi-NeurA allows users to customize neuron models, network structures, and precision settings at design time. By pairing these design-time configurability and flexibility features with a time-multiplexed and event-driven processing approach, Flexi-NeurA substantially reduces the required hardware resources and total power while preserving high efficiency and low inference latency.

In this paper, we study the generalization where the input is an automatic structure -- potentially infinite, but describable by finite automata. We prove a striking dichotomy: homomorphism problems over automatic structures are either decidable in non-deterministic logarithmic space (NL), or undecidable. We show that structures for which the problem is decidable are exactly those with finite duality, which is a classical property of target structures asserting that the existence of a homomorphism into them can be characterized by the absence of a finite set of obstructions in the source structure. Notably, this property precisely characterizes target structures whose homomorphism problem is definable in first-order logic, which is well-known to be decidable over automatic structures. We also consider a natural variant of the problem. While automatic structures are finitely describable, homomorphisms from them into finite structures need not be. This leads to the notion of regular homomorphism, where the homomorphism itself must be describable by finite automata. Remarkably, we prove that this variant exhibits the same dichotomy, with the same characterization for decidability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

These algorithms often offer classical utility guarantees like no-regret, i.e., the agent's utility is at least the utility achieved by some benchmark in which it is assumed that every other agent's bidding remains the same. These guarantees offer compelling properties: They are optimal against stationary competition distributions, and in unconstrained settings, the resulting empirical distribution of play induced by no-regret dynamics approximates a Coarse Correlated Equilibrium. However, no-regret algorithms are easily manipulable, and in budgeted settings, no stronger notion of regret (such as swap regret) is currently known that would limit such manipulation.\n  We propose a very simple learning algorithm for budgeted sequential auctions where agents maximize their total number of wins and show that it has surprisingly appealing properties. We analyze this algorithm from two perspectives. First, we show that when an agent with a $\u03c1$ fraction of the total budget uses this algorithm, then she is guaranteed to win at least $\u03c1T - O(\\sqrt T)$ of the total $T$ rounds. This result holds for adversarial behavior by the other agents, as long as they respect their own budget restrictions. Second, we examine the scenario when all the agents follow our algorithm. By the first result, every agent's total wins are proportional to her budget, up to the additive $O(\\sqrt T)$ term. In addition, we show that this result holds in a much stronger sense: after an initial period of $O(\\sqrt T \\log T)$ rounds, every agent gets the same guarantee over any time interval. For intervals of length $O(\\sqrt T)$, we show that the deviation from the desired number of wins is an additive constant.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Reducing the physical demands of this task through intelligent and personalized assistance has significant implications, particularly in industries involving repetitive low-level assembly activities. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of a neural network controller for a modular Hip-Knee exoskeleton designed to assist squatting tasks. The neural network controller was trained via reinforcement learning (RL) in a physics-based, human-exoskeleton interaction simulation environment. The controller generated real-time hip and knee assistance torques based on recent joint-angle and velocity histories. Five healthy adults performed three-minute metronome-guided squats under three conditions: (1) no exoskeleton (No-Exo), (2) exoskeleton with Zero-Torque, and (3) exoskeleton with active assistance (Assistance). Physiological effort was assessed using indirect calorimetry and heart rate monitoring, alongside concurrent kinematic data collection. Results show that the RL-based controller adapts to individuals by producing torque profiles tailored to each subject's kinematics and timing. Compared with the Zero-Torque and No-Exo condition, active assistance reduced the net metabolic rate by approximately 10%, with minor reductions observed in heart rate. However, assisted trials also exhibited reduced squat depth, reflected by smaller hip and knee flexion. These preliminary findings suggest that the proposed controller can effectively lower physiological effort during repetitive squatting, motivating further improvements in both hardware design and control strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

A sixteen-microphone array is mounted on a robotic arm manipulator with seven degrees of freedom, with microphones divided into four groups of four, including one group positioned near the end-effector. The system reconfigures the array by adjusting the manipulator joint angles to place the end-effector microphones closer to the target speaker, thereby improving the reference signal quality. This proposed method integrates sound source localization techniques, computer vision, inverse kinematics, minimum variance distortionless response beamformer and time-frequency masking using a deep neural network. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach outperforms other traditional recording configruations, achieving higher scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio and lower word error rate accross multiple input signal-to-noise ratio conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In contrast, general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) lack the capability to interpret protein sequences and fall short in domain-specific knowledge, limiting their capacity for effective biosemantic reasoning. To combine the advantages of both, we propose BioBridge, a domain-adaptive continual pretraining framework for protein understanding. This framework employs Domain-Incremental Continual Pre-training (DICP) to infuse protein domain knowledge and general reasoning corpus into a LLM simultaneously, effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Cross-modal alignment is achieved via a PLM-Projector-LLM pipeline, which maps protein sequence embeddings into the semantic space of the language model. Ultimately, an end-to-end optimization is adopted to uniformly support various tasks, including protein property prediction and knowledge question-answering. Our proposed BioBridge demonstrates performance comparable to that of mainstream PLMs on multiple protein benchmarks, such as EC and BindingDB. It also achieves results on par with LLMs on general understanding tasks like MMLU and RACE.

Second, I observe that behavior datasets where positive and negative activations are better separated along the steering direction are more reliably steerable. Finally, steering vectors trained on different prompt variations are directionally distinct, yet perform similarly well and exhibit correlated efficacy across datasets.

Although linear momentum transfer from swift electrons to nanoparticles has been investigated theoretically and experimentally, subsequent analyzes revealed that several earlier predictions relied on non-causal dielectric functions or insufficient numerical convergence, leading to spurious sign reversals in the transferred momentum. Here, we derive analytical expressions and develop a numerically efficient electrodynamic framework to compute the linear momentum transferred from a swift electron to an isolated spherical nanoparticle described by a fully causal, local dielectric response. We apply our framework to large nanoparticles with 50 nm radius and explicitly resolve the spectral density of linear momentum transfer across the full frequency domain. Using causal dielectric functions for aluminum and bismuth, we analyze the role of electron velocity, impact parameter, and material-specific resonances. We find that, when causality and full multipolar convergence are enforced, the net transverse linear momentum transferred to spherical nanoparticles remains attractive toward the electron trajectory for all nanoparticles considered, despite the presence of material-dependent sign changes in individual electric and magnetic contributions. These results contrast with earlier theoretical predictions of net repulsive behavior and indicate that additional physical mechanisms beyond the present isolated, local description are required to account for experimentally observed repulsion.

This design enables context management through typed symbolic identifiers rather than raw text, thereby ensuring consistency, supporting provenance tracking, and enabling efficient tool orchestration. We evaluate the system by developing an automated benchmarking framework across a suite of university-level quantum chemistry tasks previously evaluated on a multi-agent system, demonstrating that a single agent, when coupled to a reliable execution engine, can robustly perform complex, multi-step, and parallel computations. We further extend this paradigm to two other large classes of applications: conformer ensemble generation and metal-organic framework design, where knowledge graphs serve as both memory and reasoning substrates.

It has been shown to be effective to use virtual IHC images from H&E images for automatic HER2 scoring. However, the pixel-level virtual staining methods are computationally expensive and prone to reconstruction artifacts that can propagate diagnostic errors.

The split also makes rate adaptation practical by confining the symmetry/frozen-bit requirements for phase resolution to the QPSK segment, enabling puncturing and shortening without breaking the pilot-free mechanism.

Here, we introduce El Agente S\u00f3lido, a hierarchical multi-agent framework for automating solid-state quantum chemistry workflows using the open-source Quantum ESPRESSO simulation package. The framework translates high-level scientific objectives expressed in natural language into end-to-end computational pipelines that include structure generation, input file construction, workflow execution, and post-processing analysis. El Agente S\u00f3lido integrates density functional theory with phonon calculations and machine-learning interatomic potentials to enable efficient and physically consistent simulations. Extensive benchmarking and case studies demonstrate that El Agente S\u00f3lido reliably executes a wide range of solid-state calculations, highlighting its potential to improve reproducibility and accelerate computational materials discovery", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Within this class of materials, a breadth of complex quantum behaviors, such as persistent spin-polarized current states in the presence of a broken time reversal symmetry, and temperature-independent topological protection of quantum states, are thought to exist. However, current studies using photoemission and spectroscopic analyses or transport experiments fail to provide insight into the interplay between the physical 2D manifold and the band topology itself, since they do not provide spatial resolution of the phenomena to be understood. In this work, we develop a methodology for applying magnetic force microscopy to such systems to address this issue. Using well-characterized 2D crystallites of bismuth telluride ($Bi_2$$Te_3$), we image the magnetic signal directly associated with topological edge states. The observed phase contrast is remarkably robust at a temperature of 25\u00b0C and occurs across crystallite sizes and shapes. A detailed analysis of the magnetic imaging suggests that the current observed is composed of two parts: the first is a persistent current ($I_{Persistent}$) as predicted by theory, and the second is due to Faraday induction, $I_{Faraday}$. Damping dynamics of the cantilever during imaging further suggest that this Faraday EMF is established by spin accumulation along the 1D edge channel of the crystal, which then converts to a charge current in the presence of time reversal symmetry breaking, creating a novel form of rectification in the channel.

However, the conventional \"one input, one output\" paradigm enforces a partition of the training budget, often allocating a significant portion (e.g., 75% in MeanFlow) solely to the multi-step objective for stability.

To enable temporal modeling in an encoder-only ViT, VidEoMT introduces a lightweight query propagation mechanism that carries information across frames by reusing queries from the previous frame. To balance this with adaptability to new content, it employs a query fusion strategy that combines the propagated queries with a set of temporally-agnostic learned queries. As a result, VidEoMT attains the benefits of a tracker without added complexity, achieving competitive accuracy while being 5x--10x faster, running at up to 160 FPS with a ViT-L backbone.

In this work, we propose a probabilistic forecasting framework specifically designed for field-level NDVI prediction under clear-sky acquisition constraints.

Iterative learning control (ILC) improves performance by using information from previous iterations to compensate for expected errors in future iterations. This work incorporates the use of Quasi-Periodic Gaussian Processes (QPGPs) into a predictive ILC framework to model and forecast disturbances and drift across iterations. Using a recent structural equation formulation of QPGPs, the proposed approach enables efficient inference with complexity $\\mathcal{O}(p^3)$ instead of $\\mathcal{O}(i^2p^3)$, where $p$ denotes the number of points within an iteration and $i$ represents the total number of iterations, specially for larger $i$. This formulation also enables parameter estimation without loss of information, making continual GP learning computationally feasible within the control loop. By predicting next-iteration error profiles rather than relying only on past errors, the controller achieves faster convergence and maintains this under time-varying disturbances. We benchmark the method against both standard ILC and conventional Gaussian Process (GP)-based predictive ILC on three tasks, autonomous vehicle trajectory tracking, a three-link robotic manipulator, and a real-world Stretch robot experiment.

Such understanding is essential for the rational design and exploitation of their properties in plasmonics, catalysis, and quantum optics. Existing electronic-structure studies are either scattered or focus on a few selected systems, and a comprehensive view of their band structures and Fermi surfaces remains missing.

We found that lattice type primarily fixes the shape and radial placement of the Fermi-lines, while out-of-plane buckling introduces controlled modifications: it shortens long straight Fermi-line segments, and occasionally creates, removes, or merges small Fermi-line pockets. The electronic configuration determines which orbital type dominates the Fermi level. We summarized Fermiology using a single score for each element, termed pocketness, derived from four descriptors that combine element properties (symmetry, coordination) with electronic characteristics (dispersion, Fermi-surface topology).

We introduce EgoPush, a policy learning framework that enables egocentric, perception-driven rearrangement without relying on explicit global state estimation that often fails in dynamic scenes. EgoPush designs an object-centric latent space to encode relative spatial relations among objects, rather than absolute poses. This design enables a privileged reinforcement-learning (RL) teacher to jointly learn latent states and mobile actions from sparse keypoints, which is then distilled into a purely visual student policy. To reduce the supervision gap between the omniscient teacher and the partially observed student, we restrict the teacher's observations to visually accessible cues. This induces active perception behaviors that are recoverable from the student's viewpoint. To address long-horizon credit assignment, we decompose rearrangement into stage-level subproblems using temporally decayed, stage-local completion rewards. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that EgoPush significantly outperforms end-to-end RL baselines in success rate, with ablation studies validating each design choice.

Under this model, the tracking lost issue arising from the misalignment between the pencil-like beams and the true target positions is inevitable, especially when the trajectories of the targets are complex, and the conventional Kalman filter-based scheme does not work well. To deal with this issue, we propose a Transformer-based mmWave multi-target tracking framework, namely m3TrackFormer, with a novel re-acquisition mechanism, such that even if the echo signals from some targets are too weak to extract sensing information, we are able to re-acquire their locations quickly with small beam sweeping overhead. Specifically, the proposed framework can operate in two modes of normal tracking and target re-acquisition during the tracking procedure, depending on whether the tracking lost occurs. When all targets are hit by the swept beams, the framework works in the Normal Tracking Mode (N-Mode) with a Transformer encoder-based Normal Tracking Network (N-Net) to accurately estimate the positions of these targets and predict the swept beams in the next time block. While the tracking lost happens, the framework will switch to the Re-Acquisition Mode (R-Mode) with a Transformer decoder-based Re-Acquisition Network (RNet) to adjust the beam sweeping strategy for getting back the lost targets and maintaining the tracking of the remaining targets.

In this work, we show that incorporating sparse multimodal range measurements provides a simple yet effective way to overcome these limitations. We introduce a multimodal depth reconstruction framework that leverages extremely sparse range sensing data, such as automotive radar or LiDAR, to produce dense depth maps that serve as robust geometric conditioning for diffusion-based novel view synthesis. Our approach models depth in an angular domain using a localized Gaussian Process formulation, enabling computationally efficient inference while explicitly quantifying uncertainty in regions with limited observations. The reconstructed depth and uncertainty are used as a drop-in replacement for monocular depth estimators in existing diffusion-based rendering pipelines, without modifying the generative model itself. Experiments on real-world multimodal driving scenes demonstrate that replacing vision-only depth with our sparse range-based reconstruction substantially improves both geometric consistency and visual quality in single-image novel-view video generation.

The effect of Nav processes is statistical by nature, as they consist of orbit determination (OD) and flight-path control (FPC). Thus, this mission design paradigm calls for techniques that appropriately quantify statistical effects of Nav, evaluate associated risks, and design missions that ensure sufficiently low risk while minimizing a statistical performance metric; a common metric is Delta-V99: worst-case (99%-quantile) Delta-V expenditure including statistical FPC efforts.

The term \"Zero-token\" specifically refers to removing the dedicated [CLS] aggregation token and positional embeddings; patch tokens remain unchanged and are processed normally. Adaptive residual projections preserve training stability in compact configurations while maintaining a strict parameter budget.\n  Evaluation is performed across seven MedMNIST datasets spanning binary and multi-class tasks under a strict few-shot protocol (50 samples per class, fixed hyperparameters, five random seeds). The empirical analysis demonstrates regime-dependent behavior: ZACH-ViT (0.25M parameters, trained from scratch) achieves its strongest advantage on BloodMNIST and remains competitive with TransMIL on PathMNIST, while its relative advantage decreases on datasets with strong anatomical priors (OCTMNIST, OrganAMNIST), consistent with the architectural hypothesis. These findings support the view that aligning architectural inductive bias with data structure can be more important than pursuing universal benchmark dominance. Despite its minimal size and lack of pretraining, ZACH-ViT achieves competitive performance while maintaining sub-second inference times, supporting deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments.

We propose a novel Greedy Sequential Sparse Bayesian Learning (GS-SBL) framework that bridges the gap between the computational efficiency of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) and the robust uncertainty quantification of SBL. Unlike standard top-down SBL, which updates all source hyperparameters simultaneously, our approach employs a ``Micro-SBL'' architecture.

Once identified, the source and its corresponding power are added to the support set, and the process repeats on the signal residual to identify subsequent sources. Experimental results on real-world 3D propagation data demonstrate that the GS-SBL framework significantly outperforms OMP in terms of generalization.

Across settings, compression reveals a persistent structural signature of probabilistic generation. In controlled and mediated contexts, LLM-produced language exhibits higher structural regularity and compressibility than human-written text, consistent with a concentration of output within highly recurrent statistical patterns.

We propose a method that can stably extract tracks of varying appearances of lines using a clever algorithmic process that observes multiple representations from various time slices of events, compensating for potential adversaries within the event data. We then propose geometric cost functions that can refine the 3D line maps and camera poses, eliminating projective distortions and depth ambiguities. The 3D line maps are highly compact and can be equipped with our proposed cost function, which can be adapted for any observations that can detect and extract line structures or projections of them, including 3D point cloud maps or image observations.

In-context learning (ICL) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm that enables LLMs to adapt to new tasks using examples provided within the input, eliminating the need for parameter updates.

Furthermore, this paper reveals two key challenges in the proposed task: 1) how to effectively model the coarse-to-fine physical-world information (e.g., human behavior, object interactions and background context) to boost the DeepSVU task; and 2) how to adaptively trade off these factors. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a new Unified Physical-world Regularized MoE (UPRM) approach. Specifically, UPRM incorporates two key components: the Unified Physical-world Enhanced MoE (UPE) Block and the Physical-world Trade-off Regularizer (PTR), to address the above two challenges, respectively. Extensive experiments conduct on our DeepSVU instructions datasets (i.e., UCF-C instructions and CUVA instructions) demonstrate that UPRM outperforms several advanced Video-LLMs as well as non-VLM approaches.

In SKC, object-level prototypes adaptively aggregate important patch tokens under the guidance of spatial knowledge. Moreover, in TKC, frame-level prototypes utilize temporal attributes to assist in inter-frame temporal relation modeling.

We present Zero-Shot IP (ZS-IP), a novel framework that couples multi-strategy manipulation (pushing and grasping) with a memory-driven Vision Language Model (VLM) to guide robotic interactions and resolve semantic queries. ZS-IP integrates three key components: (1) an Enhanced Observation (EO) module that augments the VLM's visual perception with both conventional keypoints and our proposed pushlines -- a novel 2D visual augmentation tailored to pushing actions, (2) a memory-guided action module that reinforces semantic reasoning through context lookup, and (3) a robotic controller that executes pushing, pulling, or grasping based on VLM output. Unlike grid-based augmentations optimized for pick-and-place, pushlines capture affordances for contact-rich actions, substantially improving pushing performance. We evaluate ZS-IP on a 7-DOF Franka Panda arm across diverse scenes with varying occlusions and task complexities.

However, predictive modeling of precipitate evolution remains challenging, in part because many key thermodynamic and kinetic parameters governing the underlying physics are either unknown or have a high degree of uncertainty. In this work, we developed a workflow in which experimental data were used to parameterize a phase-field model to perform two-dimensional (2D) simulations of concurrent nucleation and evolution of $\u03b2_1$ precipitates in magnesium-neodymium alloy during aging. Matrix composition and precipitate number density at different aging times were obtained from atom probe tomography and transmission electron microscopy measurements, respectively. We applied a stereological method to estimate the three-dimensional (3D) number densities from experimental cross-sectional transmission electron micrographs. The estimated 3D number density data were then converted to effective 2D number densities. The effective 2D number density and composition data were used to determine the required model parameters by minimizing the discrepancy between simulation and experimental results. The parameterized model allows for quantitative phase-field simulations of nucleation and growth of $\u03b2_1$ precipitates, which can be employed to optimize aging time to achieve a target number density of precipitates.

The fundamental challenge lies in determining how to reliably augment scarce financial time series data to enhance the predictive accuracy of deep learning forecasting models. Our main contribution is a demonstration of how Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can effectively serve as a data augmentation tool to overcome data scarcity in the financial domain.

Moving beyond prompt-level behaviors, we take a mechanistic perspective and identify a query-independent, universal activation subspace associated with clarification-seeking responses. Unlike prior cost-amplification attacks that rely on per-turn prompt optimization, our attack arises from conversational dynamics and persists across prompts and tasks. We show that this mechanism provides a scalable pathway to induce turn amplification: both supply-chain attacks via fine-tuning and runtime attacks through low-level parameter corruptions consistently shift models toward abstract, clarification-seeking behavior across prompts.

A common alternative is to use off-the-shelf smaller models as proxies, but they remain suboptimal since their learning dynamics are unclear, their sizes cannot be flexibly adjusted, and they cannot be further aligned with the target model in terms of gradient-based influence estimation. To address these challenges, we introduce Iprox, a two-stage framework that derives influence-preserving proxies directly from the target model.

Large language models (LLMs) can provide subgoal decompositions, plausible trajectories, and abstract priors that facilitate early learning.

We propose MIRA (Memory-Integrated Reinforcement Learning Agent), which incorporates a structured, evolving memory graph to guide early training. The graph stores decision-relevant information, including trajectory segments and subgoal structures, and is constructed from both the agent's high-return experiences and LLM outputs. This design amortizes LLM queries into a persistent memory rather than requiring continuous real-time supervision. From this memory graph, we derive a utility signal that softly adjusts advantage estimation to influence policy updates without modifying the underlying reward function. As training progresses, the agent's policy gradually surpasses the initial LLM-derived priors, and the utility term decays, preserving standard convergence guarantees. We provide theoretical analysis showing that utility-based shaping improves early-stage learning in sparse-reward environments. Empirically, MIRA outperforms RL baselines and achieves returns comparable to approaches that rely on frequent LLM supervision, while requiring substantially fewer online LLM queries.

Understanding the mechanisms governing when memorization versus generalization occurs remains an active area of research. In particular, it is unclear where along the noise schedule memorization is induced, how data geometry influences it, and how phenomena at different noise scales interact. We introduce a geometric framework that partitions the noise schedule into three regimes based on the coverage properties of training data by Gaussian shells and the concentration behavior of the posterior, which we argue are two fundamental objects governing memorization and generalization in diffusion models. This perspective reveals that memorization risk is highly non-uniform across noise levels. We further identify a danger zone at medium noise levels where memorization is most pronounced. In contrast, both the small and large noise regimes resist memorization, but through fundamentally different mechanisms: small noise avoids memorization due to limited training coverage, while large noise exhibits low posterior concentration and admits a provably near linear Gaussian denoising behavior. For the medium noise regime, we identify geometric conditions through which we propose a geometry-informed targeted intervention that mitigates memorization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We propose a different framing: Train the LM in a way that biases policy updates towards regions in which the reward is more accurate. First, we derive a theoretical connection between the accuracy of a reward model and the flatness of an optimum at convergence. Gradient regularization (GR) can then be used to bias training to flatter regions and thereby maintain reward model accuracy. We confirm these results by showing that the gradient norm and reward accuracy are empirically correlated in RLHF. We then show that Reference Resets of the KL penalty implicitly use GR to find flatter regions with higher reward accuracy. We further improve on this by proposing to use explicit GR with an efficient finite-difference estimate. Empirically, GR performs better than a KL penalty across a diverse set of RL experiments with LMs. GR achieves a higher GPT-judged win-rate in RLHF, avoids overly focusing on the format in rule-based math rewards, and prevents hacking the judge in LLM-as-a-Judge math tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We perform a series of experiments aimed at disentangling semantic and syntactic content in the two proto-tokens, analyzing stability properties of the e-token, and visualizing attention patterns to the e-token during reconstruction. Finally, we test two regularization schemes for \"imposing\" semantic structure on the e-token using teacher embeddings, including an anchor-based loss and a relational distillation objective. Our results indicate that the m-token tends to capture semantic information more strongly than the e-token under standard optimization; anchor-based constraints trade off sharply with reconstruction accuracy; and relational distillation can transfer batch-level semantic relations into the proto-token space without sacrificing reconstruction quality, supporting the feasibility of future non-autoregressive seq2seq systems that predict proto-tokens as an intermediate representation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Furthermore, we analyze the extent to which learned state-tracking mechanisms are shared across different sequence lengths. We show that transformers exhibit negligible or even detrimental weight sharing across lengths, indicating that they learn length-specific solutions in isolation. In contrast, recurrent models exhibit effective amortized learning by sharing weights across lengths, allowing data from one sequence length to improve performance on others.

Although this has led to significant progress in domains such as robotics, healthcare, and finance, the use of RL in practice is challenging, particularly when learning decision policies in high-stakes applications that may require guarantees. Traditional RL algorithms rely on a large number of online interactions with the environment, which is problematic in scenarios where online interactions are costly, dangerous, or infeasible. However, learning from offline datasets is hindered by the presence of hidden confounders. Such confounders can cause spurious correlations in the dataset and can mislead the agent into taking suboptimal or adversarial actions. Firstly, we address the problem of learning from offline datasets in the presence of hidden confounders. We work with instrumental variables (IVs) to identify the causal effect, which is an instance of a conditional moment restrictions (CMR) problem. Inspired by double/debiased machine learning, we derive a sample-efficient algorithm for solving CMR problems with convergence and optimality guarantees, which outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. Secondly, we relax the conditions on the hidden confounders in the setting of (offline) imitation learning, and adapt our CMR estimator to derive an algorithm that can learn effective imitator policies with convergence rate guarantees. Finally, we consider the problem of learning high-level objectives expressed in linear temporal logic (LTL) and develop a provably optimal learning algorithm that improves sample efficiency over existing methods.

To address this, we introduce Turbo Connection (TurboConn), a novel architecture that overcomes the fixed-depth constraint by routing multiple residual connections from the higher-layer hidden states of each token $t$ to the lower layers of token $t+1$. Fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs with our method not only yields accuracy gains of 0.9% to over 10% on benchmarks like GSM8K, Parity, and multi-step arithmetic, but also demonstrates that the density of these backward connections is critical; our dense interaction significantly outperforms \"sparse\" alternatives that only pass a single hidden state or vector. Notably, TurboConn can be integrated into pre-trained LLMs to overcome task-specific plateaus: while a fine-tuned Qwen-3-1.7B achieves only 53.78% on Parity, adding our architectural modification enables the model to reach 100% accuracy, all without the necessity to retrain the full model from scratch or sophisticated curriculum learning.

In this paper, we propose COMBA to tackle large graph learning using state space models, with two key innovations: graph context gating and cross batch aggregation. Graph context refers to different hops of neighborhood for each node, and graph context gating allows COMBA to use such context to learn best control of neighbor aggregation. For each graph context, COMBA samples nodes as batches, and train a graph neural network (GNN), with information being aggregated cross batches, allowing COMBA to scale to large graphs.

We provide the first rigorous theoretical analysis of this behavior, revealing fundamental limitations in both optimization dynamics and model capacity. First, in regard to the flattened PCC curve, we uncover a critical conflict where lowering MSE (magnitude matching) can paradoxically suppress the PCC gradient (shape matching). This issue is exacerbated by the softmax attention mechanism, particularly when the data to be aggregated is highly homogeneous. Second, we identify a limitation in the model capacity: we derived a PCC improvement limit for any convex aggregator (including the softmax attention), showing that the convex hull of the inputs strictly bounds the achievable PCC gain. We demonstrate that data homogeneity intensifies both limitations. Motivated by these insights, we propose the Extrapolative Correlation Attention (ECA), which incorporates novel, theoretically-motivated mechanisms to improve the PCC optimization and extrapolate beyond the convex hull.

Through a novel relative energy decomposition, we demonstrate that while the raw Marginal Energy landscape possesses a $1/t^p$ singularity normal to the data manifold, the learned time-invariant field implicitly incorporates a local conformal metric that perfectly counteracts the geometric singularity, converting an infinitely deep potential well into a stable attractor.

Experimental results demonstrate that input-space expansion significantly accelerates training convergence (reducing LBFGS iterations by 12\\% on average) and enhances approximation accuracy (reducing final MSE by 66.3\\% for the optimal 5D expansion). Ablation studies further reveal the effects of different expansion dimensions and constant selections, with $\u03c0$ consistently outperforming other constants.

We used a shared set of clinical and DXA-derived features across three large cohorts - the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS), and the UK Biobank (UKB), to systematically evaluate the performance of three domain adaptation methods - Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Correlation Alignment (CORAL), and Domain - Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN) and their combinations. For a source cohort with males only and a source cohort with females only, domain-adaptation methods consistently showed improved performance than the no-adaptation baseline (source-only training), and the use of combinations of multiple domain adaptation methods delivered the largest and most stable gains. The method that combines MMD, CORAL, and DANN achieved the highest discrimination with the area under curve (AUC) of 0.88 for a source cohort with males only and 0.95 for a source cohort with females only), demonstrating that integrating multiple domain adaptation methods could produce feature representations that are less sensitive to dataset differences.

It highly impacts learning outcomes and deepens inequities in education. While subsidy programs that transfer students from public to private schools offer a mechanism to alleviate congestion without capital-intensive construction, they often underperform due to fragmented data systems that hinder effective implementation. The Philippine Educational Service Contracting program, one of the world's largest educational subsidy programs, exemplifies these challenges, falling short of its goal to decongest public schools. This prevents the science-based and data-driven analyses needed to understand what shapes student enrollment flows, particularly how families respond to economic incentives and spatial constraints. We introduce a computational framework for modeling student flow patterns and simulating policy scenarios. By synthesizing heterogeneous government data across nearly 3,000 institutions, we employ a stochastic gravity model estimated via negative binomial regression to derive behavioral elasticities for distance, net tuition cost, and socioeconomic determinants. These elasticities inform a doubly constrained spatial allocation mechanism that simulates student redistribution under varying subsidy amounts while respecting both origin candidate pools and destination slot capacities. We find that geographic proximity constrains school choice four times more strongly than tuition cost and that slot capacity, not subsidy amounts, is the binding constraint.

In theory, one of the main problems in supervised learning is that of function approximation: that is, given some data set $\\mathcal{D}=\\{(x_j,f(x_j))\\}_{j=1}^M$, can one build a model $F\\approx f$? We introduce a method which aims to remedy several of the theoretical shortcomings of the current paradigm for supervised learning.\n  The second project deals with transfer learning, which is the study of how an approximation process or model learned on one domain can be leveraged to improve the approximation on another domain. We study such liftings of functions when the data is assumed to be known only on a part of the whole domain. We are interested in determining subsets of the target data space on which the lifting can be defined, and how the local smoothness of the function and its lifting are related.\n  The third project is concerned with the classification task in machine learning, particularly in the active learning paradigm. Classification has often been treated as an approximation problem as well, but we propose an alternative approach leveraging techniques originally introduced for signal separation problems.

However, traditional IRT describes a model's success on a task as a monotonic function of model capabilities and task demands, an approach unsuited to propensities, where both excess and deficiency can be problematic. Here, we introduce the first formal framework for measuring AI propensities by using a bilogistic formulation for model success, which attributes high success probability when the model's propensity is within an \"ideal band\". Further, we estimate the limits of the ideal band using LLMs equipped with newly developed task-agnostic rubrics. Applying our framework to six families of LLM models whose propensities are incited in either direction, we find that we can measure how much the propensity is shifted and what effect this has on the tasks. Critically, propensities estimated using one benchmark successfully predict behaviour on held-out tasks. Moreover, we obtain stronger predictive power when combining propensities and capabilities than either separately.

We introduce a Bakry-Emery graph Laplacian that integrates diffusion and advection through a learnable node-wise potential, inducing task-dependent propagation dynamics without modifying topology. This operator has a well-behaved spectral decomposition and acts as a drop-in replacement for standard Laplacians in spectral GNNs. Building on this insight, we develop mu-ChebNet, a spectral architecture that jointly learns the potential and Chebyshev filters, effectively bridging message-passing adaptivity and spectral efficiency. Our theoretical analysis shows how the potential modulates the spectrum, enabling control of key graph properties. Empirically, mu-ChebNet delivers consistent gains on synthetic long-range reasoning tasks, as well as real-world benchmarks, while offering an interpretable routing field that reveals how information flows through the graph.

We re-examine noisy RNN replay as sampling to understand or improve it in three ways: (1) Under simple assumptions, we prove that the gradients replay activity should follow are time-varying and difficult to estimate, but readily motivate the use of hidden state leakage in RNNs for replay. (2) We confirm that hidden state adaptation (negative feedback) encourages exploration in replay, but show that it incurs non-Markov sampling that also slows replay. (3) We propose the first model of temporally compressed replay in noisy path-integrating RNNs through hidden state momentum, connect it to underdamped Langevin sampling, and show that, together with adaptation, it counters slowness while maintaining exploration.

While machine learning-based surrogate models offer fast inference as a promising alternative, they suffer from degraded accuracy, particularly evaluated on complex urban layouts or out-of-distribution scenarios. Moreover, autoregressive prediction strategies in such models are prone to error accumulation over long forecasting horizons, limiting their robustness for extended-time simulations. To address these limitations, we propose RGD-Blast, a robust and generalizable deep surrogate model for high-fidelity, long-term blast wave forecasting. RGD-Blast incorporates a multi-scale module to capture both global flow patterns and local boundary interactions, effectively mitigating error accumulation during autoregressive prediction. We introduce a dynamic-static feature coupling mechanism that fuses time-varying pressure fields with static source and layout features, thereby enhancing out-of-distribution generalization. Experiments demonstrate that RGD-Blast achieves a two-order-of-magnitude speedup over traditional numerical methods while maintaining comparable accuracy. In generalization tests on unseen building layouts, the model achieves an average RMSE below 0.01 and an R2 exceeding 0.89 over 280 consecutive time steps. Additional evaluations under varying blast source locations and explosive charge weights further validate its generalization, substantially advancing the state of the art in long-term blast wave modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

SeedFlood departs from these practices by exploiting the seed-reconstructible structure of zeroth-order updates and effectively making the messages near-zero in size, allowing them to be flooded to every client in the network. This mechanism makes communication overhead negligible and independent of model size, removing the primary scalability bottleneck in decentralized training. Consequently, SeedFlood enables training in regimes previously considered impractical, such as billion-parameter models distributed across hundreds of clients. Our experiments on decentralized LLM fine-tuning demonstrate thatSeedFlood consistently outperforms gossip-based baselines in both generalization performance and communication efficiency, and even achieves results comparable to first-order methods in large scale settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We introduce RAT+, a dense-pretraining architecture that augments attention with full-sequence recurrence and active recurrence learning. A single RAT+ model is pretrained densely once, then flexibly switched at inference time to dilated attention (optionally with local windows) or hybrid layer/head compositions, requiring only a short 1B-token resolution adaptation rather than retraining separate sparse models. At 1.5B parameters trained on 100B tokens, RAT+ closely matches dense accuracy at 16 and drops by about 2-3 points at 64 on commonsense reasoning and LongBench tasks, respectively.

However, traditional architectures often rely on auxiliary networks such as encoders in Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) or discriminators in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which introduce training instability, computational overhead, and risks like mode collapse. We present NeuroSQL, a new generative paradigm that eliminates the need for auxiliary networks by learning low-dimensional latent representations implicitly. NeuroSQL leverages an asymptotic approximation that expresses the latent variables as the solution to an optimal transportation problem. Specifically, NeuroSQL learns the latent variables by solving a linear assignment problem and then passes the latent information to a standalone generator. We benchmark its performance against GANs, VAEs, and a budget-matched diffusion baseline on four datasets: handwritten digits (MNIST), faces (CelebA), animal faces (AFHQ), and brain images (OASIS). Compared to VAEs, GANs, and diffusion models: (1) in terms of image quality, NeuroSQL achieves overall lower mean pixel distance between synthetic and authentic images and stronger perceptual/structural fidelity; (2) computationally, NeuroSQL requires the least training time; and (3) practically, NeuroSQL provides an effective solution for generating synthetic data with limited training samples.

We study parameter-efficient domain adaptation for physics-informed self-attention based GNN, encouraging Kirchhoff-consistent behavior via a physics-based loss while restricting adaptation to low-rank updates. Specifically, we apply LoRA to attention projections with selective unfreezing of the prediction head to regulate adaptation capacity.

The unit is no longer a deterministic scalar but a distribution: computing is no longer about propagating values, but about contracting a continuous space of possibilities under constraints. Each neuron parameterizes a posterior, propagates a reparameterized sample and is regularized by the KL term of a local ELBO - hence, the activation is distributional. This \"contraction\" becomes testable through local constraints and can be monitored via internal measures. The amount of contextual information carried by the unit, as well as the temporal persistence of this information, are locally tuned by distinct constraints. This proposal addresses a structural tension: in sequential generation, causality is predominantly organized in the symbolic space and, even when latents exist, they often remain auxiliary, while the effective dynamics are carried by a largely deterministic decoder. In parallel, probabilistic latent models capture factors of variation and uncertainty, but that uncertainty typically remains borne by global or parametric mechanisms, while units continue to propagate scalars - hence the pivot question: if uncertainty is intrinsic to computation, why does the compute unit not carry it explicitly? We therefore draw two axes: (i) the composition of probabilistic constraints, which must be made stable, interpretable and controllable; and (ii) granularity: if inference is a negotiation of distributions under constraints, should the primitive unit remain deterministic or become distributional? We analyze \"collapse\" modes and the conditions for a \"living neuron\", then extend the contribution over time via autoregressive priors over the latent, per unit.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We recast model discovery as probabilistic inference, i.e., as sampling from an unknown distribution over mechanistic models capable of explaining the data. This perspective provides a unified way to reason about model proposal, refinement, and selection within a single inference framework. As a concrete instantiation of this view, we introduce ModelSMC, an algorithm based on Sequential Monte Carlo sampling. ModelSMC represents candidate models as particles which are iteratively proposed and refined by an LLM, and weighted using likelihood-based criteria. Experiments on real-world scientific systems illustrate that this formulation discovers models with interpretable mechanisms and improves posterior predictive checks.

Conventional machine learning approaches, such as Support Vector Machines, variants of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and tree-based methods like Random Forests, Extra Tree Regressors, and XGBoost, can capture nonlinearities but often struggle to respect the fundamental propeller law relationship between power and speed, resulting in poor extrapolation outside the training envelope. This study introduces a hybrid modeling framework that integrates physics-based knowledge from sea trials with data-driven residual learning. The baseline component, derived from calm-water power curves of the form $P = cV^n$, captures the dominant power-speed dependence, while another, nonlinear, regressor is then trained to predict the residual power, representing deviations caused by environmental and operational conditions. By constraining the machine learning task to residual corrections, the hybrid model simplifies learning, improves generalization, and ensures consistency with the underlying physics. In this study, an XGBoost, a simple Neural Network, and a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) coupled with the baseline component were compared to identical models without the baseline component. Validation on in-service data demonstrates that the hybrid model consistently outperformed a pure data-driven baseline in sparse data regions while maintaining similar performance in populated ones.
