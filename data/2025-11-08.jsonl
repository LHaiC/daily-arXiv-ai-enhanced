JUQCS-50 achieves this\nthrough three key innovations: (1) extending usable memory beyond GPU limits\nvia high-bandwidth CPU-GPU interconnects and LPDDR5 memory; (2) adaptive data\nencoding to reduce memory footprint with acceptable trade-offs in precision and\ncompute effort; and (3) an on-the-fly network traffic optimizer. These advances\nresult in an 11.4-fold speedup over the previous 48-qubit record on the K\ncomputer."}
