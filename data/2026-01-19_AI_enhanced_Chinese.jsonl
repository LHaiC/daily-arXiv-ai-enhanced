In this work, we explore the feasibility of implementing McDonald-style extractive summarization on a low-power CMOS coupled oscillator-based Ising machine (COBI) that supports integer-valued, all-to-all spin couplings. We first propose a hardware-aware Ising formulation that reduces the scale imbalance between local fields and coupling terms, thereby improving robustness to coefficient quantization: this method can be applied to any problem formulation that requires k of n variables to be chosen. We then develop a complete ES pipeline including (i) stochastic rounding and iterative refinement to compensate for precision loss, and (ii) a decomposition strategy that partitions a large ES problem into smaller Ising subproblems that can be efficiently solved on COBI and later combined. Experimental results on the CNN/DailyMail dataset show that our pipeline can produce high-quality summaries using only integer-coupled Ising hardware with limited precision. COBI achieves 3-4.5x runtime speedups compared to a brute-force method, which is comparable to software Tabu search, and two to three orders of magnitude reductions in energy, while maintaining competitive summary quality.

Various 3D-mapping-aided (3DMA) GNSS techniques, including shadow matching, have been proposed to address this issue. However, conventional shadow matching estimates positions in a discretized manner. The accuracy of this approach is limited by the resolution of the grid points representing the candidate receiver positions, making it difficult to achieve robust urban positioning and to ensure that the position estimate satisfies user-specified protection levels or safety bounds. To overcome these limitations, zonotope shadow matching (ZSM) has been proposed, which utilizes a set-based position estimate rather than grid-based estimates. ZSM calculates the GNSS shadow--an area on the ground where the line-of-sight (LOS) is blocked and only non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signals can be received--to estimate the receiver's position set. ZSM distinguishes between LOS and NLOS satellites, determining that the receiver is inside the GNSS shadow if the satellite is NLOS and outside if the satellite is LOS. However, relying solely on GNSS shadows limits the ability to sufficiently reduce the size of the receiver position set and to precisely estimate the receiver's location. To address this, we propose zonotope shadow and reflection matching (ZSRM) to enhance positioning accuracy in urban areas. The proposed ZSRM technique is validated through field tests using GNSS signals collected in an urban environment. Consequently, the RMS horizontal position error of ZSRM improved by 10.0% to 53.6% compared with ZSM, while the RMS cross-street and along-street position bounds improved by 18.0% to 50.1% and 30.7% to 59.3%, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The temporal evolution is modeled in the latent space and advanced through time-stepping, allowing for time-extrapolation, and the trajectories are consistently decoded onto geometrically parameterized domains using a GNN. Our framework enhances interpretability by enabling the analysis of the reduced dynamics and supporting zero-shot prediction through latent interpolation. The methodology is mathematically validated via a universal approximation theorem for encoder-free architectures, and numerically tested on complex computational mechanics problems involving physical and geometric parameters, including the detection of bifurcating phenomena for Navier-Stokes equations.

This paper presents RidgeWalker, a high-performance GRW accelerator designed for datacenter FPGAs.

Our results demonstrate on three benchmark event-based datasets that preprocessing leads to an advantageous trade-off between energy consumption and classification performance. Depending on the line-based preprocessing strategy and the complexity of the classification task, we show that one can maintain or increase the classification accuracy while significantly reducing the theoretical energy consumption.

This disparity leads to systematic underperformance, cultural misalignment, and limited accessibility for speakers of low-resource and extreme-low-resource languages. To address this gap, we introduce Bring Your Own Language (BYOL), a unified framework for scalable, language-aware LLM development tailored to each language's digital footprint. BYOL begins with a language resource classification that maps languages into four tiers (Extreme-Low, Low, Mid, High) using curated web-scale corpora, and uses this classification to select the appropriate integration pathway. For low-resource languages, we propose a full-stack data refinement and expansion pipeline that combines corpus cleaning, synthetic text generation, continual pretraining, and supervised finetuning. Applied to Chichewa and Maori, this pipeline yields language-specific LLMs that achieve approximately 12 percent average improvement over strong multilingual baselines across 12 benchmarks, while preserving English and multilingual capabilities via weight-space model merging. For extreme-low-resource languages, we introduce a translation-mediated inclusion pathway, and show on Inuktitut that a tailored machine translation system improves over a commercial baseline by 4 BLEU, enabling high-accuracy LLM access when direct language modeling is infeasible.

The rectangular surface code suffers from a relatively low threshold, while the XZZX code requires twice as many physical qubits to maintain the same code distance as the surface code. In this work, we introduce a 2D local code construction that outperforms these codes for noise biases $\u03b7\\ge 7\\times10^{4}$, reducing the qubit overhead by over 50% at $p_Z=10^{-3}$ and $\u03b7= 2 \\times 10^6$ to achieve a logical error rate of $10^{-12}$. Our construction relies on the concatenation of two classical codes. The inner codes are repetition phase-flip codes while the outer codes are high-rate bit-flip codes enabled by their implementation at the logical level, which circumvents device connectivity constraints. These results indicate that under sufficiently biased noise, it is advantageous to address phase-flip and bit-flip errors at different layers of the coding scheme. The inner code should prioritize a high threshold for phase-flip errors, while the bit-flip outer code should optimize for encoding rate efficiency.

In contrast, explicit thinking is highly configuration- and difficulty-dependent: planner-only thinking can improve decomposition and constraint tracking, while unrestricted full thinking often degrades performance by destabilizing tool orchestration, leading to skipped verification steps, excessive tool calls, non-termination, and output-format drift.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This paper advances an experimental framework for evaluating Institutional AI, our system-level approach to AI alignment that reframes alignment from preference engineering in agent-space to mechanism design in institution-space. Central to this approach is the governance graph, a public, immutable manifest that declares legal states, transitions, sanctions, and restorative paths; an Oracle/Controller runtime interprets this manifest, attaching enforceable consequences to evidence of coordination while recording a cryptographically keyed, append-only governance log for audit and provenance. We apply the Institutional AI framework to govern the Cournot collusion case documented by prior work and compare three regimes: Ungoverned (baseline incentives from the structure of the Cournot market), Constitutional (a prompt-only policy-as-prompt prohibition implemented as a fixed written anti-collusion constitution, and Institutional (governance-graph-based). Across six model configurations including cross-provider pairs (N=90 runs/condition), the Institutional regime produces large reductions in collusion: mean tier falls from 3.1 to 1.8 (Cohen's d=1.28), and severe-collusion incidence drops from 50% to 5.6%. The prompt-only Constitutional baseline yields no reliable improvement, illustrating that declarative prohibitions do not bind under optimisation pressure.

This paper presents AFLL (Adaptive Feedback Loop Learning), a real-time load stabilization system that learns the causal relationship between outgoing server messages and subsequent incoming client requests. AFLL employs backpropagation to continuously adjust message type weights, enabling predictive throttling that blocks low-priority messages before overload occurs while guaranteeing critical message delivery.

Digital Compute-in-Memory (DCiM) using SRAM offers a scalable solution, but its vast design space makes manual design impractical, creating a need for automated compilers. A key opportunity lies in approximate computing, which leverages the error tolerance of AI applications for significant energy savings. However, existing DCiM compilers focus on exact arithmetic, failing to exploit this optimization. This paper introduces OpenACM, the first open-source, accuracy-aware compiler for SRAM-based approximate DCiM architectures. OpenACM bridges the gap between application error tolerance and hardware automation. Its key contribution is an integrated library of accuracy-configurable multipliers (exact, tunable approximate, and logarithmic), enabling designers to make fine-grained accuracy-energy trade-offs. The compiler automates the generation of the DCiM architecture, integrating a transistor-level customizable SRAM macro with variation-aware characterization into a complete, open-source physical design flow based on OpenROAD and the FreePDK45 library.

Most existing pruning approaches impose sparsity through explicit intervention, such as importance-based thresholding or regularization penalties, implicitly treating pruning as a centralized decision applied to a trained model. This assumption is misaligned with the decentralized, stochastic, and path-dependent character of gradient-based training. We propose an evolutionary perspective on pruning: parameter groups (neurons, filters, heads) are modeled as populations whose influence evolves continuously under selection pressure. Under this view, pruning corresponds to population extinction: components with persistently low fitness gradually lose influence and can be removed without discrete pruning schedules and without requiring equilibrium computation. We formalize neural pruning as an evolutionary process over population masses, derive selection dynamics governing mass evolution, and connect fitness to local learning signals. We validate the framework on MNIST using a population-scaled MLP (784--512--256--10) with 768 prunable neuron populations. All dynamics reach dense baselines near 98\\% test accuracy.

Unlike traditional techniques, our implementation is deterministic, does not consume ancilla registers, does not modify the underlying data codes or registers, and is generic over all stabilizer codes. Thus, any single code becomes capable of universal quantum computation by leveraging helper codes in ancilla registers and mid-circuit measurements.

The subpixel-smoothed projection (SSP) method addresses this issue by smoothing sharp interfaces at the subpixel level through a first-order expansion of the filtered field. However, SSP does not guarantee differentiability under topology changes, such as the merging of two interfaces, and therefore violates the convergence guarantees of many popular gradient-based optimization algorithms. We overcome this limitation by regularizing SSP with the Hessian of the filtered field, resulting in a twice-differentiable projected density during such transitions, while still guaranteeing an almost-everywhere binary structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our second-order SSP (SSP2) methodology on both thermal and photonic problems, showing that SSP2 has faster convergence than SSP for connectivity-dominant cases -- where frequent topology changes occur -- while exhibiting comparable performance otherwise. Beyond improving convergence guarantees for CCSA optimizers, SSP2 enables the use of a broader class of optimization algorithms with stronger theoretical guarantees, such as interior-point methods.

Through quantitative analysis and mechanistic interpretability methods applied to reasoning traces, we find that reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B exhibit much greater perspective diversity than instruction-tuned models, activating broader conflict between heterogeneous personality- and expertise-related features during reasoning. This multi-agent structure manifests in conversational behaviors, including question-answering, perspective shifts, and the reconciliation of conflicting views, and in socio-emotional roles that characterize sharp back-and-forth conversations, together accounting for the accuracy advantage in reasoning tasks. Controlled reinforcement learning experiments reveal that base models increase conversational behaviors when rewarded solely for reasoning accuracy, and fine-tuning models with conversational scaffolding accelerates reasoning improvement over base models.

Despite their pivotal role in maintaining and improving site performance, CSOs have been largely overlooked by existing reporting standards. In this paper, we propose a suite of readily computable, actionable performance metrics-Fault Time, Fault-Reason Time, and Unreachable Time-that decompose charger behavior into operationally meaningful states. Unlike traditional uptime, these metrics are defined over configurable periods and distinguish between hardware malfunctions and network connectivity issues. We demonstrate the implementation of these metrics via an open-source tool that derives performance data from existing infrastructure without requiring hardware modifications.

Maintaining formation in a vehicle platoon requires designing a suitable control scheme that can tackle external disturbances and uncertain system parameters while maintaining a predefined safe distance between the robots. A crucial challenge in this context is dealing with the unknown/uncertain friction forces between wheels and the ground, which vary with changes in road surface, wear in tires, and speed of the vehicle. Although state-of-the-art adaptive controllers can handle a priori bounded uncertainties, they struggle with accurately modeling and identifying frictional forces, which are often state-dependent and cannot be a priori bounded.\n  This thesis proposes a new adaptive sliding mode controller for wheeled mobile robot-based vehicle platoons that can handle the unknown and complex behavior of frictional forces without prior knowledge of their parameters and structures. The controller uses the adaptive sliding mode control techniques to regulate the platoon's speed and maintain a predefined inter-robot distance, even in the presence of external disturbances and uncertain system parameters. This approach involves a two-stage process: first, the kinematic controller calculates the desired velocities based on the desired trajectory; and second, the dynamics model generates the commands to achieve the desired motion. By separating the kinematics and dynamics of the robot, this approach can simplify the control problem and allow for more efficient and robust control of the wheeled mobile robot.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the coordination stability intrinsic to unified agent systems, which causes severe inter-layer conflicts, unbounded error propagation, and restricted scalability. To address these challenges, we propose Constrained Temporal Hierarchical Architecture (CTHA), a general framework that projects the inter-layer communication space onto structured manifolds to restore coordination stability, while incorporating principled arbitration mechanisms to ensure coherent decision-making. Specifically, CTHA enforces three key constraints: (1) Message Contract Constraints that formalize information flow between layers via typed summary, plan, and policy packets; (2) Authority Manifold Constraints that bound each layer's decision space according to its temporal scope; and (3) Arbiter Resolution Constraints that guarantee conflict-free composition of multi-layer decisions. Empirical experiments demonstrate that CTHA is effective for complex task execution at scale, offering 47% reduction in failure cascades, 2.3x improvement in sample efficiency, and superior scalability compared to unconstrained hierarchical baselines.

By combining game theory and dynamic programming, we derive a recursive solution for the optimal state feedback policy valid for arbitrary initial states. The optimal policy is nonlinear in the state and requires solving a tractable convex scalar optimization for the Lagrange multiplier at each stage; the control is then explicit. For fixed disturbance budget $\u03b1$, the state space partitions into two distinct regions: $\\mathcal{X}_L(\u03b1)$, where the optimal control policy is linear and coincides with the standard linear $H_{\\infty}$ state feedback control, and $\\mathcal{X}_{NL}(\u03b1)$, where the optimal control policy is nonlinear.

This not only requires the agent to accurately accomplish given tasks but also to leverage long-term episodic memory to optimize decision-making.

To address this, we propose Long-term Memory Embodied Exploration (LMEE), which aims to unify the agent's exploratory cognition and decision-making behaviors to promote lifelong learning.We further construct a corresponding dataset and benchmark, LMEE-Bench, incorporating multi-goal navigation and memory-based question answering to comprehensively evaluate both the process and outcome of embodied exploration. To enhance the agent's memory recall and proactive exploration capabilities, we propose MemoryExplorer, a novel method that fine-tunes a multimodal large language model through reinforcement learning to encourage active memory querying.

Microscopic evidence to explain these effects is explored through analysing the distributions of the internal strain rate and local damage.

This study provides a large-scale, real-world benchmarking of easily implementable, data-driven strategies for optimizing the placement of permanent and temporary traffic sensors, using segment-level data from Berlin (Strava bicycle counts) and Manhattan (taxi counts). It compares spatial placement strategies based on network centrality, spatial coverage, feature coverage, and active learning. In addition, the study examines temporal deployment schemes for temporary sensors. The findings highlight that spatial placement strategies that emphasize even spatial coverage and employ active learning achieve the lowest prediction errors. With only 10 sensors, they reduce the mean absolute error by over 60% in Berlin and 70% in Manhattan compared to alternatives. Temporal deployment choices further improve performance: distributing measurements evenly across weekdays reduces error by an additional 7% in Berlin and 21% in Manhattan. Together, these spatial and temporal principles allow temporary deployments to closely approximate the performance of optimally placed permanent deployments.

As a result, stereo estimation networks trained on in-air data cannot transfer directly to the underwater domain. In addition, there is a lack of real-world underwater stereo datasets for supervised training of neural networks. Poor underwater depth estimation is compounded in stereo-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms, making it a fundamental challenge for underwater robot perception. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that enables sim-to-real training of underwater stereo disparity estimation networks using simulated data and self-supervised finetuning. We leverage our learned depth predictions to develop \\algname, a novel framework for real-time underwater SLAM that fuses stereo cameras with IMU, barometric, and Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) measurements. Lastly, we collect a challenging real-world dataset of shipwreck surveys using an underwater robot. Our dataset features over 24,000 stereo pairs, along with high-quality, dense photogrammetry models and reference trajectories for evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed training approach on real-world data for improving stereo estimation in the underwater domain and for enabling accurate trajectory estimation and 3D reconstruction of complex shipwreck sites.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Therefore, if a delay time occurs when a bearing is diagnosed with a defect, this may cause economic loss and loss of life. Moreover, since the vibration sensor from which the signal is collected is highly affected by the operating environment and surrounding noise, accurate defect diagnosis in a noisy environment is also important. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and strong robustness network (LSR-Net) that is accurate in a noisy environment and enables real-time fault diagnosis. To this end, first, a denoising and feature enhancement module (DFEM) was designed to create a 3-channel 2D matrix by giving several nonlinearity to the feature-map that passed through the denoising module (DM) block composed of convolution-based denoising (CD) blocks. Moreover, adaptive pruning was applied to DM to improve denoising ability when the power of noise is strong. Second, for lightweight model design, a convolution-based efficiency shuffle (CES) block was designed using group convolution (GConv), group pointwise convolution (GPConv) and channel split that can design the model while maintaining low parameters. In addition, the trade-off between the accuracy and model computational complexity that can occur due to the lightweight design of the model was supplemented using attention mechanisms and channel shuffle. In order to verify the defect diagnosis performance of the proposed model, performance verification was conducted in a noisy environment using a vibration signal.

In zb GaN, SFs form along (111) directions, giving one type each of intrinsic, extrinsic and twin SFs. Based on the calculated formation energy, I1 is the most stable SF of wz GaN in agreement with experiment. For zb GaN, the intrinsic stacking fault is the most dominant planar defect. To characterize the effect of the stacking faults on the electronic structure of the material, we examined the band density. We found that the bands near the valence band maximum in wz GaN are localised on the Ga-polar side of the stacking fault (i.e. on the Ga side of the Ga-N bonds perpendicular to the SF), with the bands near the conduction band minimum more on the N-polar side, though somewhat delocalised. We found the opposite trend in zb GaN; this behaviour is caused by a redistribution of charge near the interface.

ZPD Detector integrates difficulty calibration, model capability estimation based on Item Response Theory (IRT), and a capability-difficulty matching score to dynamically identify the most informative samples at each learning stage, improving data utilization efficiency; moreover, this dynamic matching strategy provides new insights into training strategy design.

End-to-end visuomotor policies bypass this structure, but often require large amounts of data, transfer poorly from simulation to reality, and generalize weakly across tasks/embodiments. We address those limitations by leveraging a simple insight: dexterous manipulation is inherently hierarchical - at a high level, a robot decides where to touch (geometry) and move the object (kinematics); at a low level it determines how to realize that plan through contact dynamics. Building on this insight, we propose a hierarchical RL--MPC framework in which a high-level reinforcement learning (RL) policy predicts a contact intention, a novel object-centric interface that specifies (i) an object-surface contact location and (ii) a post-contact object-level subgoal pose. Conditioned on this contact intention, a low-level contact-implicit model predictive control (MPC) optimizes local contact modes and replans with contact dynamics to generate robot actions that robustly drive the object toward each subgoal. We evaluate the framework on non-prehensile tasks, including geometry-generalized pushing and object 3D reorientation.

To address these limitations, we propose FAConvLSTM, a Factorized-Attention ConvLSTM layer designed as a drop-in replacement for ConvLSTM2D that simultaneously improves efficiency, spatial expressiveness, and physical interpretability. FAConvLSTM factorizes recurrent gate computations using lightweight [1 times 1] bottlenecks and shared depthwise spatial mixing, substantially reducing channel complexity while preserving recurrent dynamics. Multi-scale dilated depthwise branches and squeeze-and-excitation recalibration enable efficient modeling of interacting physical processes across spatial scales, while peephole connections enhance temporal precision. To capture teleconnection-scale dependencies without incurring global attention cost, FAConvLSTM incorporates a lightweight axial spatial attention mechanism applied sparsely in time.

The lack of reliability often leads to plausible but unreliable answers, introducing significant risks in many real-world scenarios. To this end, we propose Boundary-Aware Policy Optimization (BAPO), a novel RL framework designed to cultivate reliable boundary awareness without compromising accuracy.

Submitted to WiOpt 2026", "summary": "Split learning (SL) enables collaborative training of large language models (LLMs) between resource-constrained edge devices and compute-rich servers by partitioning model computation across the network boundary. However, existing SL systems predominantly rely on first-order (FO) optimization, which requires clients to store intermediate quantities such as activations for backpropagation. This results in substantial memory overhead, largely negating benefits of model partitioning. In contrast, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization eliminates backpropagation and significantly reduces memory usage, but often suffers from slow convergence and degraded performance. In this work, we propose HOSL, a novel Hybrid-Order Split Learning framework that addresses this fundamental trade-off between memory efficiency and optimization effectiveness by strategically integrating ZO optimization on the client side with FO optimization on the server side. By employing memory-efficient ZO gradient estimation at the client, HOSL eliminates backpropagation and activation storage, reducing client memory consumption. Meanwhile, server-side FO optimization ensures fast convergence and competitive performance. Theoretically, we show that HOSL achieves a $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{d_c/TQ})$ rate, which depends on client-side model dimension $d_c$ rather than the full model dimension $d$, demonstrating that convergence improves as more computation is offloaded to the server. Extensive experiments on OPT models (125M and 1.3B parameters) across 6 tasks demonstrate that HOSL reduces client GPU memory by up to 3.7$\\times$ compared to the FO method while achieving accuracy within 0.20%-4.23% of this baseline.

Human mobility plays a central role in shaping the spatial spread of epidemics, but mobility data are noisy, indirect, and difficult to integrate reliably with disease records.

These conditions limit the effectiveness of parameter-heavy mobility-aware forecasters that rely on clean and abundant data. In this work, we propose the Mobility-Informed Causal Adapter (MiCA), a lightweight and architecture-agnostic module for epidemic forecasting. MiCA infers mobility relations through causal discovery and integrates them into temporal forecasting models via gated residual mixing. This design allows lightweight forecasters to selectively exploit mobility-derived spatial structure while remaining robust under noisy and data-limited conditions, without introducing heavy relational components such as graph neural networks or full attention. Extensive experiments on four real-world epidemic datasets, including COVID-19 incidence, COVID-19 mortality, influenza, and dengue, show that MiCA consistently improves lightweight temporal backbones, achieving an average relative error reduction of 7.5\\% across forecasting horizons.

Consequently, selecting trustworthy collaborators becomes critical for realizing effective multi-hop collaboration. However, evaluating device trust requires the consideration of multiple factors, including relatively stable factors, such as historical interaction data, and dynamic factors, such as varying resources and network conditions. This differentiation makes it challenging to achieve the accurate evaluation of composite trust factors using one identical evaluation approach. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a composite and staged trust evaluation (CSTE) mechanism, where stable and dynamic factors are separately evaluated at different stages and then integrated for a final trust decision. First, a device interaction graph is constructed from stable historical interaction data to represent direct trust relationships between devices. A graph neural network framework is then used to propagate and aggregate these trust relationships to produce the historical trustworthiness of devices. In addition, a task-specific trust evaluation method is developed to assess the dynamic resources of devices based on task requirements, which generates the task-specific resource trustworthiness of devices. After these evaluations, CSTE integrates their results to identify devices within the network topology that satisfy the minimum trust thresholds of tasks. These identified devices then establish a trusted topology. Finally, within this trusted topology, an A* search algorithm is employed to construct a multi-hop collaboration path that satisfies the task requirements. Experimental results demonstrate that CSTE outperforms the comparison algorithms in identifying paths with the highest average trust values.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Our method first recalls features that are frequently co-activated on translation inputs and then filters them for functional coherence using a PCA-based consistency metric.

The prevalence of both of these aspects are shown to be related to the lower effective inertia of inverters and have implications for future widearea control system design. Greater disturbance localization implies the need for feedback measurement placement close to generator nodes to properly reject disturbances in the system while increased system controllability implies that widearea control systems should preferentially actuate inverters to most efficiently control the system.

To address this, we propose Think-with-Me, a novel test-time interactive reasoning paradigm that introduces external feedback intervention into the reasoning process. Our key insights are that transitional conjunctions serve as natural points for intervention, signaling phases of self-validation or exploration and using transitional words appropriately to prolong the reasoning enhances performance, while excessive use affects performance. Building on these insights, Think-with-Me pauses reasoning at these points for external feedback, adaptively extending or terminating reasoning to reduce redundancy while preserving accuracy.

While existing methods excel in single-person animation, they struggle to handle arbitrary subject counts, diverse character types, and spatial misalignment between the reference image and the driving poses.

To address these challenges, we propose CoDance, a novel Unbind-Rebind framework that enables the animation of arbitrary subject counts, types, and spatial configurations conditioned on a single, potentially misaligned pose sequence. Specifically, the Unbind module employs a novel pose shift encoder to break the rigid spatial binding between the pose and the reference by introducing stochastic perturbations to both poses and their latent features, thereby compelling the model to learn a location-agnostic motion representation. To ensure precise control and subject association, we then devise a Rebind module, leveraging semantic guidance from text prompts and spatial guidance from subject masks to direct the learned motion to intended characters. Furthermore, to facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we introduce a new multi-subject CoDanceBench.

The goal is to identify the important nodes and edges of an input graph that are crucial for performing a specific graph reasoning task. A number of studies have been conducted in this area, and various benchmark datasets have been proposed to facilitate evaluation. Among them, one of the most challenging is the Spurious-Motif benchmark, introduced at ICLR 2022. The datasets in this synthetic benchmark are deliberately designed to include spurious correlations, making it particularly difficult for models to distinguish truly relevant structures from misleading patterns. As a result, existing methods exhibit significantly worse performance on this benchmark compared to others.\n  In this paper, we focus on improving interpretability on the challenging Spurious-Motif datasets. We demonstrate that the self-reflection technique, commonly used in large language models to tackle complex tasks, can also be effectively adapted to enhance interpretability in datasets with strong spurious correlations. Specifically, we propose a self-reflection framework that can be integrated with existing interpretable graph learning methods. When such a method produces importance scores for each node and edge, our framework feeds these predictions back into the original method to perform a second round of evaluation. This iterative process mirrors how large language models employ self-reflective prompting to reassess their previous outputs.

However, existing methods still have limitations in capturing complex sequence dependencies and distinguishing confusing samples with high similarity. To address these challenges, we propose AVP-Pro, a novel two-stage predictive framework that integrates adaptive feature fusion and contrastive learning. To comprehensively capture the physicochemical properties and deep-seated patterns of peptide sequences, we constructed a panoramic feature space encompassing 10 distinct descriptors and designed a hierarchical fusion architecture. This architecture integrates self-attention and adaptive gating mechanisms to dynamically modulate the weights of local motifs extracted by CNNs and global dependencies captured by BiLSTMs based on sequence context. Targeting the blurred decision boundary caused by the high similarity between positive and negative sample sequences, we adopted an Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM)-driven contrastive learning strategy enhanced by BLOSUM62. This approach significantly sharpened the model's discriminative power. Model evaluation results show that in the first stage of general AVP identification, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.9531 and an MCC of 0.9064, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In the second stage of functional subtype prediction, combined with a transfer learning strategy, the model realized accurate classification of 6 viral families and 8 specific viruses under small-sample conditions.

Recent advancements have introduced explicit intermediary reasoning, such as sub-task prediction (language) or goal image synthesis (vision), to guide action generation. However, these intermediate reasoning are often indirect and inherently limited in their capacity to convey the full, granular information required for precise action execution. Instead, we posit that the most effective form of reasoning is one that deliberates directly in the action space. We introduce Action Chain-of-Thought (ACoT), a paradigm where the reasoning process itself is formulated as a structured sequence of coarse action intents that guide the final policy. In this paper, we propose ACoT-VLA, a novel architecture that materializes the ACoT paradigm. Specifically, we introduce two complementary components: an Explicit Action Reasoner (EAR) and Implicit Action Reasoner (IAR). The former proposes coarse reference trajectories as explicit action-level reasoning steps, while the latter extracts latent action priors from internal representations of multimodal input, co-forming an ACoT that conditions the downstream action head to enable grounded policy learning.

In the problem, there is a set of users and services, each associated with a set of descriptive features. Interactions between users and services produce feedback values, typically represented as numerical QoS metrics such as response time or availability. Given the observed feedback for a subset of user-service pairs, the goal is to predict the QoS values for the remaining pairs.\n  A key challenge in QoS prediction is the inherent sparsity of user-service interactions, as only a small subset of feedback values is typically observed. To address this, we propose a self-augmented strategy that leverages a model's own predictions for iterative refinement. In particular, we partially mask the predicted values and feed them back into the model to predict again. Building on this idea, we design a self-augmented mixture-of-experts model, where multiple expert networks iteratively and collaboratively estimate QoS values. We find that the iterative augmentation process naturally aligns with the MoE architecture by enabling inter-expert communication: in the second round, each expert receives the first-round predictions and refines its output accordingly.

A key challenge lies in jointly capturing the discrete semantic structure of tasks and the temporal evolution of object-centric geometric relations in a form that supports reasoning over task progression. In this work, we introduce a semantic-geometric task graph-representation that encodes object identities, inter-object relations, and their temporal geometric evolution from human demonstrations. Building on this formulation, we propose a learning framework that combines a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) encoder with a Transformer-based decoder, decoupling scene representation learning from action-conditioned reasoning about task progression. The encoder operates solely on temporal scene graphs to learn structured representations, while the decoder conditions on action-context to predict future action sequences, associated objects, and object motions over extended time horizons. Through extensive evaluation on human demonstration datasets, we show that semantic-geometric task graph-representations are particularly beneficial for tasks with high action and object variability, where simpler sequence-based models struggle to capture task progression. Finally, we demonstrate that task graph representations can be transferred to a physical bimanual robot and used for online action selection, highlighting their potential as reusable task abstractions for downstream decision-making in manipulation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This work presents an optimization-based, quantum-enhanced approach to patient stratification that explicitly minimizes covariate imbalance across numerical and categorical variables, without altering protocol design or trial endpoints.

Clustering requires a balance between abstraction and representation. To identify clusters, we need to abstract from superfluous details of individual objects. But we also need a rich representation that emphasizes the key features shared by groups of objects that distinguish them from other groups of objects.\n  Each clustering algorithm implements a different trade-off between abstraction and representation. Classical K-means implements a high level of abstraction - details are simply averaged out - combined with a very simple representation - all clusters are Gaussians in the original data space. We will see how approaches to subspace and deep clustering support high-dimensional and complex data by allowing richer representations. However, with increasing representational expressiveness comes the need to explicitly enforce abstraction in the objective function to ensure that the resulting method performs clustering and not just representation learning. We will see how current deep clustering methods define and enforce abstraction through centroid-based and density-based clustering losses. Balancing the conflicting goals of abstraction and representation is challenging. Ideas from subspace clustering help by learning one latent space for the information that is relevant to clustering and another latent space to capture all other information in the data.\n  The tutorial ends with an outlook on future research in clustering. Future methods will more adaptively balance abstraction and representation to improve performance, energy efficiency and interpretability. By automatically finding the sweet spot between abstraction and representation, the human brain is very good at clustering and other related tasks such as single-shot learning.

We hypothesize that an important factor in causing these hallucinations is the linearity of the relation: linear relations tend to be stored more abstractly, making it difficult for the LLM to assess its knowledge; the facts of nonlinear relations tend to be stored more directly, making knowledge assessment easier. To investigate this hypothesis, we create SyntHal, a dataset of 6000 synthetic entities for six relations. In our experiments with four models, we determine, for each relation, the hallucination rate on SyntHal and also measure its linearity, using $\u0394\\cos$. We find a strong correlation ($r \\in [.78,.82]$) between relational linearity and hallucination rate, providing evidence for our hypothesis that the underlying storage of triples of a relation is a factor in how well a model can self-assess its knowledge.

Accurately capturing these topological features often requires incorporating width-related information, including the thickness and length inherent to the image structures. However, traditional mathematical definitions of topological structures lack this dimensional width information, limiting methods like persistent homology from fully addressing practical segmentation needs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel mathematical framework that explicitly integrates width information into the characterization of topological structures. This method leverages persistent homology, complemented by smoothing concepts from partial differential equations (PDEs), to modify local extrema of upper-level sets. This approach enables the resulting topological structures to inherently capture width properties. We incorporate this enhanced topological description into variational image segmentation models. Using some proper loss functions, we are also able to design neural networks that can segment images with the required topological and width properties. Through variational constraints on the relevant topological energies, our approach successfully preserves essential topological invariants such as connectivity and genus counts, simultaneously ensuring that segmented structures retain critical width attributes, including line thickness and length.

To fill this critical gap, we systematically test the performance of DLMs within the RAG framework. Our findings reveal that DLMs coupled with RAG show promising potentials with stronger dependency on contextual information, but suffer from limited generation precision. We identify a key underlying issue: Response Semantic Drift (RSD), where the generated answer progressively deviates from the query's original semantics, leading to low precision content.

Existing approaches, typically based on parameter-shared autoregressive architectures, frequently lead to compromised performance in one or both tasks. To address this, we present UniX, a next-generation unified medical foundation model for chest X-ray understanding and generation. UniX decouples the two tasks into an autoregressive branch for understanding and a diffusion branch for high-fidelity generation. Crucially, a cross-modal self-attention mechanism is introduced to dynamically guide the generation process with understanding features. Coupled with a rigorous data cleaning pipeline and a multi-stage training strategy, this architecture enables synergistic collaboration between tasks while leveraging the strengths of diffusion models for superior generation. On two representative benchmarks, UniX achieves a 46.1% improvement in understanding performance (Micro-F1) and a 24.2% gain in generation quality (FD-RadDino), using only a quarter of the parameters of LLM-CXR. By achieving performance on par with task-specific models, our work establishes a scalable paradigm for synergistic medical image understanding and generation.

Graph-based Markov decision processes (GMDPs) capture such settings via an influence graph, but standard critics are poorly aligned with this structure: global value functions provide weak per-agent learning signals, while existing local constructions can be difficult to estimate and ill-behaved in infinite-horizon settings. We introduce the Diffusion Value Function (DVF), a factored value function for GMDPs that assigns to each agent a value component by diffusing rewards over the influence graph with temporal discounting and spatial attenuation. We show that DVF is well-defined, admits a Bellman fixed point, and decomposes the global discounted value via an averaging property. DVF can be used as a drop-in critic in standard RL algorithms and estimated scalably with graph neural networks. Building on DVF, we propose Diffusion A2C (DA2C) and a sparse message-passing actor, Learned DropEdge GNN (LD-GNN), for learning decentralised algorithms under communication costs. Across the firefighting benchmark and three distributed computation tasks (vector graph colouring and two transmit power optimisation problems), DA2C consistently outperforms local and global critic baselines, improving average reward by up to 11%.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We present a systematic stress-testing framework that probes failure modes of FNOs across five qualitatively different PDE families: dispersive, elliptic, multi-scale fluid, financial, and chaotic systems. Rather than optimizing in-distribution accuracy, we design controlled stress tests--including parameter shifts, boundary or terminal condition changes, resolution extrapolation with spectral analysis, and iterative rollouts--to expose vulnerabilities such as spectral bias, compounding integration errors, and overfitting to restricted boundary regimes. Our large-scale evaluation (1{,}000 trained models) reveals that distribution shifts in parameters or boundary conditions can inflate errors by more than an order of magnitude, while resolution changes primarily concentrate error in high-frequency modes. Input perturbations generally do not amplify error, though worst-case scenarios (e.g., localized Poisson perturbations) remain challenging.

Our models use between 2.89k and 6.17k FLOPs, including preprocessing and readout, which is three to six orders of magnitude less compared to SOTA methods. A novel preprocessing method is utilized that attains superior performance compared to existing methods for both the mixed-patient and inter-patient paradigms. In addition, a novel method for training the Lookup Tables (LUTs) in LUTNs is devised that uses the Boolean equation of a multiplexer (MUX). Additionally, rate coding was utilized for the first time in these LGNs and LUTNs, enhancing the performance of LGNs. Furthermore, it is the first time that LGNs and LUTNs have been benchmarked on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset using the inter-patient paradigm. Using an Artix 7 FPGA, between 2000 and 2990 LUTs were needed, and between 5 to 7 mW (i.e. 50 pJ to 70 pJ per inference) was estimated for running these models. The performance in terms of both accuracy and $j\u03ba$-index is significantly higher compared to previous LGN results.

We propose GenDA, a generative data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-resolution wind fields on unstructured meshes from limited observations. The model employs a multiscale graph-based diffusion architecture trained on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and interprets classifier-free guidance as a learned posterior reconstruction mechanism: the unconditional branch learns a geometry-aware flow prior, while the sensor-conditioned branch injects observational constraints during sampling. This formulation enables obstacle-aware reconstruction and generalization across unseen geometries, wind directions, and mesh resolutions without retraining. We consider both sparse fixed sensors and trajectory-based observations using the same reconstruction procedure. When evaluated against supervised graph neural network (GNN) baselines and classical reduced-order data assimilation methods, GenDA reduces the relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) by 25-57% and increases the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 23-33% across the tested meshes.

Although ensembling is a well-known way to improve supervised models, its application to unconditional score-based diffusion models remains largely unexplored. In this work we investigate whether it provides tangible benefits for generative modelling. We find that while ensembling the scores generally improves the score-matching loss and model likelihood, it fails to consistently enhance perceptual quality metrics such as FID on image datasets. We confirm this observation across a breadth of aggregation rules using Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout, on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ. We attempt to explain this discrepancy by investigating possible explanations, such as the link between score estimation and image quality. We also look into tabular data through random forests, and find that one aggregation strategy outperforms the others.

We propose \\textit{low-rank KV adaptation} (LRKV), a simple modification of multi-head attention that reduces KV cache memory by exploiting redundancy across attention heads while preserving full token-level resolution. Each layer uses a shared full-rank KV projection augmented with low-rank, head-specific residuals, yielding a continuous trade-off between complete sharing and fully independent attention.\n  LRKV is a drop-in replacement for standard multi-head attention and directly subsumes query-sharing approaches such as multi-query and grouped-query attention, while remaining distinct from latent-compression methods such as multi-latent attention (MLA). Across large-scale pretraining experiments, LRKV consistently achieves faster loss reduction, lower validation perplexity, and stronger downstream task performance than standard attention, MQA/GQA, and MLA. At the 2.5B scale, LRKV outperforms standard attention while using roughly half the KV cache, and reaches equivalent model quality with up to \\textbf{20-25\\% less training compute} when measured in cumulative FLOPs. To explain these gains, we analyze attention head structure in operator space and show that LRKV preserves nearly all functional head diversity relative to standard attention, whereas more aggressive KV-sharing mechanisms rely on compensatory query specialization.

Furthermore, traditional ML models are highly susceptible to adversarial manipulations, making them increasingly unreliable for real-world deployment. Quantum ML (QML) provides a unique advantage, utilizing quantum-enhanced feature representations to model the intricacies of the high-dimensional nature of smart grid systems while demonstrating greater resilience to adversarial manipulation. In this work, we propose QUPID, a partitioned quantum neural network (PQNN) that outperforms traditional state-of-the-art ML models in anomaly detection.

We propose several new probe architecture that handle this long-context distribution shift.\n  We evaluate these probes in the cyber-offensive domain, testing their robustness against various production-relevant shifts, including multi-turn conversations, static jailbreaks, and adaptive red teaming.
