While direct training methods tackle the challenge of\nnon-differentiable activation mechanisms in SNNs, they often suffer from high\ncomputational and energy costs during training. As a result, ANN-to-SNN\nconversion approach still remains a valuable and practical alternative. These\nconversion-based methods aim to leverage the discrete output produced by the\nquantization layer to obtain SNNs with low latency. Although the theoretical\nminimum latency is one timestep, existing conversion methods have struggled to\nrealize such ultra-low latency without accuracy loss. Moreover, current\nquantization approaches often discard negative-value information following\nbatch normalization and are highly sensitive to the hyperparameter\nconfiguration, leading to degraded performance. In this work, we, for the first\ntime, analyze the information loss introduced by quantization layers through\nthe lens of information entropy. Building on our analysis, we introduce\nPolarity Multi-Spike Mapping (PMSM) and a hyperparameter adjustment strategy\ntailored for the quantization layer. Our method achieves nearly lossless\nANN-to-SNN conversion at the extremity, i.e., the first timestep, while also\nleveraging the temporal dynamics of SNNs across multiple timesteps to maintain\nstable performance on complex tasks. Experimental results show that our PMSM\nachieves state-of-the-art accuracies of 98.5% on CIFAR-10, 89.3% on CIFAR-100\nand 81.6% on ImageNet with only one timestep on ViT-S architecture,\nestablishing a new benchmark for efficient conversion.

With the growing adoption of autonomous and\nconnected vehicles, the accurate estimation of safe speed at curves is becoming\nincreasingly important. The widely used AASHTO design method for safe curve\nspeed estimation relies on an analytical equation based on a simplified point\nmass model, which often uses conservative parameters to account for vehicular\nand environmental variations. This paper presents a digital twin-based\nframework for estimating safe speed at curves using a physics-driven virtual\nenvironment developed in the Unity engine. In this framework, a real-world\nhorizontal road curve is selected, and vehicle speed data are collected using a\nradar gun under various weather conditions. A 3D model of the road curve is\nconstructed in a Unity environment using roadway geometric and elevation data.\nA parameterized vehicle model is integrated, allowing for variations in mass,\nacceleration, and center of gravity to reflect different vehicle types and\nloading scenarios.

To date, most studies\nhave focused on systems with subsonic modulation, where the phase velocity of\nthe modulation wave is lower than that of the guided elastic waves. In\ncontrast, wave propagation under supersonic modulation remains largely\nunexplored, and the associated nonreciprocal phenomena present an open\nchallenge. In this work, we investigate the dynamic response of elastic\nlongitudinal waves propagating through a spatially bounded medium subjected to\nsupersonic modulation of its elastic properties. We show that supersonic\nmodulation gives rise to directional wavenumber bandgaps in the dispersion\ndiagram, characterized by vanishing wavenumbers. Using a theoretical framework\nbased on mode-coupling theory, we reveal how supersonic modulation governs\namplitude modulation and frequency conversion in wave transmission and\nreflection at spatial interfaces. This leads to nonreciprocal parametric\namplification and frequency conversion, phenomena not previously reported in\nbounded elastic media. Remarkably, the observed parametric amplification is not\ndriven by an imaginary component of the wavenumber, but instead arises from the\ninterference between counter-propagating Floquet-Bloch modes at spatial\ninterfaces.

In this paper, we propose PyloChain, a hierarchical sharded\nblockchain that balances availability and performance. PyloChain consists of\nmultiple lower-level local chains and one higher-level main chain. Each local\nchain speculatively executes local transactions to achieve high parallelism\nacross multiple local chains. The main chain leverages a directed-acyclic-graph\n(DAG)-based mempool to guarantee local block availability and to enable\nefficient Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus to execute global (or\ncross-shard) transactions within a collocated sharding. PyloChain speculatively\nexecutes local transactions across multiple local chains to achieve high\nparallelism. In order to reduce the number of aborted local transactions,\nPyloChain applies a simple scheduling technique to handle global transactions\nin the main chain. PyloChain provides a fine-grained auditing mechanism to\nmitigate faulty higher-level members by externalizing main chain operations to\nlower-level local members. We implemented and evaluated PyloChain,\ndemonstrating its performance scalability with 1.49x higher throughput and\n2.63x faster latency compared to the state-of-the-art balanced hierarchical\nsharded blockchain."}

Existing HOI generation approaches, such as\ndiffusion-based models, often suffer from artifacts such as implausible\ncontacts, penetrations, and unrealistic whole-body actions, which hinder\nsuccessful execution in physical environments. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce SimGenHOI, a unified framework that combines the strengths of\ngenerative modeling and reinforcement learning to produce controllable and\nphysically plausible HOI. Our HOI generative model, based on Diffusion\nTransformers (DiT), predicts a set of key actions conditioned on text prompts,\nobject geometry, sparse object waypoints, and the initial humanoid pose. These\nkey actions capture essential interaction dynamics and are interpolated into\nsmooth motion trajectories, naturally supporting long-horizon generation. To\nensure physical realism, we design a contact-aware whole-body control policy\ntrained with reinforcement learning, which tracks the generated motions while\ncorrecting artifacts such as penetration and foot sliding. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a mutual fine-tuning strategy, where the generative model and the\ncontrol policy iteratively refine each other, improving both motion realism and\ntracking robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimGenHOI generates\nrealistic, diverse, and physically plausible humanoid-object interactions,\nachieving significantly higher tracking success rates in simulation and\nenabling long-horizon manipulation tasks.

In the\nreal-parameter regime, the dynamical matrix is unitarily equivalent to four\ndecoupled copies of the sublattice-symmetric non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger\n(nSSH2) model, thereby inheriting its topological phases and energy\nspectrum-including the M\\\"obius phase, a gapless topological phase with\nfractional winding number, having no Hermitian counterpart. We show that the\ndynamics generated by the QBH Hamiltonian naturally reproduce non-Hermitian\ntime evolution, without invoking nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger dynamics or ad hoc\nnormalization. It is demonstrated by analytically calculating the Loschmidt\namplitude and computing the dynamical topological order parameter under\nperiodic boundary conditions, which displays a distinct chiral response in the\nM\\\"obius phase. In contrast, when the hopping and pairing terms are taken to be\npurely imaginary, the dynamical matrix becomes unitarily equivalent to a\ndifferent version of the sublattice-symmetric non-Hermitian\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger (nSSH1) model that supports only two topological phases:\ntrivial and non-trivial, and the M\\\"obius phase disappears. The latter system\nexhibits sublattice-dependent chiral amplification under open boundary\nconditions. We show that this amplification arises from the non-trivial\ntopology of the dynamical matrix, establishing a clear link between topological\nphase and amplification behavior in the imaginary-parameter regime."}

With Large Language Models (LLMs) recently\ndemonstrating impressive proficiency in Hardware Description Language (HDL)\ngeneration, it is promising to extend their abilities to 2.5D integration, an\nadvanced technique that saves area overhead and development costs. However,\nLLM-driven chiplet design faces challenges such as flatten design, high\nvalidation cost and imprecise parameter optimization, which limit its chiplet\ndesign capability. To address this, we propose MAHL, a hierarchical LLM-based\nchiplet design generation framework that features six agents which\ncollaboratively enable AI algorithm-hardware mapping, including hierarchical\ndescription generation, retrieval-augmented code generation, diverseflow-based\nvalidation, and multi-granularity design space exploration. These components\ntogether enhance the efficient generation of chiplet design with optimized\nPower, Performance and Area (PPA).

For years, robustness to such perturbations was pursued by\ntraining models from scratch (i.e., with random initializations) using\nspecialized loss objectives. Recently, robust fine-tuning has emerged as a more\nefficient alternative: instead of training from scratch, pretrained models are\nadapted to maximize predictive performance and robustness. To conduct robust\nfine-tuning, practitioners design an optimization strategy that includes the\nmodel update protocol (e.g., full or partial) and the specialized loss\nobjective. Additional design choices include the architecture type and size,\nand the pretrained representation.

To address\nthis, the Fixed Lagrange Multiplier (FLM) method is developed as an approximate\nanalytical tool, applicable to both two-level and higher-dimensional quantum\nsystems. Using quantum walks, a universal computation model, the study applies\nFLM to analyze and solve the SEA dynamics for single-component $N-$level\nsystems. The approximate FLM solutions show strong agreement with full\nnumerical simulations, particularly in regions of maximum entropy production\nconsistent with SEA predictions. To extend SEA analysis to composite systems,\nespecially two-qubit systems, the work provides a general framework for\n$N-$level Bloch vector parametrization.

Finally, the study examines\nthe no-signaling condition in nonlinear quantum theories. While nonlinearity\noften implies faster-than-light signaling, the SEA framework inherently\nrespects no-signaling. The equation of motion for both separable and entangled\n(e.g., Bell-diagonal) composites confirms that SEA maintains locality and\nprovides a robust foundation for modeling decoherence in both open and closed\nquantum systems.

To address these issues, a novel framework (DEXTER-LLM)\nfor dynamic task planning in unknown environments, integrates four modules: (i)\na mission comprehension module that resolves partial ordering of tasks\nspecified by natural languages or linear temporal logic formulas (LTL); (ii) an\nonline subtask generator based on LLMs that improves the accuracy and\nexplainability of task decomposition via multi-stage reasoning; (iii) an\noptimal subtask assigner and scheduler that allocates subtasks to robots via\nsearch-based optimization; and (iv) a dynamic adaptation and human-in-the-loop\nverification module that implements multi-rate, event-based updates for both\nsubtasks and their assignments, to cope with new features and tasks detected\nonline. The framework effectively combines LLMs' open-world reasoning\ncapabilities with the optimality of model-based assignment methods,\nsimultaneously addressing the critical issue of online adaptability and\nexplainability.

However, IoU-based losses fail to correctly update the\ngradient of small objects due to an extremely flat gradient. During the update\nof multiple objects, the learning of small objects' gradients suffers more\nbecause of insufficient gradient updates. Therefore, we propose an inter-class\nrelational loss to efficiently update the gradient of small objects while not\nsacrificing the learning efficiency of other objects based on the simple fact\nthat an object has a spatial relationship to another object (e.g., a car plate\nis attached to a car in a similar position). When the predicted car plate's\nbounding box is not within its car, a loss punishment is added to guide the\nlearning, which is inversely proportional to the overlapped area of the car's\nand predicted car plate's bounding box. By leveraging the spatial relationship\nat the inter-class level, the loss guides small object predictions using larger\nobjects and enhances latent information in deeper feature maps.

A promising quantum error-correcting code for\nlarge-scale quantum computing is the surface code. For this code,\nFault-Tolerant Quantum Computing (FTQC) can be performed via lattice surgery,\ni.e. merging and splitting of encoded qubit patches on a 2D grid. Lattice\nsurgery operations result in space-time patterns of activity that are defined\nin this work as access traces. This work demonstrates that the access traces\nreveal when, where, and how logical qubits interact. Leveraging this\nformulation, this work further introduces TraceQ, a trace-based reconstruction\nframework that is able to reconstruct the quantum circuit dataflow just by\nobserving the patch activity at each trace entry. The framework is supported by\nheuristics for handling inherent ambiguity in the traces, and demonstrates its\neffectiveness on a range of synthetic fault-tolerant quantum benchmarks. The\naccess traces can have applications in a wide range of scenarios, enabling\nanalysis and profiling of execution of quantum programs and the hardware they\nrun on. As one example use of TraceQ, this work investigates whether such\ntraces can act as a side channel through which an observer can recover the\ncircuit's structure and identify known subroutines in a larger program or even\nwhole programs. The findings show that indeed the minimal access traces can be\nused to recover subroutines or even whole quantum programs with very high\naccuracy.

In this work, we propose a novel prompt-based\ncalibration framework inspired by the Credence Calibration Game. Our method\nestablishes a structured interaction loop wherein LLMs receive feedback based\non the alignment of their predicted confidence with correctness.

We show that the\ndynamics generated by the QBH Hamiltonian naturally reproduce non-Hermitian\ntime evolution, without invoking nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger dynamics or ad hoc\nnormalization. It is demonstrated by analytically calculating the Loschmidt\namplitude and computing the dynamical topological order parameter under\nperiodic boundary conditions, which displays a distinct chiral response in the\nM\\\"obius phase. In contrast, when the hopping and pairing terms are taken to be\npurely imaginary, the dynamical matrix becomes unitarily equivalent to a\ndifferent version of the sublattice-symmetric non-Hermitian\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger (nSSH1) model that supports only two topological phases:\ntrivial and non-trivial, and the M\\\"obius phase disappears.

Automated\ntechnology has the potential to support the meat industry, assist workers, and\nenhance job quality.

Through a recently conducted survey of industry\nexperts, we identified two main challenges associated with integrating these\ncollaborative robots alongside human workers. First, there must be measures to\nensure the safety of human coworkers; second, the coworkers need to understand\nwhat the robot is doing. This paper addresses both challenges by introducing a\nsafety and transparency framework for general-purpose meat processing robots.\nFor safety, we implement a hand-detection system that continuously monitors\nnearby humans. This system can halt the robot in situations where the human\ncomes into close proximity of the operating robot. We also develop an\ninstrumented knife equipped with a force sensor that can differentiate contact\nbetween objects such as meat, bone, or fixtures.

To address these\nchallenges, we propose DEPTH, a framework that integrates Dependency-aware\nsEntence simPlification and Two-tiered Hierarchical refinement into the\nrelation extraction pipeline. Given a sentence and its candidate entity pairs,\nDEPTH operates in two stages: (1) the Grounding module extracts relations for\neach pair by leveraging their shortest dependency path, distilling the sentence\ninto a minimal yet coherent relational context that reduces syntactic noise\nwhile preserving key semantics; (2) the Refinement module aggregates all local\npredictions and revises them based on a holistic understanding of the sentence,\ncorrecting omissions and inconsistencies.

These approaches typically perform only a small\nnumber of message-passing rounds to learn the representations, which they then\nutilize for predictions. The small number of message-passing rounds comes at a\ncost, as the representations only capture local information and forego\nlong-range high-order dependencies.

It proposes a fine-tuning\nalgorithm framework based on knowledge graph injection. The method builds on\npretrained language models and introduces structured graph information for\nauxiliary learning. A graph neural network is used to encode entities and their\nrelations, constructing a graph-based semantic representation. A fusion\nmechanism is then designed to jointly model the knowledge graph embeddings with\nthe contextual representations from the language model. To enhance the\nrobustness of knowledge integration, a gating mechanism is introduced to\ndynamically balance the contributions of linguistic semantics and structural\nknowledge. This effectively mitigates conflicts between different\nrepresentational spaces. During training, a joint loss function is constructed\nto account for both task performance and structural alignment objectives. This\nhelps improve the accuracy of entity prediction and semantic reasoning. The\nstudy also includes a series of systematic sensitivity experiments. It\nevaluates the effects of learning rate, graph coverage, and structural\nperturbations on model performance. The results further validate the\neffectiveness and stability of the proposed method across tasks such as entity\nrecognition, question answering, and language generation. Experimental findings\nshow that the proposed structure-aware fine-tuning framework significantly\nenhances the model's ability to represent complex semantic units.

To address the lack\nof explainability of GNNs on KGs, recent works extract Datalog rules from GNNs\nwith provable correspondence guarantees. The extracted rules can be used to\nexplain the GNN's predictions; furthermore, they can help characterise the\nexpressive power of various GNN models. However, these works address only a\nform of link prediction based on a restricted, low-expressivity graph\nencoding/decoding method. In this paper, we consider a more general and popular\napproach for link prediction where a scoring function is used to decode the GNN\noutput into fact predictions. We show how GNNs and scoring functions can be\nadapted to be monotonic, use the monotonicity to extract sound rules for\nexplaining predictions, and leverage existing results about the kind of rules\nthat scoring functions can capture. We also define procedures for obtaining\nequivalent Datalog programs for certain classes of monotonic GNNs with scoring\nfunctions.

Consequently, these approaches are only effective under tightly\ncontrolled conditions, limiting their impact on real-world imaging. Here, we\npresent a quantum entanglement-based approach that transmits images through\ncomplex media without inverting the scattering process.

To address this, we propose an end-to-end\nEnergy-Regularized Information for Shift-Robustness (\\textbf{ERIS}) framework\nto enable guided and reliable feature disentanglement. The core idea is that\neffective disentanglement requires not only mathematical constraints but also\nsemantic guidance to anchor the separation process.

To address these challenges, we\nintroduce SimGenHOI, a unified framework that combines the strengths of\ngenerative modeling and reinforcement learning to produce controllable and\nphysically plausible HOI. Our HOI generative model, based on Diffusion\nTransformers (DiT), predicts a set of key actions conditioned on text prompts,\nobject geometry, sparse object waypoints, and the initial humanoid pose.

To\nensure physical realism, we design a contact-aware whole-body control policy\ntrained with reinforcement learning, which tracks the generated motions while\ncorrecting artifacts such as penetration and foot sliding. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a mutual fine-tuning strategy, where the generative model and the\ncontrol policy iteratively refine each other, improving both motion realism and\ntracking robustness.

This approach reframes cognitive\nsystems not as ergodic samplers, but as navigators over constrained latent\nmanifolds, guided by persistent topological memory. Through the lens of\ndelta-homology, we show that MAI provides a principled foundation for\nMountcastle's Universal Cortical Algorithm, modeling each cortical column as a\nlocal inference operator over cycle-consistent memory states. Furthermore, we\nestablish a time-reversal duality between MAI and reinforcement learning:\nwhereas RL propagates value forward from reward, MAI reconstructs latent causes\nbackward from memory. This inversion paves a path toward energy-efficient\ninference and addresses the computational bottlenecks facing modern AI. MAI\nthus offers a unified, biologically grounded theory of intelligence based on\nstructure, reuse, and memory. We also briefly discuss the profound implications\nof MAI for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI)."}

In doing so, our protocols reduce the average Bell pair\nstorage time compared to existing schemes, resulting in less cumulative noise\nas a direct consequence. On the theoretical side, our protocol design is\ngrounded in the structure of vertex covers in graph states up to local\ncomplementation. Through a comprehensive numerical evaluation, we compare the\nfidelities of delivered states with those of a baseline scheme, for state sizes\nup to n = 50 qubits. Simulations also show that our protocols can achieve the\ncritical fidelity threshold of 1/2 for multipartite entanglement in a wider\nrange of depolarization rates and success probabilities of Bell-pair\ngeneration. Overall, our protocols always achieve an equal or higher fidelity\nof the distributed state, and can reduce infidelity by up to 45%."}

However, such label-free CBMs often fail\nto localize concepts in relevant regions, attending to visually unrelated\nregions when predicting concept presence. To this end, we propose a framework,\ncoined Locality-aware Concept Bottleneck Model (LCBM), which utilizes rich\ninformation from foundation models and adopts prototype learning to ensure\naccurate spatial localization of the concepts. Specifically, we assign one\nprototype to each concept, promoted to represent a prototypical image feature\nof that concept.

In this\npaper, we introduce AIRL-S, the first natural unification of RL-based and\nsearch-based TTS. Central to AIRL-S is the insight that the reward function\nlearned during RL training inherently represents the ideal PRM for guiding\ndownstream search. Specifically, we leverage adversarial inverse reinforcement\nlearning (AIRL) combined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to\nlearn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces, entirely\neliminating the need for labeled intermediate process data. At inference, the\nresulting PRM simultaneously serves as the critic for RL rollouts and as a\nheuristic to effectively guide search procedures, facilitating robust reasoning\nchain extension, mitigating reward hacking, and enhancing cross-task\ngeneralization. Experimental results across eight benchmarks, including\nmathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation, demonstrate that our\nunified approach improves performance by 9 % on average over the base model,\nmatching GPT-4o. Furthermore, when integrated into multiple search algorithms,\nour PRM consistently outperforms all baseline PRMs trained with labeled data.\nThese results underscore that, indeed, your reward function for RL is your best\nPRM for search, providing a robust and cost-effective solution to complex\nreasoning tasks in LLMs."}

While large language models (LLMs) have shown great\npromise in this domain, most existing methods concentrate on relation\nclassification, which predicts the semantic relation type between a related\nentity pair. However, we observe that LLMs often struggle to reliably determine\nwhether a relation exists, especially in cases involving complex sentence\nstructures or intricate semantics, which leads to spurious predictions. Such\nhallucinations can introduce noisy edges in knowledge graphs, compromising the\nintegrity of structured knowledge and downstream reliability. To address these\nchallenges, we propose DEPTH, a framework that integrates Dependency-aware\nsEntence simPlification and Two-tiered Hierarchical refinement into the\nrelation extraction pipeline. Given a sentence and its candidate entity pairs,\nDEPTH operates in two stages: (1) the Grounding module extracts relations for\neach pair by leveraging their shortest dependency path, distilling the sentence\ninto a minimal yet coherent relational context that reduces syntactic noise\nwhile preserving key semantics; (2) the Refinement module aggregates all local\npredictions and revises them based on a holistic understanding of the sentence,\ncorrecting omissions and inconsistencies. We further introduce a\ncausality-driven reward model that mitigates reward hacking by disentangling\nspurious correlations, enabling robust fine-tuning via reinforcement learning\nwith human feedback.

A key\nchallenge in LLM inference scheduling is that while the prompt length is known\nupon arrival, the output length, which critically impacts memory usage and\nprocessing time, is unknown.

This\npaper presents PB-IAD (Prompt-based Industrial Anomaly Detection), a novel\nframework that leverages the multimodal and reasoning capabilities of\nfoundation models for industrial anomaly detection.

This user-centric design allows domain\nexperts to customise the system flexibly without requiring data science\nexpertise. The proposed framework is evaluated by utilizing GPT-4.1 across\nthree distinct manufacturing scenarios, two data modalities, and an ablation\nstudy to systematically assess the contribution of semantic instructions.\nFurthermore, PB-IAD is benchmarked to state-of-the-art methods for anomaly\ndetection such as PatchCore.

Leveraging Virtual Community, we propose two\nnovel challenges. The Community Planning Challenge evaluates multi-agent\nreasoning and planning ability in open-world settings, such as cooperating to\nhelp agents with daily activities and efficiently connecting other agents. The\nCommunity Robot Challenge requires multiple heterogeneous robots to collaborate\nin solving complex open-world tasks. We evaluate various baselines on these\ntasks and demonstrate the challenges in both high-level open-world task\nplanning and low-level cooperation controls. We hope that Virtual Community\nwill unlock further study of human-robot coexistence within open-world\nenvironments."}

The fundamental challenge\nof ACIL lies in the unavoidable mismatch of occupancy measure between the\nexpert and the imitator caused by the action constraints. We tackle this\nmismatch through \\textit{trajectory alignment} and propose DTWIL, which\nreplaces the original expert demonstrations with a surrogate dataset that\nfollows similar state trajectories while adhering to the action constraints.\nSpecifically, we recast trajectory alignment as a planning problem and solve it\nvia Model Predictive Control, which aligns the surrogate trajectories with the\nexpert trajectories based on the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance. Through\nextensive experiments, we demonstrate that learning from the dataset generated\nby DTWIL significantly enhances performance across multiple robot control tasks\nand outperforms various benchmark imitation learning algorithms in terms of\nsample efficiency.

In this paper, we propose enhancing IL performance under limited\nexpert data by introducing a pre-training stage that learns dynamics\nrepresentations, derived from factorizations of the transition dynamics. We\nfirst theoretically justify that the optimal decision variable of offline IL\nlies in the representation space, significantly reducing the parameters to\nlearn in the downstream IL. Moreover, the dynamics representations can be\nlearned from arbitrary data collected with the same dynamics, allowing the\nreuse of massive non-expert data and mitigating the limited data issues. We\npresent a tractable loss function inspired by noise contrastive estimation to\nlearn the dynamics representations at the pre-training stage. Experiments on\nMuJoCo demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can mimic expert policies with\nas few as a single trajectory. Experiments on real quadrupeds show that we can\nleverage pre-trained dynamics representations from simulator data to learn to\nwalk from a few real-world demonstrations."}

To improve robustness to such\nvariations, we propose two enhancements to the standard Progressive\nTransformers (PT) architecture (Saunders et al., 2020). First, we encode poses\nusing bone rotations in quaternion space and train with a geodesic loss to\nimprove the accuracy and clarity of angular joint movements. Second, we\nintroduce a contrastive loss to structure decoder embeddings by semantic\nsimilarity, using either gloss overlap or SBERT-based sentence similarity,\naiming to filter out anatomical and stylistic features that do not convey\nrelevant semantic information. On the Phoenix14T dataset, the contrastive loss\nalone yields a 16% improvement in Probability of Correct Keypoint over the PT\nbaseline. When combined with quaternion-based pose encoding, the model achieves\na 6% reduction in Mean Bone Angle Error.

These sensory-rich modalities are beyond\nthe scope of conventional LLMs. To address these challenges, we present\nShizhenGPT, the first multimodal LLM tailored for TCM. To overcome data\nscarcity, we curate the largest TCM dataset to date, comprising 100GB+ of text\nand 200GB+ of multimodal data, including 1.2M images, 200 hours of audio, and\nphysiological signals. ShizhenGPT is pretrained and instruction-tuned to\nachieve deep TCM knowledge and multimodal reasoning. For evaluation, we collect\nrecent national TCM qualification exams and build a visual benchmark for\nMedicinal Recognition and Visual Diagnosis. Experiments demonstrate that\nShizhenGPT outperforms comparable-scale LLMs and competes with larger\nproprietary models. Moreover, it leads in TCM visual understanding among\nexisting multimodal LLMs and demonstrates unified perception across modalities\nlike sound, pulse, smell, and vision, paving the way toward holistic multimodal\nperception and diagnosis in TCM.

First, the efficacy of using English as a pivot\nlanguage varies by language: it provides no benefit for French, improves\nperformance when used as the reasoning language for Japanese and Latvian, and\nproves insufficient for Swahili where both task comprehension and reasoning\nremain poor. Second, extensive multilingual pretraining in Qwen 3 narrows but\ndoes not eliminate the cross-lingual performance gap.
