Distributed models are generally produced by programmers who take a\nsequential model specification and apply several distribution strategies to\ndistribute state and computation across GPUs. Unfortunately, bugs can be\nintroduced in the process, and a distributed model implementation's outputs\nmight differ from the sequential model's outputs.

More\nprecisely, we show that every externality budget achievable by any feasible\nflow in the network can also be achieved as a Wardrop equilibrium by setting\nappropriate prices. For extremal and Pareto-minimal budgets, we show that there\nare prices such that all equilibria respect the budgets. Although the proofs of\nexistence of these particular prices rely on fixed-point arguments and are\nnon-constructive, we show that in the case where the equilibrium minimizes a\nconvex potential, the prices can be obtained as Lagrange multipliers of a\nsuitable convex program. In the case of a single externality, we prove that the\ntotal externality caused by the traffic flow is decreasing in the price. For\nincreasing, continuous, and piecewise affine travel time functions with a\nsingle externality, we give an output-polynomial algorithm that computes all\nequilibria implementable by pricing the externality.

We\npresent the core mechanisms and key design principles behind GenCom, which\nshifts from conventional approaches toward simple semantic-preserving\ncompression, weak error-distribution codes, and semantic-aware retransmissions.\nThrough a case study, GenCom is shown to deliver robust performance across a\nwide range of low and uncertain SNR/SINR conditions where conventional systems\nfail. Finally, we outline critical challenges and research directions toward\nmaking GenCom a practical enabler of future human-centric, intelligent, and\nsustainable wireless networks."}

Existing methods either address unobserved\nconfounders while ignoring the simultaneous feedback, or account for feedback\nbut under restrictive linear assumptions, thus failing to obtain accurate peer\neffect estimation. In this paper, we propose DIG2RSI, a novel Deep learning\nframework which leverages I-G transformation (matrix operation) and 2SRI (an\ninstrumental variable or IV technique) to address both simultaneous feedback\nand unobserved confounding, while accommodating complex, nonlinear and\nhigh-dimensional relationships. DIG2RSI first applies the I-G transformation to\ndisentangle mutual peer influences and eliminate the bias due to the\nsimultaneous feedback. To deal with unobserved confounding, we first construct\nvalid IVs from network data. In stage 1 of 2RSI, we train a neural network on\nthese IVs to predict peer exposure, and extract residuals as proxies for the\nunobserved confounders. In the stage 2, we fit a separate neural network\naugmented by an adversarial discriminator that incorporates these residuals as\na control function and enforces the learned representation to contain no\nresidual confounding signal. The expressive power of deep learning models in\ncapturing complex non-linear relationships and adversarial debiasing enhances\nthe effectiveness of DIG2RSI in eliminating bias from both feedback loops and\nhidden confounders. We prove consistency of our estimator under standard\nregularity conditions, ensuring asymptotic recovery of the true peer effect.\nEmpirical results on two semi-synthetic benchmarks and a real-world dataset\ndemonstrate that DIG2RSI outperforms existing approaches."}

However, deep FER models often struggle with subtle\nexpressions and high inter-subject variability, limiting their performance in\nreal-world applications. To improve their performance, source-free domain\nadaptation (SFDA) methods have been proposed to personalize a pretrained source\nmodel using only unlabeled target domain data, thereby avoiding data privacy,\nstorage, and transmission constraints. This paper addresses a challenging\nscenario where source data is unavailable for adaptation, and only unlabeled\ntarget data consisting solely of neutral expressions is available. SFDA methods\nare not typically designed to adapt using target data from only a single class.\nFurther, using models to generate facial images with non-neutral expressions\ncan be unstable and computationally intensive. In this paper, personalized\nfeature translation (PFT) is proposed for SFDA. Unlike current image\ntranslation methods for SFDA, our lightweight method operates in the latent\nspace.

In a substantial empirical study, we reveal a structural trade-off:\nhighly on-topic prompts are frequently blocked by safety filters, whereas those\nthat are too OOD often evade detection but fail to produce harmful content.\nHowever, prompts that balance relevance and novelty are more likely to evade\nfilters and trigger dangerous output. Building on this insight, we develop a\nrecursive rewriting strategy called Balanced Structural Decomposition (BSD).\nThe approach restructures malicious prompts into semantically aligned\nsub-tasks, while introducing subtle OOD signals and visual cues that make the\ninputs harder to detect. BSD was tested across 13 commercial and open-source\nMLLMs, where it consistently led to higher attack success rates, more harmful\noutputs, and fewer refusals. Compared to previous methods, it improves success\nrates by $67\\%$ and harmfulness by $21\\%$, revealing a previously\nunderappreciated weakness in current multimodal safety systems."}

However, existing approaches manifest two critical\nlimitations in complex scenarios: (1) Over-reconstruction occurs when\npersistent large Gaussians cannot meet adaptive splitting thresholds during\ndensity control. This is exacerbated by conflicting gradient directions that\nprevent effective splitting of these Gaussians; (2) Over-densification of\nGaussians occurs in regions with aligned gradient aggregation, leading to\nredundant component proliferation. This redundancy significantly increases\nmemory overhead due to unnecessary data retention. We present\nGradient-Direction-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GDAGS), a gradient-direction-aware\nadaptive density control framework to address these challenges. Our key\ninnovations: the gradient coherence ratio (GCR), computed through normalized\ngradient vector norms, which explicitly discriminates Gaussians with concordant\nversus conflicting gradient directions; and a nonlinear dynamic weighting\nmechanism leverages the GCR to enable gradient-direction-aware density control.\nSpecifically, GDAGS prioritizes conflicting-gradient Gaussians during splitting\noperations to enhance geometric details while suppressing redundant\nconcordant-direction Gaussians. Conversely, in cloning processes, GDAGS\npromotes concordant-direction Gaussian densification for structural completion\nwhile preventing conflicting-direction Gaussian overpopulation.

Although most methods\nutilize techniques to estimate grasp pose by treating the problem via pure\nsampling-based approaches in the six-degree-of-freedom space or as a learning\nproblem, they usually fail in real-life settings owing to poor generalization\nacross domains. In addition, the time taken to generate the grasp plan and the\nlack of repeatability, owing to sampling inefficiency and the probabilistic\nnature of existing grasp planning approaches, severely limits their application\nin real-world tasks. This paper presents a lightweight analytical approach\ntowards robotic grasp planning, particularly antipodal grasps, with little to\nno sampling in the six-degree-of-freedom space. The proposed grasp planning\nalgorithm is formulated as an optimization problem towards estimating grasp\npoints on the object surface instead of directly estimating the end-effector\npose. To this extent, a soft-region-growing algorithm is presented for\neffective plane segmentation, even in the case of curved surfaces. An\noptimization-based quality metric is then used for the evaluation of grasp\npoints to ensure indirect force closure. The proposed grasp framework is\ncompared with the existing state-of-the-art grasp planning approach, Grasp pose\ndetection (GPD), as a baseline over multiple simulated objects. The\neffectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison to GPD is also evaluated\nin a real-world setting using image and point-cloud data, with the planned\ngrasps being executed using a ROBOTIQ gripper and UR5 manipulator."}

It is a fundamental problem in\nagent-based modeling (ABM), which has become the standard to analyze\nintelligent transportation systems. The synthetic population serves as the\nprimary input for ABM transportation simulation, with traveling agents\nrepresented by population members. However, when the number of attributes\ndescribing agents becomes large, survey data often cannot densely support the\njoint distribution of the attributes in the population due to the curse of\ndimensionality. This sparsity makes it difficult to accurately model and\nproduce the population. Interestingly, deep generative models trained from\navailable sample data can potentially synthesize possible attribute\ncombinations that present in the actual population but do not exist in the\nsample data(called sampling zeros). Nevertheless, this comes at the cost of\nfalsely generating the infeasible attribute combinations that do not exist in\nthe population (called structural zeros).

The results demonstrate that the azimuthal\nangle has no observable effect. For collinear magnetization, the topological\nbandgap decreases as the spin orientation approaches the in-plane direction.

This framework combines\nwhole-body bilateral teleoperation with an online multi-stage object inertial\nparameter estimation module, which is the core technical contribution of this\nwork. The multi-stage process sequentially integrates a vision-based object\nsize estimator, an initial parameter guess generated by a large vision-language\nmodel (VLM), and a decoupled hierarchical sampling strategy. The visual size\nestimate and VLM prior offer a strong initial guess of the object's inertial\nparameters, significantly reducing the search space for sampling-based\nrefinement and improving the overall estimation speed. A hierarchical strategy\nfirst estimates mass and center of mass, then infers inertia from object size\nto ensure physically feasible parameters, while a decoupled multi-hypothesis\nscheme enhances robustness to VLM prior errors. Our estimator operates in\nparallel with high-fidelity simulation and hardware, enabling real-time online\nupdates. The estimated parameters are then used to update the wheeled\nhumanoid's equilibrium point, allowing the operator to focus more on locomotion\nand manipulation.

We apply this method to various physically\nrelevant channel models, including general Pauli channels, the dephrasure\nchannel, the generalized amplitude damping channel, and the damping-dephasing\nchannel.

We propose an adaptive trigger generator that\nembeds the semantic information of the attack target's description into the\noriginal image using a text-conditional U-Net, thereby overcoming the\nopen-vocabulary attack challenge. To ensure the attack's stealthiness, we\nutilize a reconstruction loss to minimize visual discrepancies between poisoned\nand clean images. Additionally, we introduce a unified method for generating\nattack data. IAG is evaluated theoretically and empirically, demonstrating its\nfeasibility and effectiveness. Notably, our ASR@0.5 on InternVL-2.5-8B reaches\nover 65\\% on various testing sets. IAG also shows promising potential on\nmanipulating Ferret-7B and LlaVA-1.5-7B with very little accuracy decrease on\nclean samples. Extensive specific experiments, such as ablation study and\npotential defense, also indicate the robustness and transferability of our\nattack."}

This issue is particularly\nprevalent in complex real-world scenes, where the true number of planes is\nunknown and multiple planes coexist. In this paper, we aim to address this\nlimitation by proposing a generalised framework for plane detection based on\nmodel information optimization. Building on previous works, we treat the\nobserved depth readings as discrete random variables, with their probability\ndistributions constrained by the ground truth planes. Various models containing\ndifferent candidate plane constraints are then generated through repeated\nrandom sub-sampling to explain our observations. By incorporating the physics\nand noise model of the depth sensor, we can calculate the information for each\nmodel, and the model with the least information is accepted as the most likely\nground truth. This information optimization process serves as an objective\nmechanism for determining the true number of planes and preventing false\npositive detections.

Accurate identification of\nstandard fetal torso planes is essential for reliable assessment and\npersonalized prenatal care. However, limitations such as low contrast and\nunclear texture details in ultrasound imaging pose significant challenges for\nfine-grained anatomical recognition. Methods: We propose a novel Multi-Contrast\nFusion Module (MCFM) to enhance the model's ability to extract detailed\ninformation from ultrasound images. MCFM operates exclusively on the lower\nlayers of the neural network, directly processing raw ultrasound data. By\nassigning attention weights to image representations under different contrast\nconditions, the module enhances feature modeling while explicitly maintaining\nminimal parameter overhead. Results: The proposed MCFM was evaluated on a\ncurated dataset of fetal torso plane ultrasound images. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that MCFM substantially improves recognition performance, with a\nminimal increase in model complexity. The integration of multi-contrast\nattention enables the model to better capture subtle anatomical structures,\ncontributing to higher classification accuracy and clinical reliability.\nConclusions: Our method provides an effective solution for improving fetal\ntorso plane recognition in ultrasound imaging.

Unlike typical\nknowledge distillation frameworks, which use a complex teacher to guide a\nsimpler student, HyperKD enables an inverse form of knowledge transfer across\ndifferent types of spectral data, guided by a simpler teacher model.

LIA-X is an autoencoder that models motion transfer as a\nlinear navigation of motion codes in latent space. Crucially, it incorporates a\nnovel Sparse Motion Dictionary that enables the model to disentangle facial\ndynamics into interpretable factors. Deviating from previous 'warp-render'\napproaches, the interpretability of the Sparse Motion Dictionary allows LIA-X\nto support a highly controllable 'edit-warp-render' strategy, enabling precise\nmanipulation of fine-grained facial semantics in the source portrait. This\nhelps to narrow initial differences with the driving video in terms of pose and\nexpression. Moreover, we demonstrate the scalability of LIA-X by successfully\ntraining a large-scale model with approximately 1 billion parameters on\nextensive datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed method\noutperforms previous approaches in both self-reenactment and cross-reenactment\ntasks across several benchmarks. Additionally, the interpretable and\ncontrollable nature of LIA-X supports practical applications such as\nfine-grained, user-guided image and video editing, as well as 3D-aware portrait\nvideo manipulation."}

Our\npipeline consists of three key modules: a raylet feature extractor, a raylet\ndistance field predictor, and a multi-raylet blender. These components work\ntogether to extract fine-grained local geometric features, predict raylet\ndistances, and aggregate multiple predictions to reconstruct precise surface\npoints. We extensively evaluate our method on multiple public real-world\ndatasets, demonstrating superior performance in surface reconstruction from\npoint clouds or 3D Gaussians. Most notably, our method achieves exceptional\ngeneralization ability, successfully recovering 3D surfaces in a single-forward\npass across unseen datasets in testing."}

However, some tasks (i.e., queries) may be too specialized\nand difficult for a single LLM to handle alone. These applications often\nbenefit from breaking down the task into smaller subtasks, each of which can\nthen be executed by a LLM expected to perform well on that specific subtask.\nFor example, in extracting a diagnosis from medical records, one can first\nselect an LLM to summarize the record, select another to validate the summary,\nand then select another, possibly different, LLM to extract the diagnosis from\nthe summarized record. Unlike existing LLM selection or routing algorithms,\nthis setting requires that we select a sequence of LLMs, with the output of\neach LLM feeding into the next and potentially influencing its success.

Despite the improvements of\nthis approach, an important limitation emerges: the substantial increase in\ncomputation time makes the process slow and impractical for many applications.\nGiven the success of this paradigm and its growing usage, we seek to preserve\nits benefits while eschewing the inference overhead. In this work we propose\none solution to the critical problem of integrating test-time scaling knowledge\ninto a model during post-training. Specifically, we replace reward guided\ntest-time noise optimization in diffusion models with a Noise Hypernetwork that\nmodulates initial input noise. We propose a theoretically grounded framework\nfor learning this reward-tilted distribution for distilled generators, through\na tractable noise-space objective that maintains fidelity to the base model\nwhile optimizing for desired characteristics. We show that our approach\nrecovers a substantial portion of the quality gains from explicit test-time\noptimization at a fraction of the computational cost.
