However, obtaining high-quality\nmeshes of engineering microstructures using these approaches remains an open\nquestion. In harmonic approaches, we usually reconstruct surfaces by evaluating\nthe harmonic bases on equidistantly sampled simplicial complexes of the base\ndomains (e.g., triangular spheroids and disks). However, this traditional\nsampling does not account for local changes in the Jacobian of the basis\nfunctions, resulting in nonuniform discretization after reconstruction or\ngeneration. As it impacts the accuracy and time step, high-quality\ndiscretization of microstructures is crucial for efficient numerical\nsimulations (e.g., finite element and discrete element methods). To circumvent\nthis issue, we propose an efficient hierarchical diffusion-based approach for\nresampling the surface-i.e., performing a reparameterization-to yield an\nequalized mesh triangulation. Analogous to heat problems, we use nonlinear\ndiffusion to resample the curvilinear coordinates of the analysis domain,\nthereby enlarging small triangles at the expense of large triangles on\nsurfaces. We tested isotropic and anisotropic diffusion schemes on the recent\nspheroidal and hemispheroidal harmonics methods. The results show a substantial\nimprovement in the quality metrics for surface triangulation. Unlike\ntraditional surface reconstruction and meshing techniques, this approach\npreserves surface morphology, along with the areas and volumes of surfaces. We\ndiscuss the results and the associated computational costs for large 2D and 3D\nmicrostructures, such as digital twins of concrete and stone masonry, and their\nfuture applications."}

Traditional\ndisplay measurement methods based on sparse radiometric sampling and fitting a\nmodel are inadequate for capturing spatially varying display artifacts, as they\nfail to capture high-frequency and pixel-level distortions. While cameras offer\nsufficient spatial resolution, they introduce optical, sampling, and\nphotometric distortions. Furthermore, the physical measurement must be combined\nwith a model of a visual system to assess whether the distortions are going to\nbe visible. To enable perceptual assessment of displays, we propose a\ncombination of a camera-based reconstruction pipeline with a visual difference\npredictor, which account for both the inaccuracy of camera measurements and\nvisual difference prediction. The reconstruction pipeline combines HDR image\nstacking, MTF inversion, vignetting correction, geometric undistortion,\nhomography transformation, and color correction, enabling cameras to function\nas precise display measurement instruments. By incorporating a Visual\nDifference Predictor (VDP), our system models the visibility of various stimuli\nunder different viewing conditions for the human visual system.

Integrated with modern AI techniques, game-theoretic\nmodels enable the design and optimization of strategies across multiple levels\nof cyber warfare, from policy and strategy to operations, tactics, and\ntechnical implementations. These models capture the paradoxical logic of\nconflict, where more resources do not always translate into greater advantage,\nand where nonlinear dynamics govern outcomes. To illustrate the approach, this\nchapter examines RedCyber, a synthetic cyber conflict, demonstrating how\ngame-theoretic methods capture the interdependencies of cyber operations. The\nchapter concludes with directions for future research on resilience,\ncros-echelon planning, and the evolving role of AI in cyber warfare."}

The RIME algorithm is a recently proposed physical-based\nmetaheuristic algorithm with certain advantages. However, it suffers from rapid\nloss of population diversity during optimization and is prone to fall into\nlocal optima, leading to unbalanced exploitation and exploration. To address\nthe shortcomings of RIME, this paper proposes a modified RIME with covariance\nlearning and diversity enhancement (MRIME-CD). The algorithm applies three\nstrategies to improve the optimization capability. First, a covariance learning\nstrategy is introduced in the soft-rime search stage to increase the population\ndiversity and balance the over-exploitation ability of RIME through the\nbootstrapping effect of dominant populations. Second, in order to moderate the\ntendency of RIME population to approach the optimal individual in the early\nsearch stage, an average bootstrapping strategy is introduced into the\nhard-rime puncture mechanism, which guides the population search through the\nweighted position of the dominant populations, thus enhancing the global search\nability of RIME in the early stage. Finally, a new stagnation indicator is\nproposed, and a stochastic covariance learning strategy is used to update the\nstagnant individuals in the population when the algorithm gets stagnant, thus\nenhancing the ability to jump out of the local optimal solution. The proposed\nMRIME-CD algorithm is subjected to a series of validations on the CEC2017 test\nset, the CEC2022 test set, and the experimental results are analyzed using the\nFriedman test, the Wilcoxon rank sum test, and the Kruskal Wallis test. The\nresults show that MRIME-CD can effectively improve the performance of basic\nRIME and has obvious superiorities in terms of solution accuracy, convergence\nspeed and stability."}

The\nmodeling process comprises two stages: obtaining contextual scores and\nperforming psychometric analysis.

These systems are\nwidely studied across various fields, including neuroscience, ecology,\nepidemiology, and several other subject areas that deal with emergent dynamics.\nA current challenge in the discovery process relates to system identification\nwhen there is no prior knowledge of the underlying physics. We attempt to\naddress this challenge by learning Soft Artificial Life (Soft ALife) models,\nsuch as Agent-based and Cellular Automata (CA) models, from observed data for\nreaction-diffusion systems. In this paper, we present findings on the\napplicability of a conceptual framework, the Data-driven Rulesets for Soft\nArtificial Life (DRSALife) model, to learn Soft ALife rulesets that accurately\nrepresent emergent dynamics in a reaction-diffusion system from observed data.\nThis model has demonstrated promising results for Elementary CA Rule 30, Game\nof Life, and Vicsek Flocking problems in recent work. To our knowledge, this is\none of the few studies that explore machine-based Soft ALife ruleset learning\nand system identification for reaction-diffusion dynamics without any prior\nknowledge of the underlying physics. Moreover, we provide comprehensive\nfindings from experiments investigating the potential effects of using noisy\nand sparse observed datasets on learning emergent dynamics. Additionally, we\nsuccessfully identify the structure and parameters of the underlying partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs) representing these dynamics.

Task graph\nmodeling provides a structured way to capture such dependencies and serves as\nthe foundation for many system-level design strategies. However, these\nstrategies typically rely on predefined task graphs, while many real-world\napplications lack explicit graphs and exhibit dynamic, data-dependent behavior,\nlimiting the effectiveness of static approaches. To address this, several task\ngraph modeling methods for realistic workloads have been developed. Yet, they\neither rely on implicit techniques that use application-specific features\nwithout producing explicit graphs, or they generate graphs tailored to fixed\nscheduling models, which limits generality. More importantly, they often\noverlook coherence interactions, creating a gap between design assumptions and\nactual runtime behavior. To overcome these limitations, we propose CoTAM, a\nCoherence-Aware Task Graph Modeling framework for realistic workloads that\nconstructs a unified task graph reflecting runtime behavior. CoTAM analyzes the\nimpact of coherence by decoupling its effects from overall execution,\nquantifies its influence through a learned weighting scheme, and infers\ninter-task dependencies for coherence-aware graph generation.

In the SC regime, we find that the self-Kerr\nnonlinearity generates a frequency shift and reduces the coherent magnon-photon\ncoupling. In contrast, in the USC regime, we find that the coherent\nmagnon-photon coupling not only overcomes the self-Kerr nonlinearity but also\neffectively couples to gain via the imaginary part of complex eigenfrequencies,\nresulting in magnon-like auto-oscillations. Subsequently, the USC enables one\nto widely tune the auto-oscillation frequency by means of an external magnetic\nfield. These findings indicate that there is a trade-off relation between the\ncoupling strength of MPs and the self-Kerr nonlinearity of magnons.

However, straggling edge nodes (stragglers)\nsignificantly degrade the performance of MEC systems by prolonging computation\nlatency. While coded distributed computing (CDC) as an effective technique is\nwidely adopted to mitigate straggler effects, existing CDC schemes exhibit two\ncritical limitations: (i) They cannot successfully decode the final result\nunless the number of received results reaches a fixed recovery threshold, which\nseriously restricts their flexibility; (ii) They suffer from inherent poles in\ntheir encoding/decoding functions, leading to decoding inaccuracies and\nnumerical instability in the computational results. To address these\nlimitations, this paper proposes an approximated CDC scheme based on\nbarycentric rational interpolation. The proposed CDC scheme offers several\noutstanding advantages. Firstly, it can decode the final result leveraging any\nreturned results from workers. Secondly, it supports computations over both\nfinite and real fields while ensuring numerical stability. Thirdly, its\nencoding/decoding functions are free of poles, which not only enhances\napproximation accuracy but also achieves flexible accuracy tuning.

We then examine the performance trade-offs of\nsuch scheduling which stem from statistical heterogeneity among clients,\nselection bias in participation, and temporal correlation in model updates. To\nleverage these trade-offs, we construct a carbon-aware scheduler that\nintegrates slack time, $\\alpha$-fair carbon allocation, and a global\nfine-tuning phase. Experiments on real-world CI data show that our scheduler\noutperforms slack-agnostic baselines, achieving higher model accuracy across a\nwide range of carbon budgets, with especially strong gains under tight carbon\nconstraints."}

(2) an Embodiment-Aware\nReasoning framework that jointly incorporates task goals and embodiment\nconstraints into the reasoning loop, resulting in planning decisions that are\nboth goal-directed and executable. Extensive experimental results demonstrate\nthat OmniEVA not only achieves state-of-the-art general embodied reasoning\nperformance, but also exhibits a strong ability across a wide range of\ndownstream scenarios. Evaluations of a suite of proposed embodied benchmarks,\nincluding both primitive and composite tasks, confirm its robust and versatile\nplanning capabilities.

Through\nnumerical experiments on spin Hamiltonians arranged in periodic lattice\nconfigurations and Majorana Hamiltonians, we demonstrate that the twin-collapse\nincreases the identification of simplicial and claw-free graph structures,\nwhich characterize free-fermion solvability. Finally, we extend our framework\nby presenting a generalized discrete Stone-von Neumann theorem.

A key methodological contribution is\nthe integration of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) common-sense through a layered\nreward function. The VLM query is modeled as a dedicated action, allowing the\nagent to strategically query the VLM only when deemed necessary for gaining\nexternal guidance, thereby conserving resources.

Experiments with three LLMs and\ntwo benchmark datasets show that the confidence produced by GrACE achieves the\nbest discriminative capacity and calibration on open-ended generation tasks,\noutperforming six competing methods without resorting to additional sampling or\nan auxiliary model. Moreover, we propose two strategies for improving test-time\nscaling based on confidence induced by GrACE. Experimental results show that\nusing GrACE not only improves the accuracy of the final decision but also\nsignificantly reduces the number of required samples in the test-time scaling\nscheme, indicating the potential of GrACE as a practical solution for deploying\nLLMs with scalable, reliable, and real-time confidence estimation."}

The benchmarking results reveal the limitations of current AI detection\nmethods under real-world conditions and underscore the importance of drawing on\nhuman adaptability to develop more robust detection algorithms."}

We evaluate whether LLMs can produce SCEs that\nare valid, achieving the intended outcome, and minimal, modifying the input no\nmore than necessary.

In this paper,\nwe propose Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) that enhances temporal\nawareness in MLLMs through the Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and a\nsemantically guided Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy.\nSpecifically, we interleave video frame embeddings with textual timestamp\ntokens to construct a continuous temporal reference system. We further\nreformulate the video sampling problem as a vision-language retrieval task and\nintroduce a two-stage algorithm to ensure both semantic relevance and temporal\ncoverage: enriching each query into a descriptive caption to better align with\nthe vision feature, and sampling key event with a similarity-driven temporally\nregularized greedy strategy. Our method achieves remarkable improvements w.r.t.\nabsolute time understanding and key event localization, resulting in\nstate-of-the-art performance among 7B and 72B models on hour-long video\nbenchmarks.

Prior approaches face critical limitations: some\nrely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined\ntoolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single\nreasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate\nsteps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the\nuse of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address\nthis, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual\ninformation of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is\nthat this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation\nconsistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is\nunsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a\nlearnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved\nwith code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive\nframework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct\nvisual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with\nreinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a\ndata-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical\nhallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each\nstrategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode. Experiments\ndemonstrate strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding\nbenchmarks.

To address these challenges, we introduce a fully\nautomatic two-stage framework for ICP grading, integrating keyframe\nidentification, ONSD measurement and clinical data. Specifically, the fundus\nultrasound video processing stage performs frame-level anatomical segmentation,\nrule-based keyframe identification guided by an international consensus\nstatement, and precise ONSD measurement. The intracranial pressure grading\nstage then fuses ONSD metrics with clinical features to enable the prediction\nof ICP grades, thereby demonstrating an innovative blend of interpretable\nultrasound analysis and multi-source data integration for objective clinical\nevaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a\nvalidation accuracy of $0.845 \\pm 0.071$ (with standard deviation from\nfive-fold cross-validation) and an independent test accuracy of 0.786,\nsignificantly outperforming conventional threshold-based method ($0.637 \\pm\n0.111$ validation accuracy, $0.429$ test accuracy). Through effectively\nreducing operator variability and integrating multi-source information, our\nframework establishes a reliable non-invasive approach for clinical ICP\nevaluation, holding promise for improving patient management in acute\nneurological conditions."}

The RIME algorithm is a recently proposed physical-based\nmetaheuristic algorithm with certain advantages. However, it suffers from rapid\nloss of population diversity during optimization and is prone to fall into\nlocal optima, leading to unbalanced exploitation and exploration. To address\nthe shortcomings of RIME, this paper proposes a modified RIME with covariance\nlearning and diversity enhancement (MRIME-CD). The algorithm applies three\nstrategies to improve the optimization capability. First, a covariance learning\nstrategy is introduced in the soft-rime search stage to increase the population\ndiversity and balance the over-exploitation ability of RIME through the\nbootstrapping effect of dominant populations. Second, in order to moderate the\ntendency of RIME population to approach the optimal individual in the early\nsearch stage, an average bootstrapping strategy is introduced into the\nhard-rime puncture mechanism, which guides the population search through the\nweighted position of the dominant populations, thus enhancing the global search\nability of RIME in the early stage. Finally, a new stagnation indicator is\nproposed, and a stochastic covariance learning strategy is used to update the\nstagnant individuals in the population when the algorithm gets stagnant, thus\nenhancing the ability to jump out of the local optimal solution. The proposed\nMRIME-CD algorithm is subjected to a series of validations on the CEC2017 test\nset, the CEC2022 test set, and the experimental results are analyzed using the\nFriedman test, the Wilcoxon rank sum test, and the Kruskal Wallis test. The\nresults show that MRIME-CD can effectively improve the performance of basic\nRIME and has obvious superiorities in terms of solution accuracy, convergence\nspeed and stability."}
