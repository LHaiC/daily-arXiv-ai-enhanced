X 2025) exhibited\na quantum algorithm for the noisy planted $k$XOR problem running quartically\nfaster than all known classical algorithms. In this work, we design a new\nclassical algorithm that is quadratically faster than the best previous one, in\nthe case of large constant $k$. Thus for such $k$, the quantum speedup of\nSchmidhuber et al. becomes only quadratic (though it retains a space\nadvantage). Our algorithm, which also works in the semirandom case, combines\ntools from sublinear-time algorithms (essentially, the birthday paradox) and\npolynomial anticoncentration."}

We\npropose SegDAC, a Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic method. SegDAC uses Segment\nAnything (SAM) for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World to ground\nsegments semantically via text prompts. It includes a novel transformer-based\narchitecture that supports a dynamic number of segments at each time step and\neffectively learns which segments to focus on using online RL, without using\nhuman labels. By evaluating SegDAC over a challenging visual generalization\nbenchmark using Maniskill3, which covers diverse manipulation tasks under\nstrong visual perturbations, we demonstrate that SegDAC achieves significantly\nbetter visual generalization, doubling prior performance on the hardest setting\nand matching or surpassing prior methods in sample efficiency across all\nevaluated tasks."}
