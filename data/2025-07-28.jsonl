The running time is $O(n^{2.84})$ on $n$-node\ngraphs, thus separating the task of detecting induced $4$-cycles from detecting\ntriangles, which requires $n^{3-o(1)}$ time combinatorially under the popular\nBMM hypothesis.\n  Significant work has gone into characterizing the exact time complexity of\ninduced $H$-detection, relative to the complexity of detecting cliques of\nvarious sizes. Prior work identified the question of whether induced $4$-cycle\ndetection is triangle-hard as the only remaining case towards completing the\nlowest level of the classification, dubbing it a \"curious\" case [Dalirrooyfard,\nVassilevska W., FOCS 2022]. Our result can be seen as a negative resolution of\nthis question.\n  Our algorithm deviates from previous techniques in the large body of subgraph\ndetection algorithms and employs the trendy topic of graph decomposition that\nhas hitherto been restricted to more global problems (as in the use of expander\ndecompositions for flow problems) or to shaving subpolynomial factors (as in\nthe application of graph regularity lemmas).

In the budget minimization version, the goal\nis to minimize the total cost of the removed edges, while achieving a desired\nincrease $\\Delta$ in the weight of the minimum spanning tree. An alternative\nobjective within the same framework is to maximize the profit of interdiction,\nnamely the increase in the weight of the minimum spanning tree, subject to a\nbudget constraint. There are known polynomial time $O(1)$ approximation\nguarantees for a similar objective (maximizing the total cost of the tree,\nrather than the increase). However, the guarantee does not seem to apply to the\nincrease in cost.

This\npaper introduces Perpetua, a method for modeling the dynamics of semi-static\nfeatures. Perpetua is able to: incorporate prior knowledge about the dynamics\nof the feature if it exists, track multiple hypotheses, and adapt over time to\nenable predicting of future feature states. Specifically, we chain together\nmixtures of \"persistence\" and \"emergence\" filters to model the probability that\nfeatures will disappear or reappear in a formal Bayesian framework. The\napproach is an efficient, scalable, general, and robust method for estimating\nthe states of features in an environment, both in the present as well as at\narbitrary future times.

Standard Kripke models are now considered\n$0$-ary models, whereas an $n$-ary model for $n > 0$ is a model whose set of\nobjects (''possible worlds'') contains only $(n-1)$-ary Kripke models. Models\nwith infinitely many layers are also considered. This framework is obtained by\npromoting a radical change of perspective in how modal semantics for\nnon-classical logics are defined: just like classical modalities are obtained\nthrough use of an accessibility relation between classical propositional\nmodels, non-classical modalities are now obtained through use of an\naccessibility relation between non-classical propositional models (even when\nthey are Kripke models already). The paper introduces the new models after\ndealing specifically with the case of intuitionistic modal logic. It is shown\nthat, depending on which intuitionistic $0$-ary propositional models are\nallowed, we may obtain $1$-ary models equivalent to either birelational models\nfor $IK$ or for a new logic called $MK$. Those $1$-ary models have an intuitive\nreading that adds to the interpretation of intuitionistic models in terms of\n''timelines'' the concept of ''alternative timelines''. More generally, the\n$1$-ary models can be read as defining a concept of ''alternative'' for any\nsubstantive interpretation of the $0$-ary models. The semantic clauses for\nnecessity and possibility of $MK$ are also modular and can be used to obtain\nsimilar modal semantics for every non-classical logic, each of which can be\nprovided with a similar intuitive reading. After intuitionistic modal logic is\ndealt with, the general structure of High-order Kripke Models and some of its\nvariants are defined, and a series of conjectures about their properties are\nstated."}

To overcome these drawbacks, we design an efficient\nsecond-order cone programming (SOCP)-based method using the weighted minimum\nmean squared error (WMMSE) framework to reduce computational complexity.\nFurthermore, to further reduce the computational complexity, we also propose a\nlow-complexity and solver-free algorithm that analytically updates all\nvariables by combining the smooth approximation theory and the\nmajorization-minimization (MM) method. Numerical results are provided to verify\nthe convergence and effectiveness of our proposed three algorithms. It is also\ndemonstrated that the SOCP-based method outperforms the penalty-based algorithm\nin terms of both the achieved min rate and the computational complexity. In\ncontrast, the lowcomplexity design achieves significantly lower complexity with\nonly slightly degraded performance."}

Market makers (MMs) play a fundamental role in providing\nliquidity, yet face significant challenges arising from inventory risk,\ncompetition, and non-stationary market dynamics. This research explores how RL,\nparticularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), can be employed to develop\nautonomous, adaptive, and profitable market making strategies.\n  The study begins by formulating the MM task as a reinforcement learning\nproblem, designing agents capable of operating in both single-agent and\nmulti-agent settings within a simulated financial environment. It then\naddresses the complex issue of inventory management using two complementary\napproaches: reward engineering and Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning\n(MORL). While the former uses dynamic reward shaping to guide behavior, the\nlatter leverages Pareto front optimization to explicitly balance competing\nobjectives.\n  To address the problem of non-stationarity, the research introduces POW-dTS,\na novel policy weighting algorithm based on Discounted Thompson Sampling. This\nmethod allows agents to dynamically select and combine pretrained policies,\nenabling continual adaptation to shifting market conditions.\n  The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RL-based approaches\nsignificantly outperform traditional and baseline algorithmic strategies across\nvarious performance metrics. Overall, this research thesis contributes new\nmethodologies and insights for the design of robust, efficient, and adaptive\nmarket making agents, reinforcing the potential of RL to transform algorithmic\ntrading in complex financial systems."}

To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose a data augmentation scheme based on scale-consistency properties of\nPDEs and design a scale-informed neural operator that can model a wide range of\nscales. Our formulation leverages the facts: (i) PDEs can be rescaled, or more\nconcretely, a given domain can be re-scaled to unit size, and the parameters\nand the boundary conditions of the PDE can be appropriately adjusted to\nrepresent the original solution, and (ii) the solution operators on a given\ndomain are consistent on the sub-domains.

In this\npaper, we introduce GENIAL, a machine learning-based framework for the\nautomatic generation and optimization of arithmetic units, more specifically\nmultipliers.\n  At the core of GENIAL is a Transformer-based surrogate model trained in two\nstages, involving self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised\nfinetuning, to robustly forecast key hardware metrics such as power and area\nfrom abstracted design representations. By inverting the surrogate model,\nGENIAL efficiently searches for new operand encodings that directly minimize\npower consumption in arithmetic units for specific input data distributions.\nExtensive experiments on large datasets demonstrate that GENIAL is consistently\nmore sample efficient than other methods, and converges faster towards\noptimized designs. This enables to deploy a high-effort logic synthesis\noptimization flow in the loop, improving the accuracy of the surrogate model.\nNotably, GENIAL automatically discovers encodings that achieve up to 18%\nswitching activity savings within multipliers on representative AI workloads\ncompared with the conventional two's complement. We also demonstrate the\nversatility of our approach by achieving significant improvements on Finite\nState Machines, highlighting GENIAL's applicability for a wide spectrum of\nlogic functions.

Extensive validation against experiments\nreveals a striking dichotomy.

Static, local properties, density, and lattice parameters\nare captured excellently by DP-M, especially in Fe-rich alloys, whereas DP-NM\nfails.

We begin by supposing that data representations can be\nsemantically separated into task-relevant content features, which contain\ninformation relevant to downstream tasks, and task-irrelevant style features,\nwhich encompass superficial attributes that are irrelevant to these tasks, yet\nmay degrade performance due to associations with content present in training\ndata that do not generalize. We then prove that our anti-contrastive penalty,\nwhich we call Pair-Switching (PS), minimizes the Mutual Information between the\nstyle attributes and content labels. Finally, we instantiate CLEAR in the\nlatent space of a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), then perform experiments to\nquantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the resulting CLEAR-VAE over several\nimage datasets. Our results show that CLEAR-VAE allows us to: (a) swap and\ninterpolate content and style between any pair of samples, and (b) improve\ndownstream classification performance in the presence of previously unseen\ncombinations of content and style. Our code will be made publicly available."}

However,\nthe vast majority of existing next-location prediction models do not reason\nover maps \\textbf{in the way that humans do}. Fortunately, the recent\ndevelopment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has demonstrated strong\ncapabilities in visual perception and even visual reasoning. This opens up a\nnew possibility: by rendering both the road network and trajectory onto an\nimage and leveraging the reasoning abilities of VLMs, we can enable models to\nperform trajectory inference in a human-like manner. To explore this idea, we\nfirst propose a method called Vision-Guided Location Search (VGLS), which\nevaluates whether a general-purpose VLM is capable of trajectory-based\nreasoning without modifying any of its internal parameters. Based on insights\nfrom the VGLS results, we further propose our main approach: VLMLocPredictor,\nwhich is composed of two stages: In the first stage, we design two Supervised\nFine-Tuning (SFT) tasks that help the VLM understand road network and\ntrajectory structures and acquire basic reasoning ability on such visual\ninputs.

Core technical components-retrieval mechanisms,\nsequence-to-sequence generation models, and fusion strategies are examined in\ndetail. A year-by-year analysis highlights key milestones and research trends,\nproviding insight into RAG's rapid growth. The paper further explores the\ndeployment of RAG in enterprise systems, addressing practical challenges\nrelated to retrieval of proprietary data, security, and scalability. A\ncomparative evaluation of RAG implementations is conducted, benchmarking\nperformance on retrieval accuracy, generation fluency, latency, and\ncomputational efficiency. Persistent challenges such as retrieval quality,\nprivacy concerns, and integration overhead are critically assessed. Finally,\nthe review highlights emerging solutions, including hybrid retrieval\napproaches, privacy-preserving techniques, optimized fusion strategies, and\nagentic RAG architectures. These innovations point toward a future of more\nreliable, efficient, and context-aware knowledge-intensive NLP systems."}

The Belief Stochastic Game model addresses this\nchallenge by delegating state estimation to the game model itself. This allows\nagents to operate on externally provided belief states, thereby reducing the\nneed for game-specific inference logic. This paper investigates two approaches\nto represent beliefs in games with hidden piece identities: a constraint-based\nmodel using Constraint Satisfaction Problems and a probabilistic extension\nusing Belief Propagation to estimate marginal probabilities. We evaluated the\nimpact of both representations using general-purpose agents across two\ndifferent games. Our findings indicate that constraint-based beliefs yield\nresults comparable to those of probabilistic inference, with minimal\ndifferences in agent performance. This suggests that constraint-based belief\nstates alone may suffice for effective decision-making in many settings."}

While traditional\nmodels like CNNs and RNNs have achieved moderate success, they often struggle\nto generalize across diverse and complex actions. Recent advancements in\nvision-language models, especially the transformer-based CLIP model, offer\npromising capabilities for generalizing action recognition from video data. In\nthis work, we evaluate CLIP on the UCF-101 dataset and systematically analyze\nits performance under three masking strategies: (1) percentage-based and\nshape-based black masking at 10%, 30%, and 50%, (2) feature-specific masking to\nsuppress bias-inducing elements, and (3) isolation masking that retains only\nclass-specific regions. Our results reveal that CLIP exhibits inconsistent\nbehavior and frequent misclassifications, particularly when essential visual\ncues are obscured. To overcome these limitations, we propose incorporating\nclass-specific noise, learned via a custom loss function, to reinforce\nattention to class-defining features.

For the 3D geometric prior modeling, we\nfirst model geometrically aware view invariance using multi-view constraints,\ni.e., leveraging imaging geometric principles to provide matching constraints\nbetween multiple images that see the same points.

Innovator introduces a four-stage upcycle training paradigm: (1)\nScientific Expert Induction on discipline-specific data, (2) Fine-grained\nExpert Splitting via FFN dimension decomposition, (3) Science-Aware Routing\nwarmup, and (4) Generalist-Scientist Integration training on hybrid datasets.\nSuch a paradigm enables knowledge in the general domain, and different\nscientific disciplines can be decoupled, avoiding the negative influence among\nknowledge in different domains. With 53.3B total parameters and 13.3B\nactivated, Innovator extends Qwen2.5-7B using a shared general expert and 64\nspecialized scientific experts with 8 activated. Trained on 300B tokens with\ntri-level quality-controlled data, Innovator achieves 25% average improvement\nacross 30 scientific tasks with a win rate as 70%, while retaining 99%\nperformance in general tasks. Furthermore, Innovator-Reason, which is\npost-trained from Innovator for reasoning boosting, exhibits excellent\nreasoning performance in solving complex scientific problems with improvements\nover 30%."}

To address this, we propose Human Gaussian\nGraph to model the connection between predicted Gaussians and human SMPL mesh,\nso that we can leverage information from all frames to recover an animatable\nhuman representation.

This process results in a reservoir that is\ndirectly informed by the specific dynamics of the prediction task under study.\nWe assess the DyRC-VG method through prediction tasks involving the canonical\nnonlinear Duffing oscillator, evaluating prediction accuracy and consistency.\nCompared to an Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi graph of the same size, spectral radius, and\ncomparable density, we observe higher prediction quality and more consistent\nperformance over repeated implementations in the DyRC-VG."}

This leads to steady-state\nentanglement, phase locking, and exceptional points (EPs) in the Liouvillian\nspectrum, signaling a collapse of the mode basis and the emergence of\nnon-dissipative stabilized dynamics. Using a Lindblad framework, we show that\nsymmetry in the noise correlations acts as a control parameter, protecting\nsymmetric or antisymmetric modes depending on the sign of the correlation. In\nthe pure-dephasing limit, coherence decay mirrors the Anderson-Kubo model,\nwhere the effective fluctuation strength scales as $\\sigma^2(1 \\pm \\xi)$, and\nthe dynamical regime (Gaussian vs. Lorentzian) is set by the ratio \\( \\sigma /\n\\gamma \\).

While there exist the no-hiding and\nno-masking theorems, approximate quantum information masking (AQIM) offers a\npromising means of circumventing the constraints. Despite its potential, AQIM\nstill remains underexplored, and constructing explicit approximate maskers\nremains a challenge. In this work, we investigate AQIM from multiple\nperspectives and propose using random isometries to construct approximate\nmaskers. First, different notions of AQIM are introduced and we find there are\nprofound intrinsic connections among them. These relationships are\ncharacterized by a set of figures of merit, which are introduced to quantify\nthe deviation of AQIM from exact QIM. We then explore the possibility of\nrealizing AQIM via random isometries in bipartite and multipartite systems. In\nbipartite systems, we identify a fundamental lower bound for a key figure of\nmerit, implying that almost all random isometries fail to realize AQIM. This\nsurprising result generalizes the original no-masking theorem to the\nno-random-AQIM theorem for bipartite systems. In contrast, in multipartite\nsystems, we show almost all random isometries can realize AQIM. Remarkably, the\nnumber of physical qubits required to randomly mask a single logical qubit\nscales only linearly. We further explore the implications of these findings. In\nparticular, we show that, under certain conditions, approximate quantum error\ncorrection is equivalent to AQIM. Consequently, AQIM naturally gives rise to\napproximate quantum error correction codes with constant code rates and\nexponentially small correction inaccuracies.

Most importantly, it defines an LP's functional importance through\nthe Liquidity Stability Impact Score (LSIS), a counterfactual metric that\nmeasures the potential degradation of the market if the LP withdraws. This\ncombined approach provides a more detailed and realistic characterization of an\nLP's impact, moving beyond the binary and often misleading classifications used\nby existing methods. This impact-focused and comprehensive approach enables\nSILS to accurately identify high-impact LPs-including those missed by\ntraditional methods and supports essential applications like a protective\noracle layer and actionable trader signals, thereby significantly enhancing\nDeFi ecosystem. The framework provides unprecedented transparency into the\nunderlying liquidity structure and associated risks, effectively reducing the\ncommon false positives and uncovering critical false negatives found in\ntraditional models. Therefore, SILS provides an effective mechanism for\nproactive risk management, transforming how DeFi protocols safeguard their\necosystems against asymmetric liquidity behavior."}

Methods: In this study, a self-training framework is\nproposed by leveraging a teacher-student model for the segmentation of\npulmonary vessels. First, the high-quality annotations are acquired in the\nin-house data by an interactive way. Then, the model is trained in the\nsemi-supervised way. A fully supervised model is trained on a small set of\nlabeled CT images, yielding the teacher model. Following this, the teacher\nmodel is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled CT images, from which\nreliable ones are selected based on a certain strategy. The training of the\nstudent model involves these reliable pseudo-labels. This training process is\niteratively repeated until an optimal performance is achieved. Results:\nExtensive experiments are performed on non-enhanced CT scans of 125 COPD\npatients. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod, Semi2, significantly improves the precision of vessel segmentation by\n2.3%, achieving a precision of 90.3%. Further, quantitative analysis is\nconducted in the pulmonary vessel of COPD, providing insights into the\ndifferences in the pulmonary vessel across different severity of the disease.\nConclusion: The proposed method can not only improve the performance of\npulmonary vascular segmentation, but can also be applied in COPD analysis.

Conventional saliency prediction models,\ntypically employing segmentation approaches, rely on low-resolution imagery to\ngenerate saliency heatmaps, subsequently upscaled to native resolutions, which\nlimiting their capacity to capture personalized attention patterns.\nFurthermore, MLLMs are constrained by factors such as hallucinations, making it\nvery costly to strictly adhere to the expected format in tasks involving\nmultiple point predictions, and achieving precise point positioning is\nchallenging.

A CNN takes a single image as input and outputs a coarse 3D\nmodel represented as an assembly of primitives, along with the target's pose\nrelative to the camera. This assembly of primitives is then used to initialize\n3DGS, significantly reducing the number of training iterations and input images\nneeded -- by at least an order of magnitude. For additional flexibility, the\nCNN component has multiple variants with different pose estimation techniques.\nThis work performs a comparison between these variants, evaluating their\neffectiveness for downstream 3DGS training under noisy or implicit pose\nestimates. The results demonstrate that even with imperfect pose supervision,\nthe pipeline is able to learn high-fidelity 3D representations, opening the\ndoor for the use of novel view synthesis in space applications."}

Project Page: https://bjkim95.github.io/haircup/", "summary": "We present a universal prior model for 3D head avatars with explicit hair\ncompositionality. Existing approaches to build generalizable priors for 3D head\navatars often adopt a holistic modeling approach, treating the face and hair as\nan inseparable entity. This overlooks the inherent compositionality of the\nhuman head, making it difficult for the model to naturally disentangle face and\nhair representations, especially when the dataset is limited. Furthermore, such\nholistic models struggle to support applications like 3D face and hairstyle\nswapping in a flexible and controllable manner. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce a prior model that explicitly accounts for the compositionality of\nface and hair, learning their latent spaces separately. A key enabler of this\napproach is our synthetic hairless data creation pipeline, which removes hair\nfrom studio-captured datasets using estimated hairless geometry and texture\nderived from a diffusion prior. By leveraging a paired dataset of hair and\nhairless captures, we train disentangled prior models for face and hair,\nincorporating compositionality as an inductive bias to facilitate effective\nseparation. Our model's inherent compositionality enables seamless transfer of\nface and hair components between avatars while preserving identity.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that our model can be fine-tuned in a few-shot\nmanner using monocular captures to create high-fidelity, hair-compositional 3D\nhead avatars for unseen subjects. These capabilities highlight the practical\napplicability of our approach in real-world scenarios, paving the way for\nflexible and expressive 3D avatar generation."}

Perpetua is able to: incorporate prior knowledge about the dynamics\nof the feature if it exists, track multiple hypotheses, and adapt over time to\nenable predicting of future feature states. Specifically, we chain together\nmixtures of \"persistence\" and \"emergence\" filters to model the probability that\nfeatures will disappear or reappear in a formal Bayesian framework.
