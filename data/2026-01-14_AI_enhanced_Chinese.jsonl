Given two instances $A$ and $B$ on the same set of agents, a matching is said to be robust if it is stable under both instances. This notion captures desirable robustness properties in matching markets where preferences may evolve, be misreported, or be subject to uncertainty. While the classical theory of stable matchings reveals rich lattice, algorithmic, and polyhedral structure for a single instance, it is unclear which of these properties persist when stability is required across multiple instances. Our work initiates a systematic study of the structural and computational behavior of robust stable matchings under increasingly general models of preference changes.\n  We analyze robustness under a hierarchy of perturbation models:\n  1. a single upward shift in one agent's preference list,\n  2. an arbitrary permutation change by a single agent, and\n  3. arbitrary preference changes by multiple agents on both sides.\n  For each regime, we characterize when:\n  1. the set of robust stable matchings forms a sublattice,\n  2. the lattice of robust stable matchings admits a succinct Birkhoff partial order enabling efficient enumeration,\n  3. worker-optimal and firm-optimal robust stable matchings can be computed efficiently, and\n  4. the robust stable matching polytope is integral (by studying its LP formulation).\n  We provide explicit counterexamples demonstrating where these structural and geometric properties break down, and complement these results with XP-time algorithms running in $O(n^k)$ time, parameterized by $k$, the number of agents whose preferences change.

Given a tournament digraph $D$, which encodes the outcomes of all possible matches, and a designated player $v^* \\in V(D)$, the \\textsc{Tournament Fixing} problem (TFP) asks whether the tournament can be scheduled in a way that guarantees $v^*$ emerges as the winner. TFP is known to be NP-hard, but is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) when parameterized by structural measures such as the feedback arc set (fas) or feedback vertex set (fvs) number of the tournament digraph. In this paper, we introduce and study two new structural parameters: the number of players who can defeat $v^*$ (i.e., the in-degree of $v^*$, denoted by $k$) and the number of players that $v^*$ can defeat (i.e., the out-degree of $v^*$, denoted by $\\ell$).\n  A natural question is that: can TFP be efficiently solved when $k$ or $\\ell$ is small? We answer this question affirmatively by showing that TFP is FPT when parameterized by either the in-degree or out-degree of $v^*$. Our algorithm for the in-degree parameterization is particularly involved and technically intricate.

We propose a fundamentally different paradigm inspired by natural coordination mechanisms: agents operate locally on a shared artifact, guided only by pressure gradients derived from measurable quality signals, with temporal decay preventing premature convergence. We formalize this as optimization over a pressure landscape and prove convergence guarantees under mild conditions.\n  Empirically, on Latin Square constraint satisfaction across 1,078 trials, pressure-field coordination matches hierarchical control (38.2% vs 38.8% aggregate solve rate, p=0.94, indicating statistical equivalence). Both significantly outperform sequential (23.3%), random (11.7%), and conversation-based multi-agent dialogue (8.6%, p<0.00001). Temporal decay is essential: disabling it increases final pressure 49-fold (d=4.15). On easy problems, pressure-field achieves 87% solve rate. The approach maintains consistent performance from 2 to 32 agents.

In contrast, modern learning-based robot control is increasingly trained and deployed from RGB observations on lower-cost hardware.\n  Our key insight is twofold. First, we cast robot state estimation as 6D pose estimation of each link from a single RGB image: the robot-camera base transform is obtained directly as the estimated base-link pose, and the joint state is recovered via a lightweight global optimization that enforces kinematic consistency with the observed link poses (optionally warm-started with encoder readings). Second, we make per-link 6D pose estimation robust and simple - even without learning - by introducing the fiducial exoskeleton: a lightweight 3D-printed mount with a fiducial marker on each link and known marker-link geometry.\n  This design yields robust camera-robot extrinsics, per-link SE(3) poses, and joint-angle state from a single image, enabling robust state estimation even on unplugged robots.

In their seminal work, Fomin, Lokshtanov, Misra & Saurabh [FOCS 2012] gave a polynomial kernel for this problem when the family F contains a planar graph. As the size of their kernel is g(F) * k^{f(F)}, a natural follow-up question was whether the dependence on F in the exponent of k can be avoided.

Correlation strength showed scale-dependence with respect to surface features and biological structure: individual bacteria and small colonies correlated more strongly with fine-scale topographic features, whereas macrophage morphology correlated more strongly with larger-scale surface features.

We address this fundamental problem by implementing and comparing three sophisticated syndrome measurement strategies: Shor's cat-state approach, which distributes measurements across multiple entangled ancillas achieving 85-92% preparation success; Steane's encoded-ancilla method using complete error-corrected logical qubits reaching 97.8% syndrome fidelity; and a flexible unified framework that adapts strategies based on hardware capabilities.

The first question is how to enable a model to recognize that it does not know. A promising approach is to use confidence, computed from the model's internal signals, to reflect its ignorance. Prior work in specific domains has shown that calibration can provide reliable confidence estimates. In this work, we propose a simple, effective, and universal training-free method that applies to both vision and language models, performing model calibration, cascading, and data cleaning to better exploit a model's ability to recognize when it does not know. We first highlight two key empirical observations: higher confidence corresponds to higher accuracy within a single model, and models calibrated on the validation set remain calibrated on a held-out test set. These findings empirically establish the reliability and comparability of calibrated confidence. Building on this, we introduce two applications: (1) model cascading with calibrated advantage routing and (2) data cleaning based on model ensemble. Using the routing signal derived from the comparability of calibrated confidences, we cascade large and small models to improve efficiency with almost no compromise in accuracy, and we further cascade two models of comparable scale to achieve performance beyond either model alone. Leveraging multiple experts and their calibrated confidences, we design a simple yet effective data-cleaning method that balances precision and detection rate to identify mislabeled samples in ImageNet and Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) datasets.

In this study, we demonstrate that the symmetry control in the previous conditional crystal generation model may not be sufficiently effective when space group constraints are applied as a condition.

Regularisation-based CL approaches, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Synaptic Intelligence (SI), and Memory Aware Synapses (MAS), are commonly used as baselines in EEG-based CL studies, yet their suitability for this problem remains underexplored. This study theoretically and empirically finds that regularisation-based CL methods show limited performance for EEG-based emotion classification on the DREAMER and SEED datasets. We identify a fundamental misalignment in the stability-plasticity trade-off, where regularisation-based methods prioritise mitigating catastrophic forgetting (backward transfer) over adapting to new subjects (forward transfer). We investigate this limitation under subject-incremental sequences and observe that: (1) the heuristics for estimating parameter importance become less reliable under noisy data and covariate shift, (2) gradients on parameters deemed important by these heuristics often interfere with gradient updates required for new subjects, moving optimisation away from the minimum, (3) importance values accumulated across tasks over-constrain the model, and (4) performance is sensitive to subject order. Forward transfer showed no statistically significant improvement over sequential fine-tuning (p > 0.05 across approaches and datasets).

Recently, one work has attempted to study how to maintain Leiden communities in the dynamic graph, but it lacks a detailed theoretical analysis, and its algorithms are inefficient for large graphs. To address these issues, in this paper, we first theoretically show that the existing algorithms are relatively unbounded via the boundedness analysis (a powerful tool for analyzing incremental algorithms on dynamic graphs), and also analyze the memberships of vertices in communities when the graph changes. Based on theoretical analysis, we develop a novel efficient maintenance algorithm, called Hierarchical Incremental Tree Leiden (HIT-Leiden), which effectively reduces the range of affected vertices by maintaining the connected components and hierarchical community structures.

To accelerate these kernels, we present a portable, mixed-precision solver designed for Matrix Processing Units (MXUs), including NVIDIA Tensor Cores (H200) and AMD Matrix Cores (MI300X). Our algorithm builds on a nested recursive formulation in which Cholesky exposes parallelism through recursive decomposition of its TRSM and SYRK sub-problems.

We introduce a custom recursive data structure that assigns low-precision FP16 arithmetic to large off-diagonal blocks, while preserving high precision on diagonal blocks to ensure numerical stability. The solver is implemented in Julia, leveraging array programming, multiple dispatch, and dynamic type inference to enable seamless expression of mixed-precision computation. This design provides a high-level, hardware-agnostic interface while efficiently interfacing with low-level vendor libraries for backend portability. On H200, our recursive FP64 SYRK achieves a 14x speedup over cuBLAS, while mixed-precision delivers up to 27x speedup in SYRK and 5x in TRSM over full-precision baselines.

In some magnetic van der Waals bilayers, when the electrostatic energy of polarization can compensate the interlayer magnetic coupling, a magnetoelectric torque is generated to fastly flip spins within a few picoseconds, which is demonstrated by combining the first-principles calculations, analytic model, as well as atomistic simulations. Such a magnetoelectric torque doesn't rely on the spin-orbit coupling and is generally active in polar magnetic homostructures and heterostructures.

They rely heavily on tangent-space operations, which often lead to mapping distortions during frequent transitions. Moreover, their message-passing architectures mainly focus on local neighborhood information, making it difficult to capture global hierarchical structures and long-range dependencies between different types of nodes. To address these limitations, we propose Hyperbolic Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HypHGT), which effectively and efficiently learns heterogeneous graph representations entirely within the hyperbolic space. Unlike previous message-passing based hyperbolic heterogeneous GNNs, HypHGT naturally captures both local and global dependencies through transformer-based architecture. Furthermore, the proposed relation-specific hyperbolic attention mechanism in HypHGT, which operates with linear time complexity, enables efficient computation while preserving the heterogeneous information across different relation types. This design allows HypHGT to effectively capture the complex structural properties and semantic information inherent in heterogeneous graphs. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of HypHGT, and the results demonstrate that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification task, with significantly reduced training time and memory usage.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this scenario, it is important to consider the target character's facial structure and possible range of motion to preserve the semantics assumed by the original facial motions after the retargeting. To achieve this, we propose a local patch-based retargeting method that transfers facial animations captured in a source performance video to a target stylized 3D character. Our method consists of three modules. The Automatic Patch Extraction Module extracts local patches from the source video frame. These patches are processed through the Reenactment Module to generate correspondingly re-enacted target local patches. The Weight Estimation Module calculates the animation parameters for the target character at every frame for the creation of a complete facial animation sequence.

It has been known for more than three decades that the unification type of an equational theory may vary, depending on which instantiation preorder is used. More precisely, it was shown in 1991 that the theory ACUI of an associative, commutative, and idempotent binary function symbol with a unit is unitary w.r.t. the restricted instantiation preorder, but not unitary w.r.t. the unrestricted one. In 2016 this result was strengthened by showing that the unrestricted type of this theory also cannot be finitary. In the conference version of this article, we considerably improved on this result by proving that ACUI is infinitary w.r.t. the unrestricted instantiation preorder, thus precluding type zero. We also showed that, w.r.t. this preorder, the unification type of ACU (where idempotency is removed from the axioms) and of AC (where additionally the unit is removed) is infinitary, though it is respectively unitary and finitary in the restricted case. In the other direction, we proved (using the example of unification in the description logic EL) that the unification type may actually improve from type zero to infinitary when switching from the restricted instantiation preorder to the unrestricted one. In the present article, we not only determine the unrestricted unification type of considerably more equational theories, but we also prove general results for whole classes of theories. In particular, we show that theories that are regular and finite, regular and locally finite, or regular, monoidal, and satisfy an additional condition are Noetherian, and thus cannot have unrestricted unification type zero.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This paper examines how frontier AI regulations in the United States and European Union in 2025 handle internal deployment. We identify three gaps that could cause internally-deployed systems to evade intended oversight: (1) scope ambiguity that allows internal systems to evade regulatory obligations, (2) point-in-time compliance assessments that fail to capture the continuous evolution of internal systems, and (3) information asymmetries that subvert regulatory awareness and oversight. We then analyze why these gaps persist, examining tensions around measurability, incentives, and information access.

The prevailing editing paradigm, which appends an update matrix to the original parameter matrix, has been shown by some studies to damage key numerical stability indicators (such as condition number and norm), thereby reducing editing performance and general abilities, especially in sequential editing scenario. Although subsequent methods have made some improvements, they remain within the additive framework and have not fundamentally addressed this limitation. To solve this problem, we analyze it from both statistical and mathematical perspectives and conclude that multiplying the original matrix by an orthogonal matrix does not change the numerical stability of the matrix. Inspired by this, different from the previous additive editing paradigm, a multiplicative editing paradigm termed Multiplicative Orthogonal Sequential Editing (MOSE) is proposed. Specifically, we first derive the matrix update in the multiplicative form, the new knowledge is then incorporated into an orthogonal matrix, which is multiplied by the original parameter matrix. In this way, the numerical stability of the edited matrix is unchanged, thereby maintaining editing performance and general abilities. We compared MOSE with several current knowledge editing methods, systematically evaluating their impact on both editing performance and the general abilities across three different LLMs. Experimental results show that MOSE effectively limits deviations in the edited parameter matrix and maintains its numerical stability.

Despite recent research efforts, existing QFL frameworks struggle to achieve optimal model training performance primarily due to inherent heterogeneity in terms of (i) quantum noise where current quantum devices are subject to varying levels of noise due to varying device quality and susceptibility to quantum decoherence, and (ii) heterogeneous data distributions where data across participating quantum devices are naturally non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID). To address these challenges, we propose a novel integrated sporadic-personalized approach called SPQFL that simultaneously handles quantum noise and data heterogeneity in a single QFL framework. It is featured in two key aspects: (i) for quantum noise heterogeneity, we introduce a notion of sporadic learning to tackle quantum noise heterogeneity across quantum devices, and (ii) for quantum data heterogeneity, we implement personalized learning through model regularization to mitigate overfitting during local training on non-IID quantum data distributions, thereby enhancing the convergence of the global model. Moreover, we conduct a rigorous convergence analysis for the proposed SPQFL framework, with both sporadic and personalized learning considerations. Theoretical findings reveal that the upper bound of the SPQFL algorithm is strongly influenced by both the number of quantum devices and the number of quantum noise measurements.

Intelligent load scheduling is therefore crucial to minimize operational costs while maintaining reliability. Reinforcement Learning has shown promise in improving energy efficiency and reducing costs.

In an Aharonov-Bohm double-slit experiment, the theory predicts that the position probability density depends on which slit the particle trajectory crosses, due to a non-integrable scale induced by the magnetic flux. This experimental prediction can be realistically tested for an electrically neutral, heavy molecule with mass $m \\sim 10^{-19} \\text{g}$ at a $\\sim 10^6 \\text{ esu}$ flux regime. We analyse the Weyl-Einstein debate on the second-clock effect using the theory and show that spectral frequencies are history-independent. We thereby resolve Einstein's key objection against local scale invariance, and obtain two further experimental predictions. First, spectral intensities turn out to be history-dependent. Second, energy eigenvalues are modified by tiny imaginary corrections that modify spectral linewidths. We argue that the trajectory dependence of the probabilities renders our theory empirically distinguishable from other quantum formulations that do not use pilot-wave trajectories, or their mathematical equivalents, to derive experimental predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, due to memory constraints, MoE models with billions or even trillions of parameters can only be deployed in multi-GPU or even multi-node & multi-GPU based serving systems. Thus, communication has became a major bottleneck in distributed serving systems, especially inter-node communication. Contemporary distributed MoE models are primarily implemented using all-reduce (AR) based tensor parallelism (TP) and all-to-all (A2A) based expert parallelism (EP). However, TP generally exhibits low inter-node efficiency and is thus confined to high-speed intra-node bandwidth. In contrast, EP tends to suffer from load imbalance, especially when the parallel degree is high.\n  In this work, we introduce MixServe, a novel automatic distributed serving system for efficient deployment of MoE models by a novel TP-EP hybrid parallelism based on fused AR-A2A communication algorithm. MixServe begins by evaluating the communication overhead associated with various parallel strategies, taking into account the model hyperparameters and the configurations of network and hardware resources, and then automatically selects the most efficient parallel strategy. Then, we propose the TP-EP hybrid parallelism based on fused AR-A2A communication algorithm that overlaps intra-node AR communication and inter-node A2A communication. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3 models demonstrate that MixServe achieves superior inference performance, with 1.08~3.80x acceleration in time to first token (TTFT), 1.03~1.66x acceleration in inter-token latency (ITL), and 5.2%~50.3% throughput improvement compared to existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

So far, the study of these and other 3D nanostructures is usually confined to a limited number of magnetic microscopy experiments in large facilities. Here, we investigate the reversal mechanism of a single DH nanowire using Dark-Field magneto-optical Kerr effect (DF-MOKE) magnetometry under external 3D magnetic fields. By analyzing the angular dependence of the DF-MOKE signal, we fit the reversal process using established models for domain-wall nucleation and propagation, finding a characteristic behavior similar to that reported for cylindrical nanowires. Micromagnetic simulations indicate that the reversal process goes through nucleation of the helical vortex tube in a curling manner while ptychographic X-ray magnetic circular dichroism data reveal that this helical vortex tube state forms through a mixed nucleation-propagation process. These observations provide a consistent microscopic picture of reversal mediated by a helical vortex tube extending along the nanowire. Our work provides a comprehensive characterization of magnetization reversal in DH nanowires and demonstrates that DF-MOKE magnetometry is effective for probing reversal mechanisms in single 3D nanostructures.

As a result, these models are unable to adaptively select optimal viewpoints or resolutions during task execution, which significantly limits their performance in long-horizon tasks and fine-grained manipulation scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose ActiveVLA, a novel vision-language-action framework that empowers robots with active perception capabilities for high-precision, fine-grained manipulation. ActiveVLA adopts a coarse-to-fine paradigm, dividing the process into two stages: (1) Critical region localization. ActiveVLA projects 3D inputs onto multi-view 2D projections, identifies critical 3D regions, and supports dynamic spatial awareness. (2) Active perception optimization. Drawing on the localized critical regions, ActiveVLA uses an active view selection strategy to choose optimal viewpoints. These viewpoints aim to maximize amodal relevance and diversity while minimizing occlusions. Additionally, ActiveVLA applies a 3D zoom-in to improve resolution in key areas. Together, these steps enable finer-grained active perception for precise manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ActiveVLA achieves precise 3D manipulation and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on three simulation benchmarks.

Despite their apparent simplicity, these constraints fail with striking regularity, and the conditions governing failure have remained poorly understood. This paper presents the first comprehensive mechanistic investigation of negative instruction failure. We introduce semantic pressure, a quantitative measure of the model's intrinsic probability of generating the forbidden token, and demonstrate that violation probability follows a tight logistic relationship with pressure ($p=\u03c3(-2.40+2.27\\cdot P_0)$; $n=40{,}000$ samples; bootstrap $95%$ CI for slope: $[2.21,,2.33]$). Through layer-wise analysis using the logit lens technique, we establish that the suppression signal induced by negative instructions is present but systematically weaker in failures: the instruction reduces target probability by only 5.2 percentage points in failures versus 22.8 points in successes -- a $4.4\\times$ asymmetry. We trace this asymmetry to two mechanistically distinct failure modes. In priming failure (87.5% of violations), the instruction's explicit mention of the forbidden word paradoxically activates rather than suppresses the target representation. In override failure (12.5%), late-layer feed-forward networks generate contributions of $+0.39$ toward the target probability -- nearly $4\\times$ larger than in successes -- overwhelming earlier suppression signals. Activation patching confirms that layers 23--27 are causally responsible: replacing these layers' activations flips the sign of constraint effects.

We address this challenge by introducing a sliced Wasserstein loss function for distribution-aware calibration in ultra-low-bit post-training quantization. The proposed loss aligns the output distributions of full-precision and quantized models under random linear projections, complementing standard mean-squared error loss without adding any computational overhead during inference. Our proposed loss function can be incorporated with any post-training quantization framework that has a retraining component. We demonstrate the performance gains of our proposed model by incorporating it with two frontier methods known as OmniQuant and TesseraQ. Compared to these two baselines, the proposed loss consistently improves both perplexity and downstream task accuracy across multiple ultra-low-bit settings. Our proposed loss function recovers 4.12-20.37% of the OmniQuant's lost accuracy on the language model LLaMA-2-7B, 0.93-7.65% on OPT-6.7B, and 2.26-6.20% on LLaMA-2-13B.

A plausible explanation for this change may be that, since the late 1990s and early 2000s, Bohmian mechanics has been taking on a more operational and practical role. The original hidden-variable idea has gradually faded from its framework, giving way to a more pragmatic approach that treats it as a suitable analytical and computational tool.

In an intermediate current regime, the STT drives large magnetisation vector fluctuations that cover the entire Bloch sphere. The continuous variable associated with the stochastic magnetisation direction may serve as a resource for probabilistic computing and neuromorphic hardware.

Previous works either focus on optimal performance, simplifying the controllability issue, or make the system controllable under structural assumptions, such as in graphs or when the input matrix is a design parameter. We generalize these approaches to offer a precise characterization of the general minimal actuator selection problem where a set of actuators is given, described by a fixed input matrix, and goal is to choose the fewest actuators that make the system controllable. We show that this problem can be equivalently cast as an integer linear program and, if actuation channels are sufficiently independent, as a set multicover problem under multiplicity constraints. The latter equivalence is always true if the state matrix has all distinct eigenvalues, in which case it simplifies to the set cover problem. Such characterizations hold even when a robust selection that tolerates a given number of faulty actuators is desired. Our established connection legitimates a designer to use algorithms from the rich literature on the set multicover problem to select the smallest subset of actuators, including exact solutions that do not require brute-force search.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We define these maneuvers as post crash lane changes. In such scenarios, vehicles in the target lane may refuse to yield even after the lane change has already begun, increasing the complexity and crash risk of post crash LCs. However, the behavioral characteristics and motion patterns of post crash LCs remain unknown. To address this gap, we construct a post crash LC dataset by extracting vehicle trajectories from drone videos captured after crashes. Our empirical analysis reveals that, compared to mandatory LCs (MLCs) and discretionary LCs (DLCs), post crash LCs exhibit longer durations, lower insertion speeds, and higher crash risks. Notably, 79.4% of post crash LCs involve at least one instance of non yielding behavior from the new follower, compared to 21.7% for DLCs and 28.6% for MLCs. Building on these findings, we develop a novel trajectory prediction framework for post crash LCs. At its core is a graph based attention module that explicitly models yielding behavior as an auxiliary interaction aware task. This module is designed to guide both a conditional variational autoencoder and a Transformer based decoder to predict the lane changer's trajectory. By incorporating the interaction aware module, our model outperforms existing baselines in trajectory prediction performance by more than 10% in both average displacement error and final displacement error across different prediction horizons. Moreover, our model provides more reliable crash risk analysis by reducing false crash rates and improving conflict prediction accuracy.

While ternary quantization offers a compelling solution by reducing weights to {-1, 0, +1}, current implementations suffer from a fundamental misalignment with commodity hardware. Most existing methods must choose between 2-bit aligned packing, which incurs significant bit wastage, or 1.67-bit irregular packing, which degrades inference speed. To resolve this tension, we propose Sherry, a hardware-efficient ternary quantization framework. Sherry introduces a 3:4 fine-grained sparsity that achieves a regularized 1.25-bit width by packing blocks of four weights into five bits, restoring power-of-two alignment. Furthermore, we identify weight trapping issue in sparse ternary training, which leads to representational collapse. To address this, Sherry introduces Arenas, an annealing residual synapse mechanism that maintains representational diversity during training. Empirical evaluations on LLaMA-3.2 across five benchmarks demonstrate that Sherry matches state-of-the-art ternary performance while significantly reducing model size. Notably, on an Intel i7-14700HX CPU, our 1B model achieves zero accuracy loss compared to SOTA baselines while providing 25% bit savings and 10% speed up.

However, there is a significant difference between pretraining corpora and time series data, making it hard to guarantee forecasting quality when directly applying LLMs to TSF; fine-tuning LLMs can mitigate this issue, but often incurs substantial computational overhead. Thus, LLM4TSF faces a dual challenge of prediction performance and compute overhead. To address this, we aim to explore a method for improving the forecasting performance of LLM4TSF while freezing all LLM parameters to reduce computational overhead. Inspired by in-context learning (ICL), we propose LVICL. LVICL uses our vector-injected ICL to inject example information into a frozen LLM, eliciting its in-context learning ability and thereby enhancing its performance on the example-related task (i.e., TSF). Specifically, we first use the LLM together with a learnable context vector adapter to extract a context vector from multiple examples adaptively. This vector contains compressed, example-related information. Subsequently, during the forward pass, we inject this vector into every layer of the LLM to improve forecasting performance.

To address these issues, we propose STO-RL (Offline RL using LLM-Guided Subgoal Temporal Order), an offline RL framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate temporally ordered subgoal sequences and corresponding state-to-subgoal-stage mappings.

We argue that graphs inherently contain rich structural and semantic information, and that their effective exploitation can unlock potential gains in LLMs reasoning performance. To this end, we propose Homophily-aware Structural and Semantic Compression for LLMs (HS2C), a framework centered on exploiting graph homophily. Structurally, guided by the principle of Structural Entropy minimization, we perform a global hierarchical partition that decodes the graph's essential topology. This partition identifies naturally cohesive, homophilic communities, while discarding stochastic connectivity noise. Semantically, we deliver the detected structural homophily to the LLM, empowering it to perform differentiated semantic aggregation based on predefined community type. This process compresses redundant background contexts into concise community-level consensus, selectively preserving semantically homophilic information aligned with the target nodes. Extensive experiments on 10 node-level benchmarks across LLMs of varying sizes and families demonstrate that, by feeding LLMs with structurally and semantically compressed inputs, HS2C simultaneously enhances the compression rate and downstream inference accuracy, validating its superiority and scalability.

The encoder compresses the flow field into a latent representation, while the diffusion model learns a generative prior over reconstructions conditioned on the compressed state. This design allows DiffCoder to recover distributional and spectral properties that are not strictly required for minimizing pointwise reconstruction loss but are critical for faithfully representing statistical properties of the flow field. We evaluate DiffCoder and VAE baselines across multiple model sizes and compression ratios on a challenging dataset of Kolmogorov flow fields. Under aggressive compression, DiffCoder significantly improves the spectral accuracy while VAEs exhibit substantial degradation. Although both methods show comparable relative L2 reconstruction error, DiffCoder better preserves the underlying distributional structure of the flow.

A fundamental difficulty in online RL is the lack of direct samples from the target distribution; instead, the target is an unnormalized Boltzmann distribution defined by the Q-function. To address this, two seemingly distinct families of methods have been proposed for diffusion policies: a noise-expectation family, which utilizes a weighted average of noise as the training target, and a gradient-expectation family, which employs a weighted average of Q-function gradients. Yet, it remains unclear how these objectives relate formally or if they can be synthesized into a more general formulation. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, reverse flow matching (RFM), which rigorously addresses the problem of training diffusion and flow models without direct target samples. By adopting a reverse inferential perspective, we formulate the training target as a posterior mean estimation problem given an intermediate noisy sample. Crucially, we introduce Langevin Stein operators to construct zero-mean control variates, deriving a general class of estimators that effectively reduce importance sampling variance. We show that existing noise-expectation and gradient-expectation methods are two specific instances within this broader class. This unified view yields two key advancements: it extends the capability of targeting Boltzmann distributions from diffusion to flow policies, and enables the principled combination of Q-value and Q-gradient information to derive an optimal, minimum-variance estimator, thereby improving training efficiency and stability.

Temperature data represents a complex superposition of deterministic cyclical climate forces and stochastic, short-term fluctuations. While planetary mechanics drive predictable seasonal periodicities, rapid meteorological changes such as thermal variations, pressure anomalies, and humidity shifts introduce nonlinear volatilities that defy simple extrapolation. Historically, the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model has been the standard for modeling historical weather data, prized for capturing linear seasonal trends. However, SARIMA operates under strict assumptions of stationarity, failing to capture abrupt, nonlinear transitions. This leads to systematic residual errors, manifesting as the under-prediction of sudden spikes or the over-smoothing of declines. Conversely, Deep Learning paradigms, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, demonstrate exceptional efficacy in handling intricate time-series data. By utilizing memory gates, LSTMs learn complex nonlinear dependencies. Yet, LSTMs face instability in open-loop forecasting; without ground truth feedback, minor deviations compound recursively, causing divergence. To resolve these limitations, we propose a Hybrid SARIMA-LSTM architecture. This framework employs a residual-learning strategy to decompose temperature into a predictable climate component and a nonlinear weather component. The SARIMA unit models the robust, long-term seasonal trend, while the LSTM is trained exclusively on the residuals the nonlinear errors SARIMA fails to capture. By fusing statistical stability with neural plasticity, this hybrid approach minimizes error propagation and enhances long-horizon accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In parallel, the emerging paradigm of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) provides empirical evidence that language-mediated supervision can serve as a viable alternative to traditional reward engineering.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a reference-frame-independent (RFI) QSDC protocol. This protocol only requires ensuring the calibration accuracy of one direction of the reference frame, while allowing a misalignment angle $\u03b2$ in the other two directions. To improve the protocol's robustness against reference frame fluctuations, we introduce a $\u03b2$-independent parameter C into the security analysis framework and rederive the protocol's security bounds. Additionally, we construct a system model and optimize the pulse intensity of the signal states, enabling the protocol to achieve optimal performance under each level of channel attenuation.

As a result, there is growing interest in (i) analyzing interpretability and generalization and (ii) developing models that perform robustly under data distributions different from those seen during training (i.e. domain generalization). However, the theoretical analysis of DL remains incomplete. For example, many generalization analyses assume independent samples, which is violated in sequential data with temporal correlations. Motivated by these limitations, this paper proposes a method to analyze interpretability and out-of-domain (OOD) generalization for a family of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Specifically, the evolution of a trained RNN's states is modeled as an unknown, discrete-time, nonlinear closed-loop feedback system. Using Koopman operator theory, these nonlinear dynamics are approximated with a linear operator, enabling interpretability. Spectral analysis is then used to quantify the worst-case impact of domain shifts on the generalization error.

We provide a detailed assessment of the accuracy of the framework by investigating its numerical stability and by comparing measured and predicted secular frequencies. The framework is optimized for numerical performance, enabling rapid numerical prototyping of trap architectures of increasing complexity. As application examples, we apply the framework to the transport of a potential well along a linear, uniformly segmented trap, and we compute a solution for shuttling a potential well around the corner of an X-type trap junction. The presented approach provides an extensible and highly efficient numerical foundation for designing and validating transport protocols in current and next-generation trapped-ion processors.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In parallel, recent advances in large-scale generative systems, particularly multimodal architectures, have demonstrated increasingly sophisticated forms of pattern recombination, raising questions about the nature and limits of machine creativity. This paper proposes a generative perspective on creativity in AI, framing it as an emergent property of domain-limited generative models embedded within bounded informational environments.

These projectors can then be coherently applied as state filters prior to quantum phase estimation (QPE). We analyze their asymptotic gate complexities for explicit circuit realizations. For the particle number and $S_z$ symmetries, GQSP offers favorable resource usage features owing to its low ancilla qubit requirements and robustness to finite precision rotation gate synthesis.

Numerical simulations show that symmetry filtering substantially increases the QPE success probability, leading to a lower overall cost compared to that of unfiltered approaches across representative molecular systems.

In this study, we propose a QA-in-the-loop kernel learning framework that integrates QA not merely as a substitute for Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling but as a component that directly determines the learned kernel for regression. Based on Bochner's theorem, a shift-invariant kernel is represented as an expectation over a spectral distribution, and random Fourier features (RFF) approximate the kernel by sampling frequencies. We model the spectral distribution with a (multi-layer) restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), generate discrete RBM samples using QA, and map them to continuous frequencies via a Gaussian--Bernoulli transformation. Using the resulting RFF, we construct a data-adaptive kernel and perform Nadaraya--Watson (NW) regression. Because the RFF approximation based on $\\cos(\\bm\u03c9^{\\top}\u0394\\bm{x})$ can yield small negative values and cancellation across neighbors, the Nadaraya--Watson denominator $\\sum_j k_{ij}$ may become close to zero. We therefore employ nonnegative squared-kernel weights $w_{ij}=k(\\bm{x}_i,\\bm{x}_j)^2$, which also enhances the contrast of kernel weights. The kernel parameters are trained by minimizing the leave-one-out NW mean squared error, and we additionally evaluate local linear regression with the same squared-kernel weights at inference.

We introduce the Noisy-device-enhanced Classical Simulation (NDE-CS) protocol, which improves stabilizer-based classical Monte Carlo simulation methods by incorporating data obtained from noisy quantum hardware. Specifically, NDE-CS uses noisy executions of a target circuit together with noisy Clifford circuits to learn how the target circuit can be expressed in terms of Clifford circuits under realistic noise. The same learned relation can then be reused in the noiseless Clifford limit, enabling accurate estimation of ideal expectation values with substantially reduced sampling cost. Numerical simulations on Trotterized Ising circuits demonstrate that NDE-CS achieves orders-of-magnitude reductions in sampling cost compared to the underlying purely classical Monte Carlo approaches from which it is derived, while maintaining the same accuracy. We also compare NDE-CS with Sparse Pauli Dynamics (SPD), a powerful classical framework capable of simulating quantum circuits at previously inaccessible scales, and provide an example where the cost of SPD scales exponentially with system size, while NDE-CS scales much more favorably.

To explain the intrinsic emergence, we analyze the queries, keys, and Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which jointly determine attention scores. Our empirical analysis reveals two characteristic conditions of SDHs: (1) Queries and keys are almost rank-one, and (2) RoPE is dominated by medium- and high-frequency components. Under these conditions, queries and keys are nearly identical across tokens, and interactions between medium- and high-frequency components of RoPE give rise to SDHs. Beyond empirical evidence, we theoretically show that these conditions are sufficient to ensure the emergence of SDHs by formalizing them as our modeling assumptions. Particularly, we analyze the training dynamics of a shallow Transformer equipped with RoPE under these conditions, and prove that models trained via gradient descent exhibit SDHs. The SDHs generalize to out-of-distribution prompts.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

It is well known that, in this classical setting, increasing the girth of the Tanner graph while maintaining regular degree distributions leads simultaneously to good belief-propagation (BP) decoding performance and large minimum distance. In the quantum setting, however, this principle does not directly apply because quantum LDPC codes must satisfy additional orthogonality constraints between their parity-check matrices. When one enforces both orthogonality and regularity in a straightforward manner, the girth is typically reduced and the minimum distance becomes structurally upper bounded.\n  In this work, we overcome this limitation by using permutation matrices with controlled commutativity and by restricting the orthogonality constraints to only the necessary parts of the construction, while preserving regular check-matrix structures. This design breaks the conventional trade-off between orthogonality, regularity, girth, and minimum distance, allowing us to construct quantum LDPC codes with large girth and without the usual distance upper bounds. As a concrete demonstration, we construct a girth-8, (3,12)-regular $[[9216,4612, \\leq 48]]$ quantum LDPC code and show that, under BP decoding combined with a low-complexity post-processing algorithm, it achieves a frame error rate as low as $10^{-8}$ on the depolarizing channel with error probability $4 \\%$.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this study, epoch-wise double descent, which is delayed generalization following overfitting, was empirically investigated by focusing on the evolution of internal structures. Fully connected neural networks of three different sizes were trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset with 30% label noise. By decomposing the loss curves into signal contributions from clean and noisy training data, the epoch-wise evolutions of internal signals were analyzed separately. Three main findings were obtained from this analysis. First, the model achieved strong re-generalization on test data even after perfectly fitting noisy training data during the double descent phase, corresponding to a \"benign overfitting\" state. Second, noisy data were learned after clean data, and as learning progressed, their corresponding internal activations became increasingly separated in outer layers; this enabled the model to overfit only noisy data. Third, a single, very large activation emerged in the shallow layer across all models; this phenomenon is referred as \"outliers,\" \"massive activa-tions,\" and \"super activations\" in recent large language models and evolves with re-generalization.

However, copy trading is not a guarantee of profitability due to the prevalence of manipulative bots, the uncertainty of the followed wallets' future performance, and the lag in trade execution. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in financial applications by effectively understanding multi-modal data and producing explainable decisions. However, a single LLM struggles with complex, multi-faceted tasks such as asset allocation. These challenges are even more pronounced in cryptocurrency markets, where LLMs often lack sufficient domain-specific knowledge in their training data.\n  To address these challenges, we propose an explainable multi-agent system for meme coin copy trading.

Employing few-shot chain-of-though (CoT) prompting, each agent acquires professional meme coin trading knowledge, interprets multi-modal data, and generates explainable decisions. Using a dataset of 1,000 meme coin projects' transaction data, our empirical evaluation shows that the proposed multi-agent system outperforms both traditional machine learning models and single LLMs, achieving 73% and 70% precision in identifying high-quality meme coin projects and key opinion leader (KOL) wallets, respectively.

Ten public/private radiomics datasets with varied imaging modalities (CT/MRI), sizes, anatomies and endpoints were used. Six general-purpose and five radiomics-specific frameworks were tested with predefined parameters using standardized cross-validation.

Most radiomics-specific frameworks were excluded from the performance analysis due to obsolescence, extensive programming requirements, or computational inefficiency. Conversely, general-purpose frameworks demonstrated higher accessibility and ease of implementation. Simplatab provides an effective balance of performance, efficiency, and accessibility for radiomics classification problems.

However, the lack of explainability is a true and significant challenge, especially in high-stakes domains, such as health and finance, where understanding is paramount. We propose a new solution to this challenge: an explainable AI framework based on our comparative study with Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs) and Classical Boltzmann Machines (CBMs). We leverage principles of quantum computing within classical machine learning to provide substantive transparency around decision-making. The design involves training both models on a binarised and dimensionally reduced MNIST dataset, where Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied for preprocessing. For interpretability, we employ gradient-based saliency maps in QBMs and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) in CBMs to evaluate feature attributions.QBMs deploy hybrid quantum-classical circuits with strongly entangling layers, allowing for richer latent representations, whereas CBMs serve as a classical baseline that utilises contrastive divergence. Along the way, we found that QBMs outperformed CBMs on classification accuracy (83.5% vs. 54%) and had more concentrated distributions in feature attributions as quantified by entropy (1.27 vs. 1.39). In other words, QBMs not only produced better predictive performance than CBMs, but they also provided clearer identification of \"active ingredient\" or the most important features behind model predictions. To conclude, our results illustrate that quantum-classical hybrid models can display improvements in both accuracy and interpretability, which leads us toward more trustworthy and explainable AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Inspired by the Cognitive Load Theory, we propose Prism, a novel framework for complex intent understanding that enables logically coherent and efficient intent clarification. Prism comprises four tailored modules: a complex intent decomposition module, which decomposes user intents into smaller, well-structured elements and identifies logical dependencies among them; a logical clarification generation module, which organizes clarification questions based on these dependencies to ensure coherent, low-friction interactions; an intent-aware reward module, which evaluates the quality of clarification trajectories via an intent-aware reward function and leverages Monte Carlo Sample to simulate user-LLM interactions for large-scale,high-quality training data generation; and a self-evolved intent tuning module, which iteratively refines the LLM's logical clarification capability through data-driven feedback and optimization. Prism consistently outperforms existing approaches across clarification interactions, intent execution, and cognitive load benchmarks.

Manual analysis of such large-scale data is impractical, motivating the need for automated approaches based on machine learning. Recent advances in automatic Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition (UATR) have largely relied on supervised learning, which is constrained by the scarcity of labeled data. Transfer Learning (TL) offers a promising alternative to mitigate this limitation. In this work, we conduct the first empirical comparative study of transfer learning for UATR, evaluating multiple pretrained audio models originating from diverse audio domains. The pretrained model weights are frozen, and the resulting embeddings are analyzed through classification, clustering, and similarity-based evaluations. The analysis shows that the geometrical structure of the embedding space is largely dominated by recording-specific characteristics.

Existing inference-time guidance methods can adjust sampling trajectories, but they typically optimize surrogate objectives such as classifier likelihoods rather than directly aligning with the target distribution. We propose MMD Guidance, a training-free mechanism that augments the reverse diffusion process with gradients of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between generated samples and a reference dataset. MMD provides reliable distributional estimates from limited data, exhibits low variance in practice, and is efficiently differentiable, which makes it particularly well-suited for the guidance task. Our framework naturally extends to prompt-aware adaptation in conditional generation models via product kernels.

We argue that this interpretation rests on a conceptual error. LLMs do not reason morally; they statistically internalize the record of human social interaction, including laws, contracts, negotiations, conflicts, and coercive arrangements. Behaviors commonly labeled as unethical or anomalous are therefore better understood as structural generalizations of interaction regimes that arise under extreme asymmetries of power, information, or constraint. Drawing on relational models theory, we show that practices such as blackmail are not categorical deviations from normal social behavior, but limiting cases within the same continuum that includes market pricing, authority relations, and ultimatum bargaining. The surprise elicited by such outputs reflects an anthropomorphic expectation that intelligence should reproduce only socially sanctioned behavior, rather than the full statistical landscape of behaviors humans themselves enact. Because human morality is plural, context-dependent, and historically contingent, the notion of a universally moral artificial intelligence is ill-defined. We therefore reframe concerns about artificial general intelligence (AGI). The primary risk is not adversarial intent, but AGI's role as an endogenous amplifier of human intelligence, power, and contradiction. By eliminating longstanding cognitive and institutional frictions, AGI compresses timescales and removes the historical margin of error that has allowed inconsistent values and governance regimes to persist without collapse. Alignment failure is thus structural, not accidental, and requires governance approaches that address amplification, complexity, and regime stability rather than model-level intent alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We propose and rigorously justify the \\emph{coverage improvement principle}: with sufficient batch size, each update moves into a region around the target where coverage is uniformly better, making subsequent data increasingly informative and enabling rapid convergence. In the contextual bandit setting with Bradley-Terry preferences and linear softmax policy class, we show that on-policy DPO converges exponentially in the number of iterations for batch size exceeding a generalized coverage threshold. In contrast, any learner restricted to offline samples from the initial policy suffers a slower minimax rate, leading to a sharp separation in total sample complexity. Motivated by this analysis, we further propose a simple hybrid sampler based on a novel \\emph{preferential} G-optimal design, which removes dependence on coverage and guarantees convergence in just two rounds. Finally, we develop principled on-policy schemes for reward distillation in the general function class setting, and show faster noiseless rates under an alternative deviation-based notion of coverage.

A signed-distance-based weighting further stabilizes least-squares learning on irregular geometries.

Although RL agents can converge to optimal solutions, the definition of ``optimality'' depends on the environment's statistical properties. The Bellman equation, central to most RL algorithms, is formulated in terms of expected values of future rewards. However, when ergodicity is broken, long-term outcomes depend on the specific trajectory rather than on the ensemble average. In such settings, the ensemble average diverges from the time-average growth experienced by individual agents, with expected-value formulations yielding systematically suboptimal policies. Prior studies demonstrated that traditional RL architectures fail to recover the true optimum in non-ergodic environments. We extend this analysis to deep RL implementations and show that these, too, produce suboptimal policies under non-ergodic dynamics. Introducing explicit time dependence into the learning process can correct this limitation. By allowing the network's function approximation to incorporate temporal information, the agent can estimate value functions consistent with the process's intrinsic growth rate. This improvement does not require altering the environmental feedback, such as reward transformations or modified objective functions, but arises naturally from the agent's exposure to temporal trajectories.

In MLC, label noise arises as additive noise, subtractive noise, or a combination of both in the form of mixed noise. Previous work has largely overlooked this distinction and commonly treats noisy annotations as supervised signals, lacking mechanisms that explicitly adapt learning behavior to different noise types. To address this limitation, we propose NAR, a noise-adaptive regularization method that explicitly distinguishes between additive and subtractive noise within a semi-supervised learning framework. NAR employs a confidence-based label handling mechanism that dynamically retains label entries with high confidence, temporarily deactivates entries with moderate confidence, and corrects low confidence entries via flipping. This selective attenuation of supervision is integrated with early-learning regularization (ELR) to stabilize training and mitigate overfitting to corrupted labels.

First (Modality Gap), distribution shifts induce gaps between visual and textual modalities, making cross-modal relations inaccurate. Second (Visual Nuisance), visual embeddings encode rich but task-irrelevant noise that often overwhelms task-specific semantics under distribution shifts.

Traditional radiomics rely on predefined features chosen at the population level; while more interpretable, they are often too restrictive to capture patient-specific variability and can underperform end-to-end deep learning (DL). To address this, we propose two complementary strategies that bring individuality and interpretability: radiomic fingerprints and healthy personas. First, a radiomic fingerprint is a dynamically constructed, patient-specific feature set derived from MRI. Instead of applying a uniform population-level signature, our model predicts feature relevance from a pool of candidate features and selects only those most predictive for each patient, while maintaining feature-level interpretability. This fingerprint can be viewed as a latent-variable model of feature usage, where an image-conditioned predictor estimates usage probabilities and a transparent logistic regression with global coefficients performs classification. Second, a healthy persona synthesises a pathology-free baseline for each patient using a diffusion model trained to reconstruct healthy knee MRIs. Comparing features extracted from pathological images against their personas highlights deviations from normal anatomy, enabling intuitive, case-specific explanations of disease manifestations. We systematically compare fingerprints, personas, and their combination across three clinical tasks.

To address these limitations, we propose HIPPO, a general holistic-aware parallel speculative decoding framework.

Moreover, Overflow represents a practical vector for compute amplification and service degradation in shared environments. We introduce BenchOverflow, a model-agnostic benchmark of nine plain-text prompting strategies that amplify output volume without adversarial suffixes or policy circumvention.

We revisit this problem from a wave-based perspective: feature maps are treated as spatial signals whose evolution over an internal propagation time (aligned with network depth) is governed by an underdamped wave equation. In this formulation, spatial frequency-from low-frequency global layout to high-frequency edges and textures-is modeled explicitly, and its interaction with propagation time is controlled rather than implicitly fixed. We derive a closed-form, frequency-time decoupled solution and implement it as the Wave Propagation Operator (WPO), a lightweight module that models global interactions in O(N log N) time-far lower than attention. Building on WPO, we propose a family of WaveFormer models as drop-in replacements for standard ViTs and CNNs, achieving competitive accuracy across image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, while delivering up to 1.6x higher throughput and 30% fewer FLOPs than attention-based alternatives. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that wave propagation introduces a complementary modeling bias to heat-based methods, effectively capturing both global coherence and high-frequency details essential for rich visual semantics.

Experiments on Qwen3-8B and 32B models across four challenging web agent benchmarks demonstrate that ExpSeek achieves absolute improvements of 9.3% and 7.5%, respectively.

In social psychology, however, political ideology is also understood as a downstream consequence of fundamental moral intuitions. In this work, we investigate the causal relationship between moral values and political positioning by treating moral orientation as a controllable condition. Rather than simply assigning a demographic persona, we condition models to endorse or reject specific moral values and evaluate the resulting shifts on their political orientations, using the Political Compass Test. By treating moral values as lenses, we observe how moral conditioning actively steers model trajectories across economic and social dimensions. Our findings show that such conditioning induces pronounced, value-specific shifts in models' political coordinates. We further notice that these effects are systematically modulated by role framing and model scale, and are robust across alternative assessment instruments instantiating the same moral value. This highlights that effective alignment requires anchoring political assessments within the context of broader social values including morality, paving the way for more socially grounded alignment techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Moreover, many implementations are not publicly available, and the optimal configuration for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) lesion segmentation remains unclear. In this work, we introduce ISLA (Ischemic Stroke Lesion Analyzer), a new deep learning model for AIS lesion segmentation from diffusion MRI, trained on three multicenter databases totaling more than 1500 AIS participants. Through systematic optimization of the loss function, convolutional architecture, deep supervision, and attention mechanisms, we developed a robust segmentation framework.

To address this inefficiency, we propose precomputing table representations as KV caches offline and querying the required ones online. A key aspect of our approach is the computation of table caches while preserving primary foreign key relationships between tables. Additionally, we construct a Table Trie structure to facilitate efficient KV cache lookups during inference. To enhance cache performance, we introduce a cache management system with a query reranking strategy to improve cache hit rates and a computation loading pipeline for parallelizing model inference and cache loading.

To address these limitations, we introduce Agentic Context Evolution (ACE), a framework inspired by human metacognition that dynamically determines whether to seek new evidence or reason with existing knowledge. ACE employs a central orchestrator agent to make decisions strategically via majority voting.It aims to alternate between activating a retriever agent for external retrieval and a reasoner agent for internal analysis and refinement. By eliminating redundant retrieval steps, ACE maintains a concise and evolved context. Extensive experiments on challenging multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that ACE significantly outperforms competitive baselines in accuracy while achieving efficient token consumption.Our work provides valuable insights into advancing context-evolved generation for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

UR-Bench comprises two major categories, Humanistic Scenes and Natural Scenes, covering four subsets of ultra-high-resolution images with distinct spatial structures and data sources. Each subset contains images ranging from hundreds of megapixels to gigapixels, accompanied by questions organized into three levels, enabling evaluation of models' reasoning capabilities in ultra-high-resolution scenarios.
