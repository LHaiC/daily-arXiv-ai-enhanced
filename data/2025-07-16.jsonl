An equilibrium consists of prices,\ncompensations, tips, and transactions that clear the market, such that buyers\nreceive deliveries from preferred stores considering the prices and tips they\npay, and couriers deliver preferred orders considering the compensations and\ntips they receive.\n  We illustrate the role of tips in pricing: Without tips, an equilibrium is\nonly guaranteed to exist when there are at least as many couriers as buyers or\nstores. In contrast, with tips an equilibrium always exists. From an efficiency\nperspective, the optimal with-tip equilibrium welfare is always weakly larger\nthan the optimal without-tip equilibrium welfare.

Robust Minimum\nRedundancy Arrays (RMRAs), a specialized class of TFRAs, optimize this\nredundancy to achieve the maximum possible aperture for a given number of\nsensors.

The robustness of these arrays was\nvalidated under all single-element failure scenarios using MATLAB simulations,\nconfirming their superior resilience compared to some existing TFRAs vulnerable\nto failures at specific sensor positions.

Foundational\ndatasets are evaluated using a novel criterion based on task complexity,\nvariety of modalities, and dataset scale, allowing a comparative analysis of\ntheir suitability for generalist policy learning. We introduce a\ntwo-dimensional characterization framework that organizes these datasets based\non semantic richness and multimodal alignment, showing underexplored regions in\nthe current data landscape. Simulation environments are evaluated for their\neffectiveness in generating large-scale data, as well as their ability to\nfacilitate transfer from simulation to real-world settings and the variety of\nsupported tasks. Using both academic and industrial contributions, we recognize\nongoing challenges and outline strategic directions such as scalable\npretraining protocols, modular architectural design, and robust multimodal\nalignment strategies.

This paper\nfocuses on the application of LLMs to switched-mode power supply (SMPS) design\non printed circuit boards (PCBs). Particular challenges for LLMs in this\ncontext include their limited ability to interpret results from key simulation\ntools like SPICE and the multi-step design process. To address these\nchallenges, we suggest SPICEAssistant, a framework that provides a broad\nselection of tools to an LLM. The tools serve as an interface to SPICE,\nallowing the LLM to interact flexibly with the simulator to estimate the impact\nof its modifications to the circuit. To evaluate the performance of\nSPICEAssistant, we defined a benchmark consisting of 256 questions testing the\nability to adapt circuit netlists to fulfil different SMPS design tasks. The\nbenchmarking results show that simulation feedback effectively improves SMPS\ndesign capabilities of LLMs. An increasing number of simulation iterations\nleads to enhanced performance.

Previous works in unseen\nobject instance segmentation (UOIS) train models on large-scale datasets, which\noften leads to overfitting on static visual features. This dependency results\nin poor generalization performance when confronted with out-of-distribution\nscenarios. To address this limitation, we rethink the task of UOIS based on the\nprinciple that vision is inherently interactive and occurs over time. We\npropose a novel real-time interactive perception framework, rt-RISeg, that\ncontinuously segments unseen objects by robot interactions and analysis of a\ndesigned body frame-invariant feature (BFIF). We demonstrate that the relative\nrotational and linear velocities of randomly sampled body frames, resulting\nfrom selected robot interactions, can be used to identify objects without any\nlearned segmentation model. This fully self-contained segmentation pipeline\ngenerates and updates object segmentation masks throughout each robot\ninteraction without the need to wait for an action to finish.

This has sparked\nsignificant investment and interest, particularly in building data centers with\nthe necessary hardware and software to develop and operate AI models and\nAI-based workflows. In this technical review article, we present energy\nconsumption scenarios of data centers and impact on GHG emissions, considering\nboth near-term projections (up to 2030) and long-term outlook (2035 and\nbeyond). We address the quintessential question of whether AI will have a net\npositive, neutral, or negative impact on CO2 emissions by 2035. Additionally,\nwe discuss AI's potential to automate, create efficient and disruptive\nworkflows across various fields related to energy production, supply and\nconsumption. In the near-term scenario, the growing demand for AI will likely\nstrain computing resources, lead to increase in electricity consumption and\ntherefore associated CO2 emissions. This is due to the power-hungry nature of\nbig data centers and the requirements for training and running of large and\ncomplex AI models, as well as the penetration of AI assistant search and\napplications for public use. However, the long-term outlook could be more\npromising. AI has the potential to be a game-changer in CO2 reduction.

The Spatial Web is\nmissing a key ingredient that is impeding its growth -- a spatial naming system\nto resolve real-world locations to names. Today's spatial naming systems are\ndigital maps such as Google and Apple maps. These maps and the location-based\nservices provided on top of these maps are primarily controlled by a few large\ncorporations and mostly cover outdoor public spaces. Emerging classes of\napplications, such as persistent world-scale augmented reality, require\ndetailed maps of both outdoor and indoor spaces. Existing centralized mapping\ninfrastructures are proving insufficient for such applications because of the\nscale of cartography efforts required and the privacy of indoor map data.\n  In this paper, we present a case for a federated spatial naming system, or in\nother words, a federated mapping infrastructure. This enables disparate parties\nto manage and serve their own maps of physical regions and unlocks scalability\nof map management, isolation and privacy of maps. Map-related services such as\naddress-to-location mapping, location-based search, and routing needs\nre-architecting to work on federated maps.

However, label noise, which\narises from inter-institutional data variability, can cause training\ninstability and degrade model performance. Existing FL methods struggle with\nnoise heterogeneity and the imbalance in medical data. Motivated by these\nchallenges, we propose FedGSCA, a novel framework for enhancing robustness in\nnoisy medical FL. FedGSCA introduces a Global Sample Selector that aggregates\nnoise knowledge from all clients, effectively addressing noise heterogeneity\nand improving global model stability. Furthermore, we develop a Client Adaptive\nAdjustment (CAA) mechanism that combines adaptive threshold pseudo-label\ngeneration and Robust Credal Labeling Loss. CAA dynamically adjusts to class\ndistributions, ensuring the inclusion of minority samples and carefully\nmanaging noisy labels by considering multiple plausible labels. This dual\napproach mitigates the impact of noisy data and prevents overfitting during\nlocal training, which improves the generalizability of the model. We evaluate\nFedGSCA on one real-world colon slides dataset and two synthetic medical\ndatasets under various noise conditions, including symmetric, asymmetric,\nextreme, and heterogeneous types. The results show that FedGSCA outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods, excelling in extreme and heterogeneous noise\nscenarios.

As such,\ndigital-to-analog converters (DACs) are becoming a bottleneck in terms of\nhardware complexity and power consumption. In this work, non-linear precoding\nfor coarsely quantized downlink massive MIMO is studied. Given the NP-hard\nnature of this problem, a graph neural network (GNN) is proposed that directly\noutputs the precoded quantized vector based on the channel matrix and the\nintended transmit symbols. The model is trained in a self-supervised manner, by\ndirectly maximizing the achievable rate. To overcome the non-differentiability\nof the objective function, introduced due to the non-differentiable DAC\nfunctions, a straight-through Gumbel-softmax estimation of the gradient is\nproposed. The proposed method achieves a significant increase in achievable sum\nrate under coarse quantization. For instance, in the single-user case, the\nproposed method can achieve the same sum rate as maximum ratio transmission\n(MRT) by using one-bit DAC's as compared to 3 bits for MRT. This reduces the\nDAC's power consumption by a factor 4-7 and 3 for baseband and RF DACs\nrespectively. This, however, comes at the cost of increased digital signal\nprocessing power consumption. When accounting for this, the reduction in\noverall power consumption holds for a system bandwidth up to 3.5 MHz for\nbaseband DACs, while the RF DACs can maintain a power reduction of 2.9 for\nhigher bandwidths.

In addition to surprisingly generic\nconvergence features of the Pauli coefficient distributions, we find certain\nregularities that allow for extrapolation of memory and runtime requirements\nfor smaller and smaller coefficient truncation parameter $\\delta$. We then\nintroduce a framework for understanding convergence in the absence of rigorous\nerror guarantees on PPS.

This\nserves as a way for practitioners to understand where their problem falls on\nthe frontier of classical simulability. In the case without apparent\nconvergence, PPS may still serve useful as a Monte Carlo-like estimate.

A natural question is how quantum\nresources such as entanglement and contextuality amongst physical qubits in the\nlaboratory are utilized in LF simulations of QFTs. We use the (1+1)D\ntransverse-field Ising model to explore this question. We derive the LF energy\noperator that generates the LF dynamics of the system, which is distinct from\nthe instant-form (IF) Hamiltonian. We find that while the eigenstates of the IF\nHamiltonian exhibit pairwise entanglement between positive and negative momenta\nin IF momentum-space, the eigenstates of the LF Hamiltonian are separable in LF\nmomentum-space. We then calculate the momentum-space magic of the\nIF-momentum-space ground state and show that it always requires more magic to\nprepare than the LF-momentum-space ground state. At the quantum critical point,\ncorresponding to a massless free fermion, both LF and IF ground states are\nstabilizers, but the LF ground state is separable in LF momentum-space while\nthe IF ground state is a product of maximally entangled pairs in IF\nmomentum-space. These results show that quantum resources such as entanglement\nand magic are utilized differently by quantum simulations formulated in LF and\nIF, and that the simplicity of the LF ground state results in fewer required\nquantum resources."}

To address\nthis, FootGait3D consists of 8,403 point cloud frames collected from 46\nsubjects using a custom five-camera depth sensing system.

Previous works in unseen\nobject instance segmentation (UOIS) train models on large-scale datasets, which\noften leads to overfitting on static visual features. This dependency results\nin poor generalization performance when confronted with out-of-distribution\nscenarios. To address this limitation, we rethink the task of UOIS based on the\nprinciple that vision is inherently interactive and occurs over time. We\npropose a novel real-time interactive perception framework, rt-RISeg, that\ncontinuously segments unseen objects by robot interactions and analysis of a\ndesigned body frame-invariant feature (BFIF). We demonstrate that the relative\nrotational and linear velocities of randomly sampled body frames, resulting\nfrom selected robot interactions, can be used to identify objects without any\nlearned segmentation model. This fully self-contained segmentation pipeline\ngenerates and updates object segmentation masks throughout each robot\ninteraction without the need to wait for an action to finish. We showcase the\neffectiveness of our proposed interactive perception method by achieving an\naverage object segmentation accuracy rate 27.5% greater than state-of-the-art\nUOIS methods. Furthermore, although rt-RISeg is a standalone framework, we show\nthat the autonomously generated segmentation masks can be used as prompts to\nvision foundation models for significantly improved performance."}

However, we reveal that the progressive compensation\nprocess introduces accumulated first-order deviations between latent weights\nand their full-precision counterparts, making this assumption fundamentally\nflawed. To address this, we propose FOEM, a novel PTQ method that explicitly\nincorporates first-order gradient terms to improve quantization error\ncompensation. FOEM approximates gradients by directly computing the difference\nbetween latent and full-precision weights, avoiding the high cost and limited\ngeneralization of backpropagation-based gradient computation. This approach\nintroduces minimal additional computational overhead. Moreover, FOEM leverages\nprecomputed Cholesky factors to efficiently recover the inverse of Hessian\nsubmatrices in real time. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models\nand benchmarks demonstrate that FOEM consistently outperforms the classical\nGPTQ method. In 3-bit weight-only quantization, FOEM reduces the perplexity of\nLlama3-8B by 89.6%, and improves the 5-shot MMLU accuracy of Llama3-70B from\n51.7% to 74.9%, approaching the full-precision performance of 78.6%.\nFurthermore, FOEM can be seamlessly integrated with advanced techniques such as\nGPTAQ and SpinQuant, yielding additional improvements under the challenging\nW4A4KV4 setting, and further narrowing the accuracy gap with full-precision\nbaselines beyond what current state-of-the-art methods achieve.

In this work we focus on\nits adaptations, which aim to fine-tune pre-trained models to perform specific\ndownstream tasks, like medical data generation. While for DMs there exist many\ntechniques, adaptations for VAR remain underexplored. Similarly, differentially\nprivate (DP) adaptations-ones that aim to preserve privacy of the adaptation\ndata-have been extensively studied for DMs, while VAR lacks such solutions. In\nour work, we implement and benchmark many strategies for VAR, and compare them\nto state-of-the-art DM adaptation strategies. We observe that VAR outperforms\nDMs for non-DP adaptations, however, the performance of DP suffers, which\nnecessitates further research in private adaptations for VAR.

Elk structures these performance factors into\nconfigurable parameters and forms a global trade-off space in the DL compiler.\nTo systematically explore this space and maximize overall efficiency, Elk\nemploys a new inductive operator scheduling policy and a cost-aware on-chip\nmemory allocation algorithm.

Conventional\ntechniques frequently fail to preserve critical image details, while\ndata-driven approaches exhibit limited generalizability. Implicit Neural\nRepresentations (INRs) present a promising alternative by learning continuous\nmappings from spatial coordinates to pixel intensities for individual images,\nthereby storing network weights rather than raw pixels and avoiding the\ngeneralization problem. However, INR-based compression of large images faces\nchallenges including slow compression speed and suboptimal compression ratios.\nTo address these limitations, we introduce COLI (Compressor for Large Images),\na novel framework leveraging Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV). First,\nrecognizing that INR-based compression constitutes a training process, we\naccelerate its convergence through a pretraining-finetuning paradigm,\nmixed-precision training, and reformulation of the sequential loss into a\nparallelizable objective. Second, capitalizing on INRs' transformation of image\nstorage constraints into weight storage, we implement Hyper-Compression, a\nnovel post-training technique to substantially enhance compression ratios while\nmaintaining minimal output distortion. Evaluations across two medical imaging\ndatasets demonstrate that COLI consistently achieves competitive or superior\nPSNR and SSIM metrics at significantly reduced bits per pixel (bpp), while\naccelerating NeRV training by up to 4 times."}

The proposed\nmodel uses fuzzy sets and logic to create a framework for color categorization.\nUsing a three-phase experimental approach, the study first identifies\ndistinguishable color stimuli for hue, saturation, and intensity through\npreliminary experiments, followed by a large-scale human categorization survey\ninvolving more than 1000 human subjects. The resulting data are used to extract\nfuzzy partitions and generate membership functions that reflect real-world\nperceptual uncertainty.
