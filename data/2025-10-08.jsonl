Here, we address this challenge by\ndeveloping a causal modeling framework that (i) simulates the possible network\npathways that emerge as contagions spread and (ii) identifies which edges and\nnodes are most impactful on diffusion across these possible pathways. This\nyields a surprising discovery. If people require exposure to multiple peers to\nadopt a contagion (a.k.a., 'complex contagions'), the pathways that emerge\noften only work in one direction. In fact, the more complex a contagion is, the\nmore asymmetric its paths become. This emergent directedness problematizes\ncanonical theories of how networks mediate contagion. Weak ties spanning\nnetwork regions - widely thought to facilitate mutual influence and integration\n- prove to privilege the spread contagions from one community to the other.\nEmergent directedness also disproportionately channels complex contagions from\nthe network periphery to the core, inverting standard centrality models. We\ndemonstrate two practical applications. We show that emergent directedness\naccounts for unexplained nonlinearity in the effects of tie strength in a\nrecent study of job diffusion over LinkedIn. Lastly, we show that network\nevolution is biased toward growing directed paths, but that cultural factors\n(e.g., triadic closure) can curtail this bias, with strategic implications for\nnetwork building and behavioral interventions."}

This paper\nintroduces Teamwork: a flexible and efficient unified solution for jointly\nincreasing the number of input and output channels as well as adapting a\npretrained diffusion model to new tasks. Teamwork achieves channel expansion\nwithout altering the pretrained diffusion model architecture by coordinating\nand adapting multiple instances of the base diffusion model (\\ie, teammates).\nWe employ a novel variation of Low Rank-Adaptation (LoRA) to jointly address\nboth adaptation and coordination between the different teammates. Furthermore\nTeamwork supports dynamic (de)activation of teammates. We demonstrate the\nflexibility and efficiency of Teamwork on a variety of generative and inverse\ngraphics tasks such as inpainting, single image SVBRDF estimation, intrinsic\ndecomposition, neural shading, and intrinsic image synthesis."}

Existing frameworks often intertwine inference, memory,\nand control in a single prompt, which can reduce coherence and predictability.\nThe Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) is introduced as an alternative\narchitecture that separates these functions. In SCL, the language model is\ndedicated to inference, memory is maintained externally, and execution is\nguided by a lightweight controller within a goal-directed loop. This design\noffloads cognitive load from the model and allows intermediate results to be\nstored, revisited, and checked before actions are taken, providing a clearer\nbasis for traceability and evaluation.\n  We evaluate SCL against prompt-based baselines including ReAct and common\nLangChain agents across three scenarios: temperature-based travel planning,\nemail drafting with conditional send, and constraint-guided image generation.\nAll systems share the same base model and tools under matched decoding\nsettings. Across 360 episodes, SCL shows modest but consistent improvements.\nTask success averages 86.3 percent compared with 70-77 percent for baselines.\nGoal fidelity is higher, redundant calls are fewer, intermediate states are\nreused more reliably, and unsupported assertions per 100 tool calls are\nreduced. Ablations show that external memory and control each contribute\nindependently, and decoding sweeps confirm stability of the effects.\n  These results suggest that architectural separation can improve reliability\nand traceability without relying on larger models or heavier prompts.

We measure the retardance of a diamond substrate in\ntwo orientations: perpendicular and parallel to the growth direction. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that the correlation between mean retardance\nand thickness differs for these orientations. When measured perpendicular to\nthe growth direction, the mean retardance is approximately proportional to the\nsquare root of the substrate thickness. In contrast, when measured parallel to\nthe growth direction, we observe a generally higher mean retardance and an\napproximately linear correlation with thickness. This anisotropy arises not\nfrom differences in stress magnitude but from differences in the interlayer\ncorrelation of the principal stress axes, as evidenced by correlation\ncoefficients between the azimuth angles of consecutive layers in the diamond\ncrystal. To simulate the integrated retardance of diamond wafers, we propose a\ntwo-dimensional random walk model with momentum drift, which captures the\ndiamond crystal tendency to preserve the azimuth angle across the samples.

Yet, they are almost\nalways executed monolithically, which underutilizes the heterogeneous\naccelerators (NPUs, GPUs, DSPs) in modern SoCs and leads to high end-to-end\nlatency. In this paper, we present NANOMIND, a hardware--software co-design\ninference framework for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that breaks large models\ninto modular ``bricks'' (vision, language, audio, etc.) and maps each to its\nideal accelerator. The key insight is that large models can be broken into\nmodular components and scheduled to run on the most appropriate compute units.\nIt performs module-level dynamic offloading across accelerators on\nunified-memory SoCs. By combining customized hardware design, system-level\nscheduling, and optimized low-bit computation kernels, we demonstrate our\nframework with a compact, battery-powered device capable of running LMMs\nentirely on device. This prototype functions as a self-contained intelligent\nassistant that requires no network connectivity, while achieving higher\nthroughput and superior power efficiency under strict resource constraints.

When performed in\neither a specialized scanning transmission electron microscope or ultrafast\nelectron microscope (UEM), time-resolved and ultrafast EELS can directly image\ncharge carriers, lattice vibrations, and heat dissipation following\nphotoexcitation or applied bias. Yet recent advances in theoretical\ncalculations and electron optics are often required to realize the full\npotential of ultrafast EEL spectrum imaging. In this review, we present a\ncomprehensive overview of the recent progress in the theory and instrumentation\nof time-resolved and ultrafast EELS. We begin with an introduction to the\ntechnique, followed by a physical description of the loss function. We outline\napproaches for calculating and interpreting ground-state and transient EEL\nspectra spanning low-loss plasmons to core-level excitations analogous to X-ray\nabsorption. We then survey the current state of time-resolved and ultrafast\nEELS techniques beyond photon-induced near-field electron microscopy,\nhighlighting abilities to image carrier and thermal dynamics. Finally, we\nexamine future directions enabled by emerging technologies, including electron\nbeam monochromation, in situ and operando cells, laser-free UEM, and high-speed\ndirect electron detectors. These advances position time-resolved and ultrafast\nEELS as a critical tool for uncovering nanoscale dynamic processes in quantum\nmaterials and solar energy conversion devices."}

The framework consists of six layers: perception, semantic annotation,\ninteroperability, transportation, semantic reasoning, and application, suitable\nfor dynamic environments. Sensors collect data in the form of voltage, which is\nthen processed by microprocessors or microcontrollers in the semantic\nannotation and preprocessing layer. Metadata is added to the raw data,\nincluding the purpose, ID number, and application. Two semantic algorithms are\nproposed in the semantic interoperability and ontologies layer: the\ninteroperability semantic algorithm for standardizing file types and the\nsynonym identification algorithm for identifying synonyms. In the\ntransportation layer, raw data and metadata are sent to other IoT devices or\ncloud computing platforms using techniques like WiFi, Zigbee networks,\nBluetooth, and mobile communication networks. A semantic reasoning layer is\nproposed to infer new knowledge from the existing data, using fuzzy logic,\nDempster-Shafer theory, and Bayesian networks. A Graphical User Interface (GUI)\nis proposed in the application layer to help users communicate with and monitor\nIoT sensors, devices, and new knowledge inferred.

Such results raise a crucial question for both capability\nand safety forecasting: how can one accurately predict a model's behavior when\nscaled to a massive number of attempts, given a vastly smaller sampling budget?\nThis question is directly relevant to model providers, who serve hundreds of\nmillions of users daily, and to governmental regulators, who seek to prevent\nharms. To answer this questions, we make three contributions. First, we find\nthat standard methods for fitting these laws suffer from statistical\nshortcomings that hinder predictive accuracy, especially in data-limited\nscenarios. Second, we remedy these shortcomings by introducing a robust\nestimation framework, which uses a beta-binomial distribution to generate more\naccurate predictions from limited data. Third, we propose a dynamic sampling\nstrategy that allocates a greater budget to harder problems. Combined, these\ninnovations enable more reliable prediction of rare risks and capabilities at a\nfraction of the computational cost."}

By\noptimizing the momentum factor, we show that the model can closely match\nexperimental data. The momentum factor is found higher along the growth\ndirection, which is consistent with the calculated correlation coefficients.\nFurthermore, both the model and experiments indicate that\nretardance-to-thickness ratios of thin samples converge toward similar base\nretardances in both orientations. These findings establish a quantitative\nframework for interpreting birefringence in diamond substrates, with\nimplications for material selection and development in thermal management,\nquantum sensing, high-power electronics, and optical applications."}

This paper presents a controlled empirical\nstudy examining model performance, calibration, and output characteristics when\ntrained on varying synthetic-to-external data ratios. Using the Pythia model\nsuite (410M-12B parameters) across five diverse tasks, we evaluate models after\none to three training iterations with synthetic data proportions ranging from\n0-50\\%. Our key findings include: models maintain stable performance with up to\n20\\% synthetic data, but degradation accelerates beyond 30\\%; larger models\n(6.9B-12B) show greater robustness to synthetic data than smaller models\n(410M-1.4B); calibration degradation precedes accuracy loss, providing an early\nwarning signal; and task characteristics matter, with reasoning tasks degrading\nfaster than retrieval tasks under synthetic data training.

Though prior\nwork has focused on automating retrieval and screening, the writing phase of\nsystematic reviews remains largely under-explored, especially with regard to\nreadability and factual accuracy. To address this, we present LiRA (Literature\nReview Agents), a multi-agent collaborative workflow which emulates the human\nliterature review process. LiRA utilizes specialized agents for content\noutlining, subsection writing, editing, and reviewing, producing cohesive and\ncomprehensive review articles. Evaluated on SciReviewGen and a proprietary\nScienceDirect dataset, LiRA outperforms current baselines such as AutoSurvey\nand MASS-Survey in writing and citation quality, while maintaining competitive\nsimilarity to human-written reviews. We further evaluate LiRA in real-world\nscenarios using document retrieval and assess its robustness to reviewer model\nvariation. Our findings highlight the potential of agentic LLM workflows, even\nwithout domain-specific tuning, to improve the reliability and usability of\nautomated scientific writing."}

We show that inclusion of dielectric\nscreening due to hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) encapsulation is essential to\nreproduce the full set of experimentally observed features of moir\\'e\nintralayer excitons. Our analysis reveals a competition between Wannier and\ncharge transfer characters, driven by variations between direct and indirect\nband gaps at high symmetry stacking regions due to atomic relaxations and\nenvironmentally tunable electron-hole interactions.

Therefore, how to\nefficiently and conveniently determine the number and form of the dark states\nin multilevel quantum systems with complex transitions is an important and\ninteresting topic in this field. In this work, we present a general theory for\ndetermining the dark states in multilevel quantum systems with any coupling\nconfiguration using the arrowhead-matrix method. To confirm the dark states in\na multilevel system, we first define the upper- and lower-state subspaces, and\nthen diagonalize the Hamiltonians restricted within the two subspaces to obtain\nthe dressed upper and lower states. By further expressing the transitions\nbetween the dressed upper and lower states, we can map the multilevel system to\na bipartite-graph network, in which the nodes and links are acted by the\ndressed states and transitions, respectively. Based on the coupling\nconfigurations of the network, we can determine the lower dark states with\nrespect to the upper-state subspace.

Commonly used\nexpectation-maximization (EM) methods offer flexibility in fitting latent\nmodels but are highly sensitive to initialization and prone to poor local\nminima. Here, we propose a tensor-based method that provides identifiability\nguarantees for learning MoLDS, which is followed by EM updates to combine the\nstrengths of both approaches.

The runtime of our algorithm\ndepends polynomially on the sparsity of the augmented matrix $H = [A,\n-\\vec{b}]$, the inverse precision, the $\\ell_2$ norm of the solution $\\vec{y} =\nA^+ \\vec{b}$, and a new instance-dependent parameter \\[ ET= \\sum_{i=1}^M p_i^2\n\\cdot d_i, \\] where $\\vec{p} = (AA^{\\top})^+ \\vec{b}$, and $d_i$ denotes the\nsquared $\\ell_2$ norm of the $i$-th row of $H$.

Their\ndistinctive decoding mechanism enables faster inference speed and strong\nperformance in code generation and mathematical tasks. In this work, we show\nthat the decoding mechanism of dLLMs not only enhances model utility but also\ncan be used as a powerful tool for model attribution. A key challenge in this\nproblem lies in the diversity of attribution scenarios, including\ndistinguishing between different models as well as between different\ncheckpoints or backups of the same model. To ensure broad applicability, we\nidentify two fundamental problems: what information to extract from the\ndecoding trajectory, and how to utilize it effectively. We first observe that\nrelying directly on per-step model confidence yields poor performance. This is\nmainly due to the bidirectional decoding nature of dLLMs: each newly decoded\ntoken influences the confidence of other decoded tokens, making model\nconfidence highly redundant and washing out structural signal regarding\ndecoding order or dependencies. To overcome this, we propose a novel\ninformation extraction scheme called the Directed Decoding Map (DDM), which\ncaptures structural relationships between decoding steps and better reveals\nmodel-specific behaviors. Furthermore, to make full use of the extracted\nstructural information during attribution, we propose Gaussian-Trajectory\nAttribution (GTA), where we fit a cell-wise Gaussian distribution at each\ndecoding position for each target model, and define the likelihood of a\ntrajectory as the attribution score: if a trajectory exhibits higher\nlog-likelihood under the distribution of a specific model, it is more likely to\nhave been generated by that model. Extensive experiments under different\nsettings validate the utility of our methods."}

In this work, we present and validate a vision-guided robotic\nframework that uses data from an end-effector mounted RGB-D sensor and combines\n3D plant reconstruction, targeted grasp planning, and physics-based vibration\nmodeling to enable precise pollination. First, the plant is reconstructed in 3D\nand registered to the robot coordinate frame to identify obstacle-free grasp\nposes along the main stem. Second, a discrete elastic rod model predicts the\nrelationship between actuation parameters and flower dynamics, guiding the\nselection of optimal pollination strategies. Finally, a manipulator with soft\ngrippers grasps the stem and applies controlled vibrations to induce pollen\nrelease. End-to-end experiments demonstrate a 92.5\\% main-stem grasping success\nrate, and simulation-guided optimization of vibration parameters further\nvalidates the feasibility of our approach, ensuring that the robot can safely\nand effectively perform pollination without damaging the flower.

Infrequent communication strategies (e.g., Local SGD) reduce this\noverhead but, when applied to adaptive optimizers, often suffer a performance\ngap relative to fully synchronous DDP. We trace this gap to a time-scale\nmismatch: the optimizer's fast-moving momentum, tuned for frequent updates,\ndecays too quickly to smooth gradients over long intervals, leading to\nnoise-dominated optimization. To address this, we propose MT-DAO, a family of\noptimizers that employs multiple slow- and fast-moving first momenta or the\ngradient to track update dynamics across different time scales, for which we\nprovide the first convergence guarantees. Empirically, for language-model\npre-training, this eliminates the performance gap with DDP, outperforming\ninfrequent-communication baselines in perplexity and reducing iso-token\nwall-clock time by 6-27% on Ethernet interconnects.

Third, trend-smoothing significantly enhances\nthe performance of proton+X-ray models by mitigating fluctuations in the X-ray\nchannel. Fourth, while models trained on trendsmoothed data perform best on\naverage, the best-performing model was trained on original data, suggesting\nthat architectural choices can sometimes outweigh the benefits of data\npreprocessing."}

In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which\ninevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to\ndirectly model \"object\" as the visual equivalence of \"word,\" pushing the model\nto learn the global context and semantics among visual elements.

We begin\nwith PINNs, which embed governing equations into deep learning models and have\nbeen successfully applied to biosolid and biofluid mechanics, mechanobiology,\nand medical imaging among other areas. We then review NODEs, which offer\ncontinuous-time modeling, especially suited to dynamic physiological systems,\npharmacokinetics, and cell signaling. Finally, we discuss deep NOs as powerful\ntools for learning mappings between function spaces, enabling efficient\nsimulations across multiscale and spatially heterogeneous biological domains.\nThroughout, we emphasize applications where physical interpretability, data\nscarcity, or system complexity make conventional black-box learning\ninsufficient. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future directions\nfor advancing PIML in biomedical science and engineering, including issues of\nuncertainty quantification, generalization, and integration of PIML and large\nlanguage models."}

Accordingly, recent\nefforts often focus on evaluating and improving LLMs' retrieval performance: if\nretrieval is perfect, a model should, in principle, perform just as well on a\nlong input as it does on a short one -- or should it? This paper presents\nfindings that the answer to this question may be negative. Our systematic\nexperiments across 5 open- and closed-source LLMs on math, question answering,\nand coding tasks reveal that, even when models can perfectly retrieve all\nrelevant information, their performance still degrades substantially\n(13.9%--85%) as input length increases but remains well within the models'\nclaimed lengths. This failure occurs even when the irrelevant tokens are\nreplaced with minimally distracting whitespace, and, more surprisingly, when\nthey are all masked and the models are forced to attend only to the relevant\ntokens. A similar performance drop is observed when all relevant evidence is\nplaced immediately before the question. Our findings reveal a\npreviously-unrealized limitation: the sheer length of the input alone can hurt\nLLM performance, independent of retrieval quality and without any distraction.\nThey motivate our simple, model-agnostic mitigation strategy that transforms a\nlong-context task into a short-context one by prompting the model to recite the\nretrieved evidence before attempting to solve the problem.

The system decomposes structural analysis\ninto subtasks, each managed by a specialized agent powered by the lightweight\nLlama-3.3 70B Instruct model. The workflow begins with a Problem Analysis\nAgent, which extracts geometry, boundary, and material parameters from the user\ninput. Next, a Geometry Agent incrementally derives node coordinates and\nelement connectivity by applying expert-defined rules. These structured outputs\nare converted into executable OpenSeesPy code by a Translation Agent and\nrefined by a Model Validation Agent through consistency checks. Then, a Load\nAgent applies load conditions into the assembled structural model. Experimental\nevaluations on 20 benchmark problems demonstrate that the system achieves\naccuracy over 80% in most cases across 10 repeated trials, outperforming\nGemini-2.5 Pro and ChatGPT-4o models."}

Particle Filtering (PF) has emerged as a strong\nITS method for complex mathematical reasoning tasks, but it is vulnerable when\nguided by process reward models, which often assign overconfident scores early\nin the reasoning process. This causes PF to suffer from premature exploitation:\nit myopically commits to locally promising trajectories, prunes potentially\ncorrect hypotheses, and converges to suboptimal solutions. This failure mode,\nknown as particle impoverishment, is especially severe under constrained\ncomputational budgets. To address this, we analyze the problem and identify two\nroot causes: a lack of diversity in the particle set due to overconfident\nresampling and consequent inability to assess the potential of a reasoning\npath. We introduce Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF), an algorithm that\nintegrates two new techniques to solve these issues. The first technique,\nEntropic Annealing (EA), directly mitigates particle impoverishment by\nmonitoring search diversity via entropy; when diversity drops, it intervenes by\ndynamically annealing the resampling distribution to preserve exploration. The\nsecond, an enhancement called Look-ahead Modulation (LaM), adds a predictive\nguide to evaluate a state's potential based on its successors. On several\nchallenging math benchmarks, ePF significantly outperforms strong baselines and\nachieves up to a 50 % relative improvement in task reward.

We observe that prevailing strategies either rely on\nstatic rules or aggressively offload activations without fully leveraging the\ninteraction between memory constraints and scheduling efficiency. To address\nthis, we formulate scheduling as a constrained optimization problem that\njointly accounts for memory capacity, activation reuse, and pipeline bubble\nminimization. Solving this model yields fine-grained schedules that reduce\npipeline bubbles while adhering to strict memory budgets. Our approach\ncomplements existing offloading techniques: whereas prior approaches trade\nmemory for time in a fixed pattern, we dynamically optimize the tradeoff with\nrespect to model structure and hardware configuration. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method consistently improves both throughput and memory\nutilization. In particular, we reduce idle pipeline time by up to 50% under the\nsame per-device memory limit, and in some cases, enable the training of larger\nmodels within limited memory budgets."}

However, deploying LLMs at scale\nfor domain specific applications, such as job-person fit and explanation in job\nseeking platforms, introduces distinct challenges. At LinkedIn, the job person\nfit task requires analyzing a candidate's public profile against job\nrequirements to produce both a fit assessment and a detailed explanation.\nDirectly applying open source or finetuned LLMs to this task often fails to\nyield high quality, actionable feedback due to the complexity of the domain and\nthe need for structured outputs. Moreover, the large size of these models leads\nto high inference latency and limits scalability, making them unsuitable for\nonline use. To address these challenges, we introduce LANTERN, a novel LLM\nknowledge distillation framework tailored specifically for job person fit\ntasks. LANTERN involves modeling over multiple objectives, an encoder model for\nclassification purpose, and a decoder model for explanation purpose. To better\ndistill the knowledge from a strong black box teacher model to multiple\ndownstream models, LANTERN incorporates multi level knowledge distillation that\nintegrates both data and logit level insights.

This capability would be particularly beneficial\nin elementary and middle-school mathematics education, where most work remains\nhandwritten, because seeing students' full working of a problem provides\nvaluable insights into their learning processes, but is extremely\ntime-consuming to grade. We present two experiments investigating MLLM\nperformance on handwritten student mathematics classwork. Experiment A examines\n288 handwritten responses from Ghanaian middle school students solving\narithmetic problems with objective answers. In this context, models achieved\nnear-human accuracy (95%, k = 0.90) but exhibited occasional errors that human\neducators would be unlikely to make. Experiment B evaluates 150 mathematical\nillustrations from American elementary students, where the drawings are the\nanswer to the question. These tasks lack single objective answers and require\nsophisticated visual interpretation as well as pedagogical judgment in order to\nanalyze and evaluate them.

First, AHP-CADNet is a\nmulti-level attention fusion framework for automated diagnosis that integrates\nocular landmarks, head pose features, and structured clinical attributes to\ngenerate interpretable predictions. Second, a curriculum learning-based\nimputation framework is designed to mitigate missing data by progressively\nleveraging structured variables and unstructured clinical notes to enhance\ndiagnostic robustness under realistic data conditions. Evaluation on the\nPoseGaze-AHP dataset demonstrates robust diagnostic performance. AHP-CADNet\nachieves 96.9-99.0 percent accuracy across classification tasks and low\nprediction errors for continuous variables, with MAE ranging from 0.103 to\n0.199 and R2 exceeding 0.93. The imputation framework maintains high accuracy\nacross all clinical variables (93.46-99.78 percent with PubMedBERT), with\nclinical dependency modeling yielding significant improvements (p < 0.001).\nThese findings confirm the effectiveness of both frameworks for automated\ndiagnosis and recovery from missing data in clinical settings."}

However,\nwhether HGNNs are intrinsically effective remains underexamined, and most\nstudies implicitly assume rather than establish this effectiveness. In this\nwork, we examine HGNNs from two perspectives: model architecture and\nheterogeneous information. We conduct a systematic reproduction across 21\ndatasets and 20 baselines, complemented by comprehensive hyperparameter\nretuning. To further disentangle the source of performance gains, we develop a\ncausal effect estimation framework that constructs and evaluates candidate\nfactors under standard assumptions through factual and counterfactual analyses,\nwith robustness validated via minimal sufficient adjustment sets, cross-method\nconsistency checks, and sensitivity analyses. Our results lead to two\nconclusions. First, model architecture and complexity have no causal effect on\nperformance. Second, heterogeneous information exerts a positive causal effect\nby increasing homophily and local-global distribution discrepancy, which makes\nnode classes more distinguishable.

An ideal exploration strategy must\nnavigate two fundamental challenges: it must preserve sample quality while also\nensuring training stability. While standard fixed-temperature sampling is\nsimple, it struggles to balance these competing demands, as high temperatures\ndegrade sample quality and low temperatures limit discovery. In this work, we\npropose a simpler and more effective strategy, Exploratory Annealed Decoding\n(EAD), grounded in the insight that exploration is most impactful on early\ntokens which define a sequence's semantic direction. EAD implements an\nintuitive **explore-at-the-beginning, exploit-at-the-end** strategy by\nannealing the sampling temperature from high to low during generation. This\ndynamic schedule encourages meaningful, high-level diversity at the start, then\ngradually lowers the temperature to preserve sample quality and keep the\nsampling distribution close to the target policy, which is essential for stable\ntraining.

This failure mode,\nknown as particle impoverishment, is especially severe under constrained\ncomputational budgets. To address this, we analyze the problem and identify two\nroot causes: a lack of diversity in the particle set due to overconfident\nresampling and consequent inability to assess the potential of a reasoning\npath. We introduce Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF), an algorithm that\nintegrates two new techniques to solve these issues.

To address these issues, we\npropose Oracle-Guided Masked Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (OMC-RL), a\nnovel framework designed to improve the sample efficiency and asymptotic\nperformance of visuomotor policy learning. OMC-RL explicitly decouples the\nlearning process into two stages: an upstream representation learning stage and\na downstream policy learning stage. In the upstream stage, a masked Transformer\nmodule is trained with temporal modeling and contrastive learning to extract\ntemporally-aware and task-relevant representations from sequential visual\ninputs. After training, the learned encoder is frozen and used to extract\nvisual representations from consecutive frames, while the Transformer module is\ndiscarded. In the downstream stage, an oracle teacher policy with privileged\naccess to global state information supervises the agent during early training\nto provide informative guidance and accelerate early policy learning.

A recent work (Garg et al. 2023) considered the classical\ncase, in which one is given (independent) samples from $T$ unknown probability\ndistributions $p_1, \\dots, p_T$ on $[d] = \\{1, 2, \\dots, d\\}$, and one wishes\nto accept/reject the hypothesis that their average $p_{\\mathrm{avg}}$ equals a\nknown hypothesis distribution $q$. Garg et al. showed that if one has just $c =\n2$ samples from each $p_i$, and provided $T \\gg \\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{\\epsilon^2} +\n\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^4}$, one can (whp) distinguish $p_{\\mathrm{avg}} = q$ from\n$d_{\\mathrm{TV}}(p_{\\mathrm{avg}},q) > \\epsilon$. This nearly matches the\noptimal result for the classical iid setting (namely, $T \\gg\n\\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{\\epsilon^2}$). Besides optimally improving this result (and\ngeneralizing to tolerant testing with more stringent distance measures), we\nstudy the analogous problem of hypothesis testing for non-identical quantum\nstates. Here we uncover an unexpected phenomenon: for any $d$-dimensional\nhypothesis state $\\sigma$, and given just a single copy ($c = 1$) of each state\n$\\rho_1, \\dots, \\rho_T$, one can distinguish $\\rho_{\\mathrm{avg}} = \\sigma$\nfrom $D_{\\mathrm{tr}}(\\rho_{\\mathrm{avg}},\\sigma) > \\epsilon$ provided $T \\gg\nd/\\epsilon^2$. (Again, we generalize to tolerant testing with more stringent\ndistance measures.) This matches the optimal result for the iid case, which is\nsurprising because doing this with $c = 1$ is provably impossible in the\nclassical case. We also show that the analogous phenomenon happens for the\nnon-iid extension of identity testing between unknown states. A technical tool\nwe introduce may be of independent interest: an Efron-Stein inequality, and\nmore generally an Efron-Stein decomposition, in the quantum setting."}

Traditional approaches rely on expensive\nhuman-in-the-loop data, which limits scalability. We propose using Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) as policy-agnostic human proxies to generate synthetic\ndata that mimics human decision-making. To evaluate this, we conduct three\nexperiments in a grid-world capture game inspired by Stag Hunt, a game theory\nparadigm that balances risk and reward. In Experiment 1, we compare decisions\nfrom 30 human participants and 2 expert judges with outputs from LLaMA 3.1 and\nMixtral 8x22B models. LLMs, prompted with game-state observations and reward\nstructures, align more closely with experts than participants, demonstrating\nconsistency in applying underlying decision criteria. Experiment 2 modifies\nprompts to induce risk-sensitive strategies (e.g. \"be risk averse\"). LLM\noutputs mirror human participants' variability, shifting between risk-averse\nand risk-seeking behaviours. Finally, Experiment 3 tests LLMs in a dynamic\ngrid-world where the LLM agents generate movement actions. LLMs produce\ntrajectories resembling human participants' paths. While LLMs cannot yet fully\nreplicate human adaptability, their prompt-guided diversity offers a scalable\nfoundation for simulating policy-agnostic teammates."}

However, the\ntrajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations\nin the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally\ndifferent answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient\nmethods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and\nformalize as cross-stratum bias-an \"apples-to-oranges\" comparison of\nheterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment\nand hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address\nthis, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage\nNormalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on\ntheir structural properties and computes advantages locally within each\nstratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true\npeers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields\nconditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains\nthe global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard\nnormalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To\nimprove practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly\nblend SAN with the global estimator.
