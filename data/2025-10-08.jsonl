Here, we address this challenge by\ndeveloping a causal modeling framework that (i) simulates the possible network\npathways that emerge as contagions spread and (ii) identifies which edges and\nnodes are most impactful on diffusion across these possible pathways. This\nyields a surprising discovery. If people require exposure to multiple peers to\nadopt a contagion (a.k.a., 'complex contagions'), the pathways that emerge\noften only work in one direction. In fact, the more complex a contagion is, the\nmore asymmetric its paths become. This emergent directedness problematizes\ncanonical theories of how networks mediate contagion. Weak ties spanning\nnetwork regions - widely thought to facilitate mutual influence and integration\n- prove to privilege the spread contagions from one community to the other.\nEmergent directedness also disproportionately channels complex contagions from\nthe network periphery to the core, inverting standard centrality models. We\ndemonstrate two practical applications. We show that emergent directedness\naccounts for unexplained nonlinearity in the effects of tie strength in a\nrecent study of job diffusion over LinkedIn. Lastly, we show that network\nevolution is biased toward growing directed paths, but that cultural factors\n(e.g., triadic closure) can curtail this bias, with strategic implications for\nnetwork building and behavioral interventions."}

This paper\nintroduces Teamwork: a flexible and efficient unified solution for jointly\nincreasing the number of input and output channels as well as adapting a\npretrained diffusion model to new tasks. Teamwork achieves channel expansion\nwithout altering the pretrained diffusion model architecture by coordinating\nand adapting multiple instances of the base diffusion model (\\ie, teammates).\nWe employ a novel variation of Low Rank-Adaptation (LoRA) to jointly address\nboth adaptation and coordination between the different teammates. Furthermore\nTeamwork supports dynamic (de)activation of teammates. We demonstrate the\nflexibility and efficiency of Teamwork on a variety of generative and inverse\ngraphics tasks such as inpainting, single image SVBRDF estimation, intrinsic\ndecomposition, neural shading, and intrinsic image synthesis."}

Existing frameworks often intertwine inference, memory,\nand control in a single prompt, which can reduce coherence and predictability.\nThe Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) is introduced as an alternative\narchitecture that separates these functions. In SCL, the language model is\ndedicated to inference, memory is maintained externally, and execution is\nguided by a lightweight controller within a goal-directed loop. This design\noffloads cognitive load from the model and allows intermediate results to be\nstored, revisited, and checked before actions are taken, providing a clearer\nbasis for traceability and evaluation.\n  We evaluate SCL against prompt-based baselines including ReAct and common\nLangChain agents across three scenarios: temperature-based travel planning,\nemail drafting with conditional send, and constraint-guided image generation.\nAll systems share the same base model and tools under matched decoding\nsettings. Across 360 episodes, SCL shows modest but consistent improvements.\nTask success averages 86.3 percent compared with 70-77 percent for baselines.\nGoal fidelity is higher, redundant calls are fewer, intermediate states are\nreused more reliably, and unsupported assertions per 100 tool calls are\nreduced. Ablations show that external memory and control each contribute\nindependently, and decoding sweeps confirm stability of the effects.\n  These results suggest that architectural separation can improve reliability\nand traceability without relying on larger models or heavier prompts.

We measure the retardance of a diamond substrate in\ntwo orientations: perpendicular and parallel to the growth direction. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that the correlation between mean retardance\nand thickness differs for these orientations. When measured perpendicular to\nthe growth direction, the mean retardance is approximately proportional to the\nsquare root of the substrate thickness. In contrast, when measured parallel to\nthe growth direction, we observe a generally higher mean retardance and an\napproximately linear correlation with thickness. This anisotropy arises not\nfrom differences in stress magnitude but from differences in the interlayer\ncorrelation of the principal stress axes, as evidenced by correlation\ncoefficients between the azimuth angles of consecutive layers in the diamond\ncrystal. To simulate the integrated retardance of diamond wafers, we propose a\ntwo-dimensional random walk model with momentum drift, which captures the\ndiamond crystal tendency to preserve the azimuth angle across the samples.

Yet, they are almost\nalways executed monolithically, which underutilizes the heterogeneous\naccelerators (NPUs, GPUs, DSPs) in modern SoCs and leads to high end-to-end\nlatency. In this paper, we present NANOMIND, a hardware--software co-design\ninference framework for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that breaks large models\ninto modular ``bricks'' (vision, language, audio, etc.) and maps each to its\nideal accelerator. The key insight is that large models can be broken into\nmodular components and scheduled to run on the most appropriate compute units.\nIt performs module-level dynamic offloading across accelerators on\nunified-memory SoCs. By combining customized hardware design, system-level\nscheduling, and optimized low-bit computation kernels, we demonstrate our\nframework with a compact, battery-powered device capable of running LMMs\nentirely on device. This prototype functions as a self-contained intelligent\nassistant that requires no network connectivity, while achieving higher\nthroughput and superior power efficiency under strict resource constraints.

When performed in\neither a specialized scanning transmission electron microscope or ultrafast\nelectron microscope (UEM), time-resolved and ultrafast EELS can directly image\ncharge carriers, lattice vibrations, and heat dissipation following\nphotoexcitation or applied bias. Yet recent advances in theoretical\ncalculations and electron optics are often required to realize the full\npotential of ultrafast EEL spectrum imaging. In this review, we present a\ncomprehensive overview of the recent progress in the theory and instrumentation\nof time-resolved and ultrafast EELS. We begin with an introduction to the\ntechnique, followed by a physical description of the loss function. We outline\napproaches for calculating and interpreting ground-state and transient EEL\nspectra spanning low-loss plasmons to core-level excitations analogous to X-ray\nabsorption. We then survey the current state of time-resolved and ultrafast\nEELS techniques beyond photon-induced near-field electron microscopy,\nhighlighting abilities to image carrier and thermal dynamics. Finally, we\nexamine future directions enabled by emerging technologies, including electron\nbeam monochromation, in situ and operando cells, laser-free UEM, and high-speed\ndirect electron detectors. These advances position time-resolved and ultrafast\nEELS as a critical tool for uncovering nanoscale dynamic processes in quantum\nmaterials and solar energy conversion devices."}

The framework consists of six layers: perception, semantic annotation,\ninteroperability, transportation, semantic reasoning, and application, suitable\nfor dynamic environments. Sensors collect data in the form of voltage, which is\nthen processed by microprocessors or microcontrollers in the semantic\nannotation and preprocessing layer. Metadata is added to the raw data,\nincluding the purpose, ID number, and application. Two semantic algorithms are\nproposed in the semantic interoperability and ontologies layer: the\ninteroperability semantic algorithm for standardizing file types and the\nsynonym identification algorithm for identifying synonyms. In the\ntransportation layer, raw data and metadata are sent to other IoT devices or\ncloud computing platforms using techniques like WiFi, Zigbee networks,\nBluetooth, and mobile communication networks. A semantic reasoning layer is\nproposed to infer new knowledge from the existing data, using fuzzy logic,\nDempster-Shafer theory, and Bayesian networks. A Graphical User Interface (GUI)\nis proposed in the application layer to help users communicate with and monitor\nIoT sensors, devices, and new knowledge inferred.

Such results raise a crucial question for both capability\nand safety forecasting: how can one accurately predict a model's behavior when\nscaled to a massive number of attempts, given a vastly smaller sampling budget?\nThis question is directly relevant to model providers, who serve hundreds of\nmillions of users daily, and to governmental regulators, who seek to prevent\nharms. To answer this questions, we make three contributions. First, we find\nthat standard methods for fitting these laws suffer from statistical\nshortcomings that hinder predictive accuracy, especially in data-limited\nscenarios. Second, we remedy these shortcomings by introducing a robust\nestimation framework, which uses a beta-binomial distribution to generate more\naccurate predictions from limited data. Third, we propose a dynamic sampling\nstrategy that allocates a greater budget to harder problems. Combined, these\ninnovations enable more reliable prediction of rare risks and capabilities at a\nfraction of the computational cost."}

While recent work demonstrates\nsuccessful applications maintaining high external data ratios, systematic\nunderstanding of how synthetic data proportion affects model behavior across\ndifferent scales remains limited. This paper presents a controlled empirical\nstudy examining model performance, calibration, and output characteristics when\ntrained on varying synthetic-to-external data ratios. Using the Pythia model\nsuite (410M-12B parameters) across five diverse tasks, we evaluate models after\none to three training iterations with synthetic data proportions ranging from\n0-50\\%. Our key findings include: models maintain stable performance with up to\n20\\% synthetic data, but degradation accelerates beyond 30\\%; larger models\n(6.9B-12B) show greater robustness to synthetic data than smaller models\n(410M-1.4B); calibration degradation precedes accuracy loss, providing an early\nwarning signal; and task characteristics matter, with reasoning tasks degrading\nfaster than retrieval tasks under synthetic data training. Importantly, we find\nthat current best practices, such as those employed in STaR and Self-Instruct\nsystems that maintain greater than 80\\% external data, operate well within safe\nregimes identified by our experiments.

We categorize the\nexisting works along several dimensions, including the levels of linguistic\ndescription, the models included, the genres analyzed, the languages analyzed,\nand the approach to prompting. Additionally, the same scheme is used to present\nthe findings made so far and expose the current trends followed by researchers.\nAmong the most-often reported findings is the observation that AI-generated\ntext is more likely to contain a more formal and impersonal style, signaled by\nthe increased presence of nouns, determiners, and adpositions and the lower\nreliance on adjectives and adverbs. AI-generated text is also more likely to\nfeature a lower lexical diversity, a smaller vocabulary size, and repetitive\ntext. Current research, however, remains heavily concentrated on English data\nand mostly on text generated by the GPT model family, highlighting the need for\nbroader cross-linguistic and cross-model investigation. In most cases authors\nalso fail to address the issue of prompt sensitivity, leaving much room for\nfuture studies that employ multiple prompt wordings in the text generation\nphase."}

Infrequent communication strategies (e.g., Local SGD) reduce this\noverhead but, when applied to adaptive optimizers, often suffer a performance\ngap relative to fully synchronous DDP. We trace this gap to a time-scale\nmismatch: the optimizer's fast-moving momentum, tuned for frequent updates,\ndecays too quickly to smooth gradients over long intervals, leading to\nnoise-dominated optimization. To address this, we propose MT-DAO, a family of\noptimizers that employs multiple slow- and fast-moving first momenta or the\ngradient to track update dynamics across different time scales, for which we\nprovide the first convergence guarantees.

An ideal exploration strategy must\nnavigate two fundamental challenges: it must preserve sample quality while also\nensuring training stability. While standard fixed-temperature sampling is\nsimple, it struggles to balance these competing demands, as high temperatures\ndegrade sample quality and low temperatures limit discovery. In this work, we\npropose a simpler and more effective strategy, Exploratory Annealed Decoding\n(EAD), grounded in the insight that exploration is most impactful on early\ntokens which define a sequence's semantic direction. EAD implements an\nintuitive **explore-at-the-beginning, exploit-at-the-end** strategy by\nannealing the sampling temperature from high to low during generation. This\ndynamic schedule encourages meaningful, high-level diversity at the start, then\ngradually lowers the temperature to preserve sample quality and keep the\nsampling distribution close to the target policy, which is essential for stable\ntraining. We demonstrate that EAD is a lightweight, plug-and-play method that\nsignificantly improves sample efficiency, consistently outperforming\nfixed-temperature sampling across various RLVR algorithms and model sizes.

In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which\ninevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to\ndirectly model \"object\" as the visual equivalence of \"word,\" pushing the model\nto learn the global context and semantics among visual elements. We investigate\nour hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach\ncan be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random\npatches. Considerable evidence from qualitative and quantitative evaluations\nreveals a key finding: object-level representation alone helps to learn a\nreal-world distribution, whereas pixel-averaging shortcuts are often learned\nwithout it. Moreover, further evaluations with multimodal LLMs (MLLM) on visual\nquestion answering (VQA, GQA, ScienceQA) tasks demonstrate the strong reasoning\nand contextual understanding gained with this simple objective.

Accordingly, recent\nefforts often focus on evaluating and improving LLMs' retrieval performance: if\nretrieval is perfect, a model should, in principle, perform just as well on a\nlong input as it does on a short one -- or should it? This paper presents\nfindings that the answer to this question may be negative. Our systematic\nexperiments across 5 open- and closed-source LLMs on math, question answering,\nand coding tasks reveal that, even when models can perfectly retrieve all\nrelevant information, their performance still degrades substantially\n(13.9%--85%) as input length increases but remains well within the models'\nclaimed lengths. This failure occurs even when the irrelevant tokens are\nreplaced with minimally distracting whitespace, and, more surprisingly, when\nthey are all masked and the models are forced to attend only to the relevant\ntokens. A similar performance drop is observed when all relevant evidence is\nplaced immediately before the question. Our findings reveal a\npreviously-unrealized limitation: the sheer length of the input alone can hurt\nLLM performance, independent of retrieval quality and without any distraction.\nThey motivate our simple, model-agnostic mitigation strategy that transforms a\nlong-context task into a short-context one by prompting the model to recite the\nretrieved evidence before attempting to solve the problem.

Our analysis reveals that while Muon effectively\nreduces condition numbers, the resulting updates exhibit highly non-uniform\nneuron norms, causing certain neurons to dominate the optimization process.\nNorMuon addresses this imbalance by maintaining second-order momentum\nstatistics for each neuron and applying row-wise normalization after\northogonalization, ensuring balanced parameter utilization while preserving\nMuon's conditioning benefits. To enable practical deployment at scale, we\ndevelop an efficient distributed implementation under the FSDP2 framework that\nstrategically distributes orthogonalization computations across devices.\nExperiments across multiple model scales demonstrate that NorMuon consistently\noutperforms both Adam and Muon, achieving 21.74% better training efficiency\nthan Adam and 11.31% improvement over Muon on 1.1 B pretraining setting, while\nmaintaining a comparable memory footprint to Muon. Our findings suggest that\northogonalization and adaptive learning rates are complementary rather than\ncompeting approaches, opening new avenues for optimizer design in large-scale\ndeep learning."}

Existing hierarchical key frame extraction methods\nimprove the accuracy of video understanding but still face two critical\nchallenges. 1) How can the interference of extensive redundant information in\nlong videos be mitigated? 2) How can a model dynamically adapt to complex\nhierarchical structures while accurately identifying key frames? To address\nthese issues, we propose VideoMiner, which iteratively segments, captions, and\nclusters long videos, forming a hierarchical tree structure. The proposed\nVideoMiner progresses from long videos to events to frames while preserving\ntemporal coherence, effectively addressing the first challenge. To precisely\nlocate key frames, we introduce T-GRPO, a tree-based group relative policy\noptimization in reinforcement learning method that guides the exploration of\nthe VideoMiner. The proposed T-GRPO is specifically designed for tree\nstructures, integrating spatiotemporal information at the event level while\nbeing guided by the question, thus solving the second challenge. We achieve\nsuperior performance in all long-video understanding tasks and uncover several\ninteresting insights. Our proposed T-GRPO surprisingly incentivizes the model\nto spontaneously generate a reasoning chain. Additionally, the designed tree\ngrowth auxin dynamically adjusts the expansion depth, obtaining accuracy and\nefficiency gains.

This paper\npresents a systematic analysis revealing that CoT often degrades performance in\nvideo reasoning, generating verbose but misleading internal monologues, and\nleading to hallucinated visual details and overridden correct intuitions - a\nphenomenon we term \"visual thinking drift\". We explain this drift through a\nBayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual\nevidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models\nto storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning. To counteract this, we\nintroduce Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a novel reinforcement learning\nframework that explicitly rewards the generation of reasoning traces that are\nverifiably grounded in visual evidence.

We introduce LexiCon -- a natural language-based\n(Lexi) constrained (Con) planning benchmark, consisting of a suite of\nenvironments, that can be used to evaluate the planning capabilities of LLMs in\na principled fashion. The core idea behind LexiCon is to take existing planning\nenvironments and impose temporal constraints on the states.

While IPO addresses general\noverfitting, its uniform regularization can be overly conservative. The more\ntargeted approach of $\\beta$-DPO suffers from its own limitations: its\nbatch-level adaptation applies a single, compromised temperature to\nmixed-margin pairs, its linear update rule can produce unstable negative\n$\\beta$ values, and its filtering mechanism discards potentially useful\ntraining signals. In this work, we introduce Margin-Adaptive Direct Preference\nOptimization (MADPO), a method that provides a stable, data-preserving, and\ninstance-level solution. MADPO employs a practical two-step approach: it first\ntrains a reward model to estimate preference margins and then uses these\nmargins to apply a continuous, adaptive weight to the DPO loss for each\nindividual training sample. This re-weighting scheme creates an effective\ntarget margin that is amplified for hard pairs and dampened for easy pairs,\nallowing for granular control over the learning signal. We provide a\ncomprehensive theoretical analysis, proving that MADPO has a well-behaved\noptimization landscape and is robust to reward model estimation errors. We\nvalidate our theory with experiments on a sentiment generation task, where\nMADPO consistently and significantly outperforms strong baselines across\ndatasets of varying quality. It achieves performance gains of up to +33.3\\% on\nHigh Quality data and +10.5\\% on Low Quality data over the next-best method.\nOur results establish MADPO as a more robust and principled approach to\npreference alignment."}

Specifically, our analysis\nis based on a new metric (Mean Average Squared Distance - $MASED$) to quantify\nthe extent of oversmoothing. We derive layer-wise bounds on $MASED$, which\naggregate to yield global upper and lower distance bounds. Based on this\nquantification of oversmoothing, we further analyze the importance of two\ndifferent properties of the model; namely the norms of the generated node\nembeddings, along with the largest and smallest singular values of the weight\nmatrices. Building on the insights drawn from the theoretical analysis, we show\nthat oversmoothing increases as the number of trainable weight matrices and the\nnumber of adjacency matrices increases. We also use the derived layer-wise\nbounds on $MASED$ to form a proposal for decoupling the number of hops (i.e.,\nadjacency depth) from the number of weight matrices. In particular, we\nintroduce G-Reg, a regularization scheme that increases the bounds, and\ndemonstrate through extensive experiments that by doing so node classification\naccuracy increases, achieving robustness at large depths. We further show that\nby reducing oversmoothing in deep networks, we can achieve better results in\nsome tasks than using shallow ones. Specifically, we experiment with a ``cold\nstart\" scenario, i.e., when there is no feature information for the unlabeled\nnodes. Finally, we show empirically the trade-off between receptive field size\n(i.e., number of weight matrices) and performance, using the $MASED$ bounds.\nThis is achieved by distributing adjacency hops across a small number of\ntrainable layers, avoiding the extremes of under- or over-parameterization of\nthe GNN."}

This capability would be particularly beneficial\nin elementary and middle-school mathematics education, where most work remains\nhandwritten, because seeing students' full working of a problem provides\nvaluable insights into their learning processes, but is extremely\ntime-consuming to grade. We present two experiments investigating MLLM\nperformance on handwritten student mathematics classwork. Experiment A examines\n288 handwritten responses from Ghanaian middle school students solving\narithmetic problems with objective answers. In this context, models achieved\nnear-human accuracy (95%, k = 0.90) but exhibited occasional errors that human\neducators would be unlikely to make. Experiment B evaluates 150 mathematical\nillustrations from American elementary students, where the drawings are the\nanswer to the question. These tasks lack single objective answers and require\nsophisticated visual interpretation as well as pedagogical judgment in order to\nanalyze and evaluate them. We attempted to separate MLLMs' visual capabilities\nfrom their pedagogical abilities by first asking them to grade the student\nillustrations directly, and then by augmenting the image with a detailed human\ndescription of the illustration. We found that when the models had to analyze\nthe student illustrations directly, they struggled, achieving only k = 0.20\nwith ground truth scores, but when given human descriptions, their agreement\nlevels improved dramatically to k = 0.47, which was in line with human-to-human\nagreement levels. This gap suggests MLLMs can \"see\" and interpret arithmetic\nwork relatively well, but still struggle to \"see\" student mathematical\nillustrations."}

We introduce Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF), an algorithm that\nintegrates two new techniques to solve these issues.

This grounding\nenables skill discovery to simultaneously involve both imitation of reference\nbehaviors and the discovery of semantically related diverse behaviors. On a\nsimulated SMPL humanoid with 359-D observations and 69-D actions, RGSD learns\nstructured skills including walking, running, punching, and side stepping, and\nalso discovers related novel behaviors. In downstream control tasks, RGSD\noutperforms imitation-based skill acquisition baselines. Our results suggest\nthat lightweight reference-guided grounding offers a practical path to\ndiscovering semantically rich and structured skills in high-DoF systems."}

However, applying extended reasoning to every step\nintroduces substantial redundancy, as sub-problems vary widely in difficulty\nand complexity: a small number of pivotal steps are genuinely challenging and\ndecisive for the final answer, while many others only involve straightforward\nrevisions or simple computations. Therefore, a natural idea is to endow\nreasoning models with the ability to adaptively respond to this variation,\nrather than treating all steps with the same level of elaboration. To this end,\nwe propose MixReasoning, a framework that dynamically adjusts the depth of\nreasoning within a single response. The resulting chain of thought then becomes\na mixture of detailed reasoning on difficult steps and concise inference on\nsimpler ones.

The performance gap stems from the fact that\nautoregressive models impose an artificial ordering on inherently unordered\npoint sets, forcing shape generation to proceed as a sequence of local\npredictions. This sequential bias emphasizes short-range continuity but\nundermines the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, hindering\nits ability to enforce global structural properties such as symmetry,\nconsistent topology, and large-scale geometric regularities. Inspired by the\nlevel-of-detail (LOD) principle in shape modeling, we propose PointNSP, a\ncoarse-to-fine generative framework that preserves global shape structure at\nlow resolutions and progressively refines fine-grained geometry at higher\nscales through a next-scale prediction paradigm. This multi-scale factorization\naligns the autoregressive objective with the permutation-invariant nature of\npoint sets, enabling rich intra-scale interactions while avoiding brittle fixed\norderings. Experiments on ShapeNet show that PointNSP establishes\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) generation quality for the first time within the\nautoregressive paradigm.

However, this constraint also\nrestricts information flow and often results in reduced predictive accuracy.\nConcept Sidechannel Models (CSMs) address this limitation by introducing a\nsidechannel that bypasses the bottleneck and carry additional task-relevant\ninformation. While this improves accuracy, it simultaneously compromises\ninterpretability, as predictions may rely on uninterpretable representations\ntransmitted through sidechannels. Currently, there exists no principled\ntechnique to control this fundamental trade-off. In this paper, we close this\ngap. First, we present a unified probabilistic concept sidechannel meta-model\nthat subsumes existing CSMs as special cases. Building on this framework, we\nintroduce the Sidechannel Independence Score (SIS), a metric that quantifies a\nCSM's reliance on its sidechannel by contrasting predictions made with and\nwithout sidechannel information. We propose SIS regularization, which\nexplicitly penalizes sidechannel reliance to improve interpretability. Finally,\nwe analyze how the expressivity of the predictor and the reliance of the\nsidechannel jointly shape interpretability, revealing inherent trade-offs\nacross different CSM architectures.

This\ndynamic schedule encourages meaningful, high-level diversity at the start, then\ngradually lowers the temperature to preserve sample quality and keep the\nsampling distribution close to the target policy, which is essential for stable\ntraining. We demonstrate that EAD is a lightweight, plug-and-play method that\nsignificantly improves sample efficiency, consistently outperforming\nfixed-temperature sampling across various RLVR algorithms and model sizes. Our\nwork suggests that aligning exploration with the natural dynamics of sequential\ngeneration offers a robust path to improving LLM reasoning."}

In contrast to manufacturing, anomaly detection in retail logistics\nfaces new challenges, particularly in the diversity and variability of object\npose and appearance. Leading anomaly detection methods fall short when applied\nto this new setting. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new benchmark that\novercomes the current limitations of existing datasets. With over 230,000\nimages (and more than 29,000 defective instances), it is 40 times larger than\nMVTec-AD and contains more than 48,000 distinct objects. To validate the\ndifficulty of the problem, we conduct an extensive evaluation of multiple\nstate-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, demonstrating that they do not\nsurpass 56.96% AUROC on our dataset. Further qualitative analysis confirms that\nexisting methods struggle to leverage normal samples under heavy pose and\nappearance variation.

OMC-RL explicitly decouples the\nlearning process into two stages: an upstream representation learning stage and\na downstream policy learning stage. In the upstream stage, a masked Transformer\nmodule is trained with temporal modeling and contrastive learning to extract\ntemporally-aware and task-relevant representations from sequential visual\ninputs. After training, the learned encoder is frozen and used to extract\nvisual representations from consecutive frames, while the Transformer module is\ndiscarded. In the downstream stage, an oracle teacher policy with privileged\naccess to global state information supervises the agent during early training\nto provide informative guidance and accelerate early policy learning. This\nguidance is gradually reduced to allow independent exploration as training\nprogresses. Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world environments\ndemonstrate that OMC-RL achieves superior sample efficiency and asymptotic\npolicy performance, while also improving generalization across diverse and\nperceptually complex scenarios."}

A recent work (Garg et al. 2023) considered the classical\ncase, in which one is given (independent) samples from $T$ unknown probability\ndistributions $p_1, \\dots, p_T$ on $[d] = \\{1, 2, \\dots, d\\}$, and one wishes\nto accept/reject the hypothesis that their average $p_{\\mathrm{avg}}$ equals a\nknown hypothesis distribution $q$. Garg et al. showed that if one has just $c =\n2$ samples from each $p_i$, and provided $T \\gg \\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{\\epsilon^2} +\n\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^4}$, one can (whp) distinguish $p_{\\mathrm{avg}} = q$ from\n$d_{\\mathrm{TV}}(p_{\\mathrm{avg}},q) > \\epsilon$. This nearly matches the\noptimal result for the classical iid setting (namely, $T \\gg\n\\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{\\epsilon^2}$). Besides optimally improving this result (and\ngeneralizing to tolerant testing with more stringent distance measures), we\nstudy the analogous problem of hypothesis testing for non-identical quantum\nstates. Here we uncover an unexpected phenomenon: for any $d$-dimensional\nhypothesis state $\\sigma$, and given just a single copy ($c = 1$) of each state\n$\\rho_1, \\dots, \\rho_T$, one can distinguish $\\rho_{\\mathrm{avg}} = \\sigma$\nfrom $D_{\\mathrm{tr}}(\\rho_{\\mathrm{avg}},\\sigma) > \\epsilon$ provided $T \\gg\nd/\\epsilon^2$. (Again, we generalize to tolerant testing with more stringent\ndistance measures.) This matches the optimal result for the iid case, which is\nsurprising because doing this with $c = 1$ is provably impossible in the\nclassical case. We also show that the analogous phenomenon happens for the\nnon-iid extension of identity testing between unknown states. A technical tool\nwe introduce may be of independent interest: an Efron-Stein inequality, and\nmore generally an Efron-Stein decomposition, in the quantum setting."}

Traditional approaches rely on expensive\nhuman-in-the-loop data, which limits scalability. We propose using Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) as policy-agnostic human proxies to generate synthetic\ndata that mimics human decision-making. To evaluate this, we conduct three\nexperiments in a grid-world capture game inspired by Stag Hunt, a game theory\nparadigm that balances risk and reward. In Experiment 1, we compare decisions\nfrom 30 human participants and 2 expert judges with outputs from LLaMA 3.1 and\nMixtral 8x22B models. LLMs, prompted with game-state observations and reward\nstructures, align more closely with experts than participants, demonstrating\nconsistency in applying underlying decision criteria. Experiment 2 modifies\nprompts to induce risk-sensitive strategies (e.g. \"be risk averse\"). LLM\noutputs mirror human participants' variability, shifting between risk-averse\nand risk-seeking behaviours. Finally, Experiment 3 tests LLMs in a dynamic\ngrid-world where the LLM agents generate movement actions. LLMs produce\ntrajectories resembling human participants' paths. While LLMs cannot yet fully\nreplicate human adaptability, their prompt-guided diversity offers a scalable\nfoundation for simulating policy-agnostic teammates."}

However, the\ntrajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations\nin the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally\ndifferent answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient\nmethods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and\nformalize as cross-stratum bias-an \"apples-to-oranges\" comparison of\nheterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment\nand hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address\nthis, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage\nNormalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on\ntheir structural properties and computes advantages locally within each\nstratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true\npeers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields\nconditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains\nthe global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard\nnormalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To\nimprove practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly\nblend SAN with the global estimator.
