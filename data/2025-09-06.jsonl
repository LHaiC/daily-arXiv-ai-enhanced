However,\ncounter-intuitively, the direction of accumulation may not follow that of the\ndirected couplings. In this work, we demonstrate new mechanisms where this\naccumulation can be systematically reversed without modifying the couplings at\nall, just by adjusting the system size or boundary conditions in a different,\ntransverse direction. Moreover, the reversed skin dynamics can be made very\nrobust by suppressing the amplification in the original non-reversed direction.\nWe motivate our approach through a series of warm-up models, culminating in a\ndesigned non-Hermitian Kagome lattice whereby wavepacket simulations\ndemonstrate how robust reversed skin dynamics can be switched on/off in a\nnon-local transverse manner. Our findings highlight how the non-trivial\nentanglement between the spectral loops of different PBC directions can be\nharnessed as a directional amplification switch, paving the way for new avenues\nof non-Hermitian sensing and lasing."}
