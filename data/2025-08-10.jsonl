By utilizing indirect Lyapunov methods and\nlinearizing system dynamics through Jacobian matrices, the methodology replaces\ntraditional semi-definite programming (SDP) techniques with computationally\nefficient linear programming (LP) conditions. This substitution substantially\nlowers the computational burden, including time and memory usage, particularly\nfor high-dimensional systems. The stability criteria are developed using matrix\ntransformations and leveraging the structural characteristics of the system,\nimproving scalability.

Although LP decoders have been\nproposed for quantum codes, their performance and limitations remain relatively\nunderexplored. In this work, we uncover a key limitation of LP decoding for\nquantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes: certain constant-weight error\npatterns lead to ambiguous fractional solutions that cannot be resolved through\nindependent rounding. To address this issue, we incorporate a post-processing\ntechnique known as ordered statistics decoding (OSD), which significantly\nenhances LP decoding performance in practice. Our results show that LP\ndecoding, when augmented with OSD, can outperform belief propagation with the\nsame post-processing for intermediate code sizes of up to hundreds of qubits.\nThese findings suggest that LP-based decoders, equipped with effective\npost-processing, offer a promising approach for decoding near-term quantum LDPC\ncodes."}

While the Deep Deterministic Policy\nGradient (DDPG) algorithm excels in control tasks, its performance in maze\nnavigation suffers from sparse rewards, inefficient exploration, and\nlong-horizon planning difficulties, often leading to low success rates and\naverage rewards, sometimes even failing to achieve effective navigation. To\naddress these limitations, this paper proposes an efficient Hierarchical DDPG\n(HDDPG) algorithm, which includes high-level and low-level policies. The\nhigh-level policy employs an advanced DDPG framework to generate intermediate\nsubgoals from a long-term perspective and on a higher temporal scale. The\nlow-level policy, also powered by the improved DDPG algorithm, generates\nprimitive actions by observing current states and following the subgoal\nassigned by the high-level policy. The proposed method enhances stability with\noff-policy correction, refining subgoal assignments by relabeling historical\nexperiences. Additionally, adaptive parameter space noise is utilized to\nimprove exploration, and a reshaped intrinsic-extrinsic reward function is\nemployed to boost learning efficiency. Further optimizations, including\ngradient clipping and Xavier initialization, are employed to improve\nrobustness. The proposed algorithm is rigorously evaluated through numerical\nsimulation experiments executed using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and\nGazebo. Regarding the three distinct final targets in autonomous maze\nnavigation tasks, HDDPG significantly overcomes the limitations of standard\nDDPG and its variants, improving the success rate by at least 56.59% and\nboosting the average reward by a minimum of 519.03 compared to baseline\nalgorithms."}

However, for most\nresearchers, access to compute time on quantum hardware is limited. This\nnecessitates the need to build simulators that mimic the execution of quantum\ncircuits on noisy quantum hardware accurately and scalably.\n  In this work, we propose TUSQ - Tracking, Uncomputation, and Sampling for\nNoisy Quantum Simulation. To represent the stochastic noisy channels\naccurately, we average the output of multiple quantum circuits with fixed noisy\ngates sampled from the channels. However, this leads to a substantial increase\nin circuit overhead, which slows down the simulation. To eliminate this\noverhead, TUSQ uses two modules: the Error Characterization Module (ECM), and\nthe Tree-based Execution Module (TEM).\n  The ECM tracks the number of unique circuit executions needed to accurately\nrepresent the noise. That is, if initially we needed $n_{1}$ circuit\nexecutions, ECM reduces that number to $n_{2}$ by eliminating redundancies so\nthat $n_{2} < n_{1}$. This is followed by the TEM, which reuses computation\nacross these $n_{2}$ circuits. This computational reuse is facilitated by\nrepresenting all $n_{2}$ circuits as a tree. We sample the significant leaf\nnodes of this tree and prune the remaining ones. We traverse this tree using\ndepth-first search. We use uncomputation to perform rollback-recovery at\nseveral stages which reduces simulation time. We evaluate TUSQ for a total of\n186 benchmarks and report an average speedup of $52.5\\times$ and $12.53\\times$\nover Qiskit and CUDA-Q, which goes up to $7878.03\\times$ and $439.38\\times$\nrespectively.

In this study, we employ a Vision\nTransformer (ViT)-based autoencoder to investigate, from a functional\nperspective, how familiarity training can induce sensitivity to global context\nin the early layers of a deep neural network. We hypothesize that rapid\nlearning operates via fast weights, which encode transient or short-term memory\ntraces, and we explore the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to implement such\nfast weights within each Transformer layer. Our results show that (1) The\nproposed ViT-based autoencoder's self-attention circuit performs a manifold\ntransform similar to a neural circuit model of the familiarity effect.

We construct a dataset of weight transitions governed by this\ncontrolled forgetting and employ meta-learning to model weight prediction\neffectively. Specifically, our \\textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights Nowcaster\n(KNOWN)} acts as a hyper-model that learns the general evolution of weights and\npredicts enhanced weights with improved generalization. Extensive experiments\nacross diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that KNOW prediction\nconsistently outperforms Na\\\"ive fine-tuning and simple weight prediction,\nleading to superior downstream performance. Our work provides a new perspective\non reinterpreting forgetting dynamics to push the limits of knowledge transfer\nin deep learning."}

To this end, we allow the novice to say: \"I\nplan to do this, but I am uncertain.\" We introduce the Active Skill-level Data\nAggregation (ASkDAgger) framework, which leverages teacher feedback on the\nnovice plan in three key ways: (1) S-Aware Gating (SAG): Adjusts the gating\nthreshold to track sensitivity, specificity, or a minimum success rate; (2)\nForesight Interactive Experience Replay (FIER), which recasts valid and\nrelabeled novice action plans into demonstrations; and (3) Prioritized\nInteractive Experience Replay (PIER), which prioritizes replay based on\nuncertainty, novice success, and demonstration age.

Most existing methods generate reports from single\nimages, neglecting this essential prior information and thus failing to capture\ndiagnostic intent or disease progression. To bridge this gap, we propose\nPriorRG, a novel chest X-ray report generation framework that emulates\nreal-world clinical workflows via a two-stage training pipeline.

It integrates visual feedback-driven behavior analysis\nwithin the policy generation process to identify failure patterns and\nfacilitate targeted improvements, enhancing the efficiency of policy discovery\nand producing adaptable, human-aligned policies. Experimental results show that\nMLES achieves policy discovery capabilities and efficiency comparable to\nProximal Policy Optimization (PPO) across two control tasks, while offering\ntransparent control logic and traceable design processes. This paradigm\novercomes the limitations of predefined domain-specific languages, facilitates\nknowledge transfer and reuse, and is scalable across various control tasks.\nMLES shows promise as a leading approach for the next generation of\ninterpretable control policy discovery."}

Specifically, the framework operates in a\ntwo-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal\nfeatures, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the\npreliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's\ncoarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only\nhas explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of\nthe final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as\nwell as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution\nto the core challenges in image fusion.

In this paper, we\npropose Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS), a novel method that\nmitigates overthinking in LRLMs while maintaining reasoning accuracy. CGRS\noperates by dynamically suppressing the model's generation of reflection\ntriggers when it exhibits high confidence in its current response, thereby\npreventing redundant reflection cycles without compromising output quality. Our\napproach is model-agnostic, requires no retraining or architectural\nmodifications, and can be integrated seamlessly with existing autoregressive\ngeneration pipelines. Extensive experiments across four reasoning benchmarks\n(i.e., AIME24, AMC23, MATH500, and GPQA-D) demonstrate CGRS's effectiveness: it\nreduces token usage by an average of 18.5% to 41.9% while preserving accuracy.\nIt also achieves the optimal balance between length reduction and performance\ncompared to state-of-the-art baselines.

In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a\nframework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design\ntrajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to\ngenerate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We propose\ntwo key innovations: Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to encourage population\ndiversity, and a Statistics Feedback Loop that enables the LLM to analyze and\nimprove alternative predictions. Our evaluations demonstrate that TrajEvo\noutperforms existing heuristic methods across multiple real-world datasets, and\nnotably surpasses both heuristic and deep learning methods in generalizing to\nan unseen OOD real-world dataset.
