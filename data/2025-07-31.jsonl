The goal is to\nfind a minimum-cost sequence of swaps of adjacent tokens to reach the final\nassignment from the initial assignment, where the cost is the sum over all\nswaps of the sum of the weights of the two swapped tokens. Unweighted token\nswapping has been extensively studied: it is NP-hard to approximate to a factor\nbetter than $14/13$, and there is a polynomial-time 4-approximation, along with\na tight \"barrier\" result showing that the class of locally optimal algorithms\ncannot achieve a ratio better than 4. For trees, the problem remains NP-hard to\nsolve exactly, and there is a polynomial-time 2-approximation, along with a\ntight barrier result showing that the class of $\\ell$-straying algorithms\ncannot achieve a ratio better than 2. Weighted token swapping with $\\{0,1\\}$\nweights is much harder to approximation: it is NP-hard to approximate even to a\nfactor of $(1-\\varepsilon) \\cdot \\ln n$ for any constant $\\varepsilon>0$.\nRestricting to positive weights, no approximation algorithms are known, and the\nonly known lower bounds are those inherited directly from the unweighted\nversion. We provide the first approximation algorithms for weighted token\nswapping on both trees and general graphs, along with tight barrier results.\nLetting $w$ and $W$ be the minimum and maximum token weights, our approximation\nratio is $2+2W/w$ for general graphs and $1+W/w$ for trees."}

This richer\nconception of systematicity has been obscured by the long shadow of the\n\"systematicity challenge\" to connectionism, according to which network\narchitectures are fundamentally at odds with what Fodor and colleagues termed\n\"the systematicity of thought.\" I offer a conceptual framework for thinking\nabout \"the systematicity of thought\" that distinguishes four senses of the\nphrase. I use these distinctions to defuse the perceived tension between\nsystematicity and connectionism and show that the conception of systematicity\nthat historically shaped our sense of what makes thought rational,\nauthoritative, and scientific is more demanding than the Fodorian notion. To\ndetermine whether we have reason to hold AI models to this ideal of\nsystematicity, I then argue, we must look to the rationales for systematization\nand explore to what extent they transfer to AI models. I identify five such\nrationales and apply them to AI.

Deep learning (DL)-based segmentation\noffers promising tools for tumour delineation, yet its performance across\nheterogeneous PBT subtypes and MRI protocols remains uncertain. Methods A\nretrospective single-centre cohort of 174 paediatric patients with HGG, LGG,\nmedulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and other rarer subtypes was used. MRI\nsequences included T1, T1 post-contrast (T1-C), T2, and FLAIR.

We find that when interference is allowed between two quantum\nevolutions that individually generate non-Markovianity and yet do not exhibit\ninformation backflow, it becomes possible to retrieve information from the\nenvironment. Furthermore, we show that this setup involving\ncoherently-controlled quantum operation trajectories provides enhanced\nperformance and is more robust compared to an alternate coherently-controlled\narrangement of the quantum switch."}

A heat transfer model for three-layer heterostructures is\ndeveloped by combining First-principles calculations with the Monte Carlo\nmethod. The temperature distribution, spectral heat conductance, and\ninterfacial thermal conductance are compared for Si/Diamond heterostructures\nwith and without a silicon carbide (SiC) interlayer. The results show that the\nSiC interlayer effectively bridges low-frequency phonons in Si with\nmid-to-high-frequency phonons in Diamond, which forms a specific phonon bridge,\nsignificantly improving interfacial phonon transport. The influence of SiC\ninterlayer thickness is further studied, revealing a size-dependent phonon\nbridge enhancement. For thin interlayers, intensified phonon boundary\nscattering weakens the bridging effect. Conversely, excessively thick\ninterlayers increase the bulk thermal resistance, reducing overall interfacial\nthermal conductance. Thus, an optimal interlayer thickness exists, identified\nas 40 nm for SiC. Thirteen candidate interlayer materials, including SiC, AlN,\n{\\alpha}-Si3N4, \\b{eta}-Si3N4, and AlxGa1-xN (x ranges from 0.1 to 0.9), are\ncompared at various thicknesses.

Many experiments have since been done that are\nconsistent with quantum mechanics, disproving the concept of local realism. But\nall these tests suffered from loopholes allowing a local-realistic explanation\nof the experimental observations. In this context, of special interest is\nentanglement between different quantum objects like atoms and photons, because\nit allows one to entangle distant atoms by the interference of photons. The\nresulting space-like separation together with the almost perfect detection\nefficiency of the atoms will allow a first event-ready Bell test closing\ndetection and locality loopholes.\n  The primary goal of the present thesis was the experimental realization of\nentanglement between a single localized atom and a single spontaneously emitted\nphoton. In the experiment a single optically trapped R87 atom is excited to a\nstate which has two selected decay channels. In the following spontaneous decay\na photon is emitted coherently with equal probability into both decay channels.\nThis accounts for perfect correlations between the polarization state of the\nemitted photon and the Zeeman state of the atom after spontaneous decay.\nBecause these decay channels are spectrally and in all other degrees of freedom\nindistinguishable, the spin state of the atom is entangled with the\npolarization state of the photon. To verify entanglement, appropriate\ncorrelation measurements in complementary bases of the photon polarization and\nthe internal quantum state of the atom were performed. It is shown, that the\ngenerated atom-photon state yields an entanglement fidelity of 0.82."}

In our evaluation, we compare various approaches for feeding\nrelevant context from the KG to the LLM and analyze their proficiency in\ntransforming real-world questions into SPARQL queries. Our findings show that\nLLMs can significantly improve their performance on generating correct and\ncomplete queries when provided only the adequate context of the KG schema. Such\ncontext-aware prompting techniques help LLMs to focus on the relevant parts of\nthe ontology and reduce the risk of hallucination. We anticipate that the\nproposed techniques help LLMs to democratize access to complex data\nrepositories and empower informed decision-making in manufacturing settings."}

Second, an\nadaptive loss function dynamically combines Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean\nAbsolute Error (MAE) terms with a piecewise Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)\nregularization, which suppresses noise and outliers in low-SNR regions while\npreserving fine-scale features in high-SNR regions.\n  We validate $\\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ on challenging problems including\nviscoelastic fluid flows, maximum specific humidity fields, sea surface\ntemperature distributions, and rotating turbulent flows. Compared to the\ntraditional $\\textbf{SHRED}$ approach, $\\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ achieves\nsignificantly higher reconstruction fidelity - as demonstrated by improved SSIM\nand PSNR values, lower normalized errors, and enhanced LPIPS scores-thereby\nproviding superior preservation of small-scale structures and increased\nrobustness against noise and outliers.\n  Our results underscore the advantages of the jointly trained CS and SHRED\ndesign architecture which includes an LSTM sequence model for characterizing\nthe temporal evolution with a shallow decoder network (SDN) for modeling the\nhigh-dimensional state space.

In this\nwork, we demonstrate the transfer of unprecedentedly large levels of uniform\nbiaxial compressive strain to single-layer WS$_2$ by employing a pre-straining\napproach prior to cryogenic cooling. Using a hot-dry-transfer method,\nsingle-layer WS$_2$ samples were deposited onto thermally expanded polymeric\nsubstrates at 100 $^\\circ$C. As the substrate cools to room temperature, it\ncontracts, inducing biaxial compressive strain (up to ~0.5%) in the WS$_2$\nlayer. This pre-strain results in a measurable blueshift in excitonic energies\ncompared to samples transferred at room temperature, which serve as control\n(not pre-strained) samples. Subsequent cooling of the pre-strained samples from\nroom temperature down to 5 K leads to a remarkable total blueshift of ~200 meV\nin the exciton energies of single-layer WS$_2$. This energy shift surpasses\npreviously reported values, indicating superior levels of biaxial compressive\nstrain induced by the accumulated substrate contraction of ~1.7%.

As the substrate cools to room temperature, it\ncontracts, inducing biaxial compressive strain (up to ~0.5%) in the WS$_2$\nlayer. This pre-strain results in a measurable blueshift in excitonic energies\ncompared to samples transferred at room temperature, which serve as control\n(not pre-strained) samples. Subsequent cooling of the pre-strained samples from\nroom temperature down to 5 K leads to a remarkable total blueshift of ~200 meV\nin the exciton energies of single-layer WS$_2$.

A data-driven study of 18,000 random $7\\times7$\nmatrices shows that the monotone class obeys $\\lvert c_{0}/c_{1}\\rvert\\le0.18$\nwith probability $>99.98\\%$; because $\\lvert c_{0}/c_{1}\\rvert =\n1/\\mathrm{tr}(A^{-1})$ for monotone $A$, this is equivalent to the simple bound\n$\\mathrm{tr}(A^{-1})\\ge5.7$."}

To be specific, HOLA features\nan iterative-aware cross-modal learning module for selective audio-visual\ninteractions, hierarchical contextual modeling with gated aggregations under\nthe local-global perspective, and a pyramid-like refiner for scale-aware\ncross-grained semantic enhancements. Moreover, we propose the pseudo supervised\nsingal injection strategy to further boost model performance. Extensive\nexperiments across expert models and MLLMs impressivly demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed HOLA. We also conduct a series of ablation\nstudies to explore the crucial design factors of our introduced components.\nRemarkably, our HOLA ranks 1st, outperforming the second by 0.0476 AUC on the\nTestA set."}

By combining a high-performance neural network with explainable AI\n(XAI) techniques, we can distill a model's learned strategy into\nhuman-interpretable rules. We apply this approach to the challenging case of\nmonotone matrices, defined by the condition that their inverses are entrywise\nnonnegative.

Here, we\npresent, to the best of our knowledge, the first systematic machine-learning\napproach for deriving a practical criterion that distinguishes monotone from\nnon-monotone matrices. After establishing a labelled dataset by randomly\ngenerated monotone and non-monotone matrices uniformly on $(-1,1)$, we employ\ndeep neural network algorithms for classifying the matrices as monotone or\nnon-monotone, using both their entries and a comprehensive set of matrix\nfeatures.

We train MoCHA on two\nmainstream LLMs (e.g., Phi2-2.7B and Vicuna-7B) and evaluate their performance\nacross various benchmarks. Notably, MoCHA outperforms state-of-the-art\nopen-weight models on various tasks. For example, compared to CuMo\n(Mistral-7B), our MoCHA (Phi2-2.7B) presents outstanding abilities to mitigate\nhallucination by showing improvements of 3.25% in POPE and to follow visual\ninstructions by raising 153 points on MME. Finally, ablation studies further\nconfirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed MoECs and HGA in\nimproving the overall performance of MoCHA."}

In this paper, we propose an\nAI-based low-complexity scaler (LCS) inspired by state-of-the-art efficient\nsuper-resolution (ESR) models which could offload the workload on the GPU to a\nlow-power device such as a neural processing unit (NPU). The LCS is trained on\nGameIR image pairs natively rendered at low and high resolution. We utilize\nadversarial training to encourage reconstruction of perceptually important\ndetails, and apply reparameterization and quantization techniques to reduce\nmodel complexity and size. In our comparative analysis we evaluate the LCS\nalongside the publicly available AMD hardware-based Edge Adaptive Scaling\nFunction (EASF) and AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 1 (FSR1) on five different\nmetrics, and find that the LCS achieves better perceptual quality,\ndemonstrating the potential of ESR models for upscaling on resource-constrained\ndevices."}

Existing approaches to\nreconstructing images from these intermediate features often result in blurry,\nsemantically ambiguous images. To directly address semantic leakage, we propose\nCapRecover, a cross-modality inversion framework that recovers high-level\nsemantic content, such as labels or captions, directly from intermediate\nfeatures without image reconstruction.\n  We evaluate CapRecover on multiple datasets and victim models, demonstrating\nstrong performance in semantic recovery. Specifically, CapRecover achieves up\nto 92.71% Top-1 label accuracy on CIFAR-10 and generates fluent captions from\nResNet50 features on COCO2017 with ROUGE-L scores up to 0.52. Our analysis\nfurther reveals that deeper convolutional layers encode significantly more\nsemantic information compared to shallow layers. To mitigate semantic leakage,\nwe introduce a simple yet effective protection method: adding random noise to\nintermediate features at each layer and removing the noise in the next layer.\nExperimental results show that this approach prevents semantic leakage without\nadditional training costs."}

However, dominant training paradigms face a critical\nlimitation: reinforcement learning (RL) methods that optimize solely for final\ntask success often reinforce flawed or inefficient reasoning paths, a problem\nwe term inefficient exploration. This leads to agents that are brittle and fail\nto generalize, as they learn to find solutions without learning how to reason\ncoherently. To address this, we introduce RLVMR, a novel framework that\nintegrates dense, process-level supervision into end-to-end RL by rewarding\nverifiable, meta-reasoning behaviors. RLVMR equips an agent to explicitly tag\nits cognitive steps, such as planning, exploration, and reflection, and\nprovides programmatic, rule-based rewards for actions that contribute to\neffective problem-solving. These process-centric rewards are combined with the\nfinal outcome signal and optimized using a critic-free policy gradient method.\nOn the challenging ALFWorld and ScienceWorld benchmarks, RLVMR achieves new\nstate-of-the-art results, with our 7B model reaching an 83.6% success rate on\nthe most difficult unseen task split. Our analysis confirms these gains stem\nfrom improved reasoning quality, including significant reductions in redundant\nactions and enhanced error recovery, leading to more robust, efficient, and\ninterpretable agents."}

Our algorithms are based on a hybrid exploration-generative\nreinforcement learning (RL) model wherein the agent can, from time to time,\nfreely interact with the environment in a generative sampling fashion, i.e., by\nhaving access to a \"simulator\". By employing known classical and new quantum\nalgorithms for approximating optimal policies under a generative model within\nour learning algorithms, we show that it is possible to avoid several paradigms\nfrom RL like \"optimism in the face of uncertainty\" and \"posterior sampling\" and\ninstead compute and use optimal policies directly, which yields better regret\nbounds compared to previous works. For finite-horizon MDPs, our quantum\nalgorithms obtain regret bounds which only depend logarithmically on the number\nof time steps $T$, thus breaking the $O(\\sqrt{T})$ classical barrier. This\nmatches the time dependence of the prior quantum works of Ganguly et al.\n(arXiv'23) and Zhong et al.

For\ninfinite-horizon MDPs, our classical and quantum bounds still maintain the\n$O(\\sqrt{T})$ dependence but with better $S$ and $A$ factors.

However, it has been found that ICL's\nperformance can be sensitive to the choices of demos and their order. This\npaper investigates an unexplored new positional bias of ICL for the first time:\nwe observe that the predictions and accuracy can drift drastically when the\npositions of demos, the system prompt, and the user message in LLM input are\nvaried. We refer to this bias as DEMOS' POSITION IN PROMPT (DPP) bias. We\ndesign a systematic evaluation pipeline to study this type of positional bias\nacross classification, question answering, summarization, and reasoning tasks.\nWe introduce two metrics, ACCURACY-CHANGE and PREDICTION-CHANGE, to quantify\nnet gains and output volatility induced by changes in the demos' position.\nExtensive experiments on ten LLMs from four open-source model families (QWEN,\nLLAMA3, MISTRAL, COHERE) verify that the bias significantly affects their\naccuracy and predictions: placing demos at the start of the prompt yields the\nmost stable and accurate outputs with gains of up to +6 points. In contrast,\nplacing demos at the end of the user message flips over 30\\% of predictions\nwithout improving correctness on QA tasks. Smaller models are most affected by\nthis sensitivity, though even large models remain marginally affected on\ncomplex tasks."}
