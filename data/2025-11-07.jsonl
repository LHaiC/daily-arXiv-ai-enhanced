Addressing this critical\ngap, this paper conducts research to propose a novel automated theorem\ngeneration theory and tool. Based on the concept of standard contradiction\nwhich possesses unique deductive advantages, this paper defines and proves, for\nthe first time, a new logical structure known as rectangular standard\ncontradiction. Centered on this structure, a complete Automated Theorem\nGeneration (ATG) theory is put forward. Theoretical proofs clarify two core\nproperties of rectangular standard contradiction: first, it is a standard\ncontradiction (necessarily unsatisfiable); second, it exhibits non-redundancy\n(the remaining clause set becomes satisfiable after removing any clause).\nLeveraging these properties, this paper proves that partitioning a rectangular\nstandard contradiction into a premise subset $A$ and negation of its complement\n$H$, a valid theorem $A \\vdash \\neg H$ can be formed, and all such theorems are\nlogically equivalent. To implement this theory, an efficient template-based ATG\nalgorithm is designed, and a Rectangular Automated Theorem Generator is\ndeveloped. This research enables machines to transition from \"verifiers\" to\n\"discoverers\", opening up new avenues for fundamental research in the fields of\nlogic and artificial intelligence."}

Foligno et al. [Phys. Rev. X 13, 041008 (2023)] recently\nargued that the TE in chaotic 1d quantum circuits obeys linear (volume-law)\nscaling with evolution time. To reconcile this apparent high complexity of IM\nwith the rapid thermalization of local observables, here we study the relation\nbetween TE, non-Markovianity, and local temporal correlations for chaotic\nquantum baths. By exactly solving a random-unitary bath model, and bounding\ndistillable entanglement between future and past degrees of freedom, we argue\nthat TE is extensive for low enough bath growth rate, and it reflects genuine\nnon-Markovianity. This memory, however, is entirely contained in highly complex\ntemporal correlations, and its effect on few-point temporal correlators is\nnegligible. An IM coarse-graining procedure, reducing the allowed frequency of\nmeasurements of the probe system, results in a transition from volume- to\narea-law TE scaling. We demonstrate the generality of this TE transition in 1d\ncircuits by analyzing the kicked Ising model analytically at dual-unitary\npoints, as well as numerically away from them.

Despite its significance, tokenization in the\ncontext of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to\naddress this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary\nsize. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules\ntailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we\nassess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a\ncritical problem in binary code analysis.\n  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,\nsystematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and\ncapturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare\ntokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and\nrepresentational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained\nmodels such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the\nencoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate\nthe effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.\nPreliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences\ndownstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete\npredictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex\ntrade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in\npractical assembly code tasks. Ultimately, this study provides valuable\ninsights into optimizing tokenization models for low-level code analysis,\ncontributing to the robustness and scalability of Natural Language Model\n(NLM)-based binary analysis workflows."}

Recent observations suggest that the internal\nactivations of LLMs are often dynamically sparse, meaning that for each input,\nonly part of the network contributes significantly to the output. Such sparsity\ncould reduce computation, but it interacts poorly with group-wise quantization,\nwhich remains the dominant approach for fitting LLMs onto resource-constrained\nhardware. To reconcile these two properties, this study proposes a set of\ntechniques that realize dynamic sparse inference under low-bit quantization.\nThe method features: (1) a zigzag-patterned quantization layout that organizes\nweights in a way consistent with activation sparsity and improves GPU memory\nlocality; (2) a specialized GEMV kernel designed for this layout to fully\nutilize parallel compute units; and (3) a compact runtime mechanism that\ngathers sparse indices with minimal overhead.

As a result, the field lacks\nrobust tools for assessing the realism of LLM-generated text or for calibrating\nmodels to real-world data. This paper makes two contributions. First, we\nintroduce a computational Turing test: a validation framework that integrates\naggregate metrics (BERT-based detectability and semantic similarity) with\ninterpretable linguistic features (stylistic markers and topical patterns) to\nassess how closely LLMs approximate human language within a given dataset.\nSecond, we systematically compare nine open-weight LLMs across five calibration\nstrategies -- including fine-tuning, stylistic prompting, and context retrieval\n-- benchmarking their ability to reproduce user interactions on X (formerly\nTwitter), Bluesky, and Reddit. Our findings challenge core assumptions in the\nliterature. Even after calibration, LLM outputs remain clearly distinguishable\nfrom human text, particularly in affective tone and emotional expression.\nInstruction-tuned models underperform their base counterparts, and scaling up\nmodel size does not enhance human-likeness.

As biological brains likely lack slots, we consider how they\nmight achieve similar functional outcomes without them by building on the\nneurally-inspired modern Hopfield network (MHN; Krotov & Hopfield, 2021), which\nstores patterns in the connection weights of an individual neuron. We propose\nextensions of this approach to increase its biological plausibility as a model\nof memory and to capture an important advantage of slot-based computation in\ncontemporary language models. For memory, neuroscience research suggests that\nthe weights of overlapping sparse ensembles of neurons, rather than a dedicated\nindividual neuron, are used to store a memory. We introduce the K-winner MHN,\nextending the approach to ensembles, and find that within a continual learning\nregime, the ensemble-based MHN exhibits greater retention of older memories, as\nmeasured by the graded sensitivity measure d', than a standard (one-neuron)\nMHN. Next, we consider the powerful use of slot-based memory in contemporary\nlanguage models. These models use slots to store long sequences of past inputs\nand their learned encodings, supporting later predictions and allowing error\nsignals to be transported backward in time to adjust weights underlying the\nlearned encodings of these past inputs.

Accepted to NeurIPS Datasets & Benchmarks 2025", "summary": "Multimodal language models possess a remarkable ability to handle an\nopen-vocabulary's worth of objects. Yet the best models still suffer from\nhallucinations when reasoning about scenes in the real world, revealing a gap\nbetween their seemingly strong performance on existing perception benchmarks\nthat are saturating and their reasoning in the real world. To address this gap,\nwe build a novel benchmark of in-the-wild scenes that we call Common-O. With\nmore than 10.5k examples using exclusively new images not found in web training\ndata to avoid contamination, Common-O goes beyond just perception, inspired by\ncognitive tests for humans, to probe reasoning across scenes by asking \"what's\nin common?\". We evaluate leading multimodal language models, including models\nspecifically trained to perform chain-of-thought reasoning. We find that\nperceiving objects in single images is tractable for most models, yet reasoning\nacross scenes is very challenging even for the best models, including reasoning\nmodels. Despite saturating many leaderboards focusing on perception, the best\nperforming model only achieves 35% on Common-O -- and on Common-O Complex,\nconsisting of more complex scenes, the best model achieves only 1%. Curiously,\nwe find models are more prone to hallucinate when similar objects are present\nin the scene, suggesting models may be relying on object co-occurrence seen\nduring training. Among the models we evaluated, we found scale can provide\nmodest improvements while models explicitly trained with multi-image inputs\nshow bigger improvements, suggesting scaled multi-image training may offer\npromise. We make our benchmark publicly available to spur research into the\nchallenge of hallucination when reasoning across scenes."}

While Fisher market equilibria have been well-studied, the\ntheoretical foundations for Lindahl equilibria remain substantially\nunderdeveloped.\n  In this work, we propose a unified duality framework for market equilibria.\nWe show that Lindahl equilibria of a public goods market correspond to Fisher\nmarket equilibria in a dual Fisher market with dual utilities, and vice versa.\nThe dual utility is based on the indirect utility, and the correspondence\nbetween the two equilibria works by exchanging the roles of allocations and\nprices.\n  Using the duality framework, we address the gaps concerning the computation\nand dynamics for Lindahl equilibria and obtain new insights and developments\nfor Fisher market equilibria. First, we leverage this duality to analyze\nwelfare properties of Lindahl equilibria. For concave homogeneous utilities, we\nprove that a Lindahl equilibrium maximizes Nash Social Welfare (NSW). For\nconcave non-homogeneous utilities, we show that a Lindahl equilibrium achieves\n$(1/e)^{1/e}$ approximation to the optimal NSW, and the approximation ratio is\ntight. Second, we apply the duality framework to market dynamics, including\nproportional response dynamics (PRD) and t\\^atonnement. We obtain new market\ndynamics for the Lindahl equilibria from market dynamics in the dual Fisher\nmarket. We also use duality to extend PRD to markets with total complements\nutilities, the dual class of gross substitutes utilities. Finally, we apply the\nduality framework to markets with chores. We propose a program for private\nchores for general convex homogeneous disutilities that avoids the \"poles\"\nissue, whose KKT points correspond to Fisher market equilibria.

By pruning exercise\nrelation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and training DKT on causal\nsubsets of the Assistments dataset, we show that DKT's predictive capabilities\nalign strongly with these causal structures. Furthermore, we propose an\nalternative method for extracting exercise relation DAGs using DKT's learned\nrepresentations and provide empirical evidence supporting our claim. Our\nfindings suggest that DKT's effectiveness is largely driven by its capacity to\napproximate causal dependencies between KCs rather than simple relational\nmappings."}

The goal is to ensure that beyond some finite\ntime, one of the guesses is correct at each time step.\n  We give an exact characterization of collections of languages that can be\n$k$-list identified in the limit, based on a recursive version of Angluin's\ncharacterization (for language identification with a list of size $1$). This\nfurther leads to a conceptually appealing characterization: A language\ncollection can be $k$-list identified in the limit if and only if the\ncollection can be decomposed into $k$ collections of languages, each of which\ncan be identified in the limit (with a list of size $1$). We also use our\ncharacterization to establish rates for list identification in the statistical\nsetting where the input is drawn as an i.i.d. stream from a distribution\nsupported on some language in the collection. Our results show that if a\ncollection is $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then the collection can be\n$k$-list identified at an exponential rate, and this is best possible. On the\nother hand, if a collection is not $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then it\ncannot be $k$-list identified at any rate that goes to zero."}

WELL: Dynamic Reasoning and Learning with Symbolic World Model for Embodied LLM-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration", "comment": null, "summary": "Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with\npartial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory\nlevel often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into\nconflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of\nabstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable\nsynchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized\nneurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation\nunfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose\ncandidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under\nconsensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent\nindependently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without\nrevealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a\nshared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.\nBy reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids\nbrittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are\nreusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative\nblock-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world\nmodel capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and\nefficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic\nworld model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and\nself-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient\ncollaboration strategies."}

As\na result, these states may not provide informative learning signals, causing\nhigh variance into the update process. This issue is exacerbated when the\nsampled transitions are poorly aligned with the agent's current policy. To\naddress this limitation, we propose the Successor-state Aggregation Deep\nQ-Network (SADQ), which explicitly models environment dynamics using a\nstochastic transition model. SADQ integrates successor-state distributions into\nthe Q-value estimation process, enabling more stable and policy-aligned value\nupdates. Additionally, it explores a more efficient action selection strategy\nwith the modeled transition structure. We provide theoretical guarantees that\nSADQ maintains unbiased value estimates while reducing training variance. Our\nextensive empirical results across standard RL benchmarks and real-world\nvector-based control tasks demonstrate that SADQ consistently outperforms DQN\nvariants in both stability and learning efficiency."}

The Rule-Based Control (RBC), which serves as a lower benchmark, is a\nscheduler designed to require minimal inputs for operation. The Model\nPredictive Control (MPC) is intended as a cost-optimal benchmark with an ideal\nforecast. The results show that ComEMS4Build, similar to MPC, does not violate\nthe thermal comfort of occupants in 10 out of 12 weeks, while RBC has a\nslightly higher median discomfort of 0.68 Kh. The ComEMS4Build increases the\nweekly electricity costs by 12.06 EUR compared to MPC, while RBC increases the\nweekly costs by 30.14 EUR. The ComEMS4Build improves the Hybrid Energy Storage\nSystem (HESS) utilization and energy exchange with the main grid compared to\nthe RBC. However, when it comes to the FC operation, the RBC has an advantage,\nas it reduces the toggling counts by 3.48% and working hours by 7.59% compared\nto MPC..."}

To address this, we introduce Iterative\nRegret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (Iterative RMFT), a post-training procedure\nthat repeatedly distills low-regret decision trajectories back into the base\nmodel. At each iteration, the model rolls out multiple decision trajectories,\nselects the k-lowest regret ones, and fine-tunes itself on them.

However, some RLVR algorithms, such as GRPO (Group Relative\nPolicy Optimization) and GSPO (Group Sequence Policy Optimization), are\nobserved to suffer from unstable policy updates and low usage of sampling data,\nrespectively. The importance ratio of GRPO is calculated at the token level,\nwhich focuses more on optimizing a single token. This will be easily affected\nby outliers, leading to model training collapse. GSPO proposed the calculation\nof the response level importance ratio, which solves the problem of high\nvariance and training noise accumulation in the calculation of the GRPO\nimportance ratio. However, since all the response tokens share a common\nimportance ratio, extreme values can easily raise or lower the overall mean,\nleading to the entire response being mistakenly discarded, resulting in a\ndecrease in the utilization of sampled data. This paper introduces SSPO, which\napplies sentence-level importance ratio, taking the balance between GRPO and\nGSPO. SSPO not only avoids training collapse and high variance, but also\nprevents the whole response tokens from being abandoned by the clipping\nmechanism. Furthermore, we apply sentence entropy to PPO-CLIP to steadily\nadjust the clipping bounds, encouraging high-entropy tokens to explore and\nnarrow the clipping range of low-entropy tokens. In particular, SSPO achieves\nan average score of 46.57 across five datasets, surpassing GRPO (43.01) and\nGSPO (44.42), and wins state-of-the-art performance on three datasets.

As critical system software and\ninfrastructure, compilers are responsible for transforming source code into\ntarget code.

This paper explores the feasibility of LLM as a Compiler (LaaC) and\nits future directions. We designed the CompilerEval dataset and framework\nspecifically to evaluate the capabilities of mainstream LLMs in source code\ncomprehension and assembly code generation. In the evaluation, we analyzed\nvarious errors, explored multiple methods to improve LLM-generated code, and\nevaluated cross-platform compilation capabilities. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that LLMs exhibit basic capabilities as compilers but currently\nachieve low compilation success rates. By optimizing prompts, scaling up the\nmodel, and incorporating reasoning methods, the quality of assembly code\ngenerated by LLMs can be significantly enhanced. Based on these findings, we\nmaintain an optimistic outlook for LaaC and propose practical architectural\ndesigns and future research directions.

In this study,\nwe look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and\ncultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human\nvalues in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede\nValues Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and\nformulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural\nperspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural\nperspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:\nWhile targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the\ndirection of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not\novercome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a\nrestricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,\nand Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably\nsimilar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with\nselective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment\nwith cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit\ncultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language. Unexpectedly,\ncombining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing with an\nEnglish prompt. These findings reveal that LLMs occupy an uncomfortable middle\nground: They are responsive enough to changes in prompts to produce variation,\nbut too firmly anchored to specific cultural defaults to adequately represent\ncultural diversity."}

Specifically, a Reversible\nColumnar Detection Network (RCDN) is integrated into the detection module to\nleverage multi-level visual features for robust object detection. Furthermore,\na lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor (Li-TAE) is designed to\ncapture global contextual information and generate robust appearance features.\nAnother branch decouples platform-induced and target-intrinsic motion by\nconstructing a projective transformation, applying platform-motion compensation\nwithin the Kalman filter, and thereby stabilizing true object trajectories.\nFinally, a clustering-optimized feature fusion module effectively combines\nmotion and appearance cues to ensure identity consistency under noise,\nocclusion, and drift.

However, deploying\nLLMs as trusted communication intermediaries raises critical questions about\ninformation fidelity, consistency, and reliability. This position paper\nsystematically evaluates the trustworthiness requirements for LAAC's deployment\nacross multiple communication domains. We investigate three fundamental\ndimensions: (1) Information Capture Fidelity - accuracy of intent extraction\nduring sender interviews across different communication types, (2)\nReproducibility - consistency of structured knowledge across multiple\ninteraction instances, and (3) Query Response Integrity - reliability of\nrecipient-facing responses without hallucination, source conflation, or\nfabrication. Through controlled experiments spanning multiple LAAC use cases,\nwe assess these trust dimensions using LAAC's multi-agent architecture.\nPreliminary findings reveal measurable trust gaps that must be addressed before\nLAAC can be reliably deployed in high-stakes communication scenarios."}

Despite these low-level differences,\nhuman demonstrations provide valuable motion cues about how to manipulate and\ninteract with objects.

During decoding, graph-retrieved\nlogits are max-normalized and adaptively fused with model logits to favor\nhigh-evidence continuations while preserving fluency. Across three models and a\nrange of question-answering benchmarks spanning intrinsic, extrinsic\nhallucination, and factuality tasks, GRAD consistently surpasses baselines,\nachieving up to 9.7$\\%$ higher intrinsic accuracy, 8.6$\\%$ lower hallucination\nrates, and 6.9$\\%$ greater correctness compared to greedy decoding, while\nattaining the highest truth--informativeness product score among all methods.\nGRAD offers a lightweight, plug-and-play alternative to contrastive decoding\nand knowledge graph augmentation, demonstrating that statistical evidence from\ncorpus-level token transitions can effectively steer generation toward more\ntruthful and verifiable outputs."}

We\nempirically validate CoRPO on a code verification task, where it demonstrates\nmore stable convergence and better out-of-domain generalization.\n  This work represents a critical step in our broader research program to\nenable LLMs to learn genuinely new capabilities through reinforcement learning.\nWe achieve this by enabling LLMs to learn from rich, multi-dimensional feedback\n- progressing from binary to ordinal rewards in this work, and onward to\ndenser, per-step supervision."}

However, humans and robots differ\nfundamentally in embodiment, resulting in mismatched action execution. Direct\nkinematic retargeting of human hand motion can therefore produce actions that\nare physically infeasible for robots. Despite these low-level differences,\nhuman demonstrations provide valuable motion cues about how to manipulate and\ninteract with objects. Our key idea is to exploit the forward diffusion\nprocess: as noise is added to actions, low-level execution differences fade\nwhile high-level task guidance is preserved. We present X-Diffusion, a\nprincipled framework for training diffusion policies that maximally leverages\nhuman data without learning dynamically infeasible motions. X-Diffusion first\ntrains a classifier to predict whether a noisy action is executed by a human or\nrobot. Then, a human action is incorporated into policy training only after\nadding sufficient noise such that the classifier cannot discern its embodiment.\nActions consistent with robot execution supervise fine-grained denoising at low\nnoise levels, while mismatched human actions provide only coarse guidance at\nhigher noise levels. Our experiments show that naive co-training under\nexecution mismatches degrades policy performance, while X-Diffusion\nconsistently improves it. Across five manipulation tasks, X-Diffusion achieves\na 16% higher average success rate than the best baseline. The project website\nis available at https://portal-cornell.github.io/X-Diffusion/."}

Traditional linear control techniques\noften fail in these contexts, necessitating innovative approaches. This paper\nintroduces a novel approach to approximate the Koopman operator using an\nLSTM-enhanced Deep Koopman model, enabling linear representations of nonlinear\nsystems with time delays. By incorporating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\nlayers, the proposed framework captures historical dependencies and efficiently\nencodes time-delayed system dynamics into a latent space. Unlike traditional\nextended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (eDMD) approaches that rely on predefined\ndictionaries, the LSTM-enhanced Deep Koopman model is dictionary-free, which\nmitigates the problems with the underlying dynamics being known and\nincorporated into the dictionary. Quantitative comparisons with extended eDMD\non a simulated system demonstrate highly significant performance gains in\nprediction accuracy in cases where the true nonlinear dynamics are unknown and\nachieve comparable results to eDMD with known dynamics of a system."}

Experimental\nmeasurements (time histories) of wave elevation at the longitudinal center of\ngravity, heave, pitch, notional flight-deck velocity, notional bridge\nacceleration, and total resistance were collected from irregular wave basin\ntests on a 1:33.3 scale replica of the Delft 372 model under sea state 5\nconditions at Fr = 0.425, and organized into training, validation, and test\nsets. The HDMDc algorithm constructs an equation-free linear reduced-order\nmodel of the seakeeping vessel by augmenting states and inputs with their\ntime-lagged copies to capture nonlinear and memory effects. Two ensembling\nstrategies, namely Bayesian HDMDc (BHDMDc), which samples hyperparameters\nconsidered stochastic variables with prior distribution to produce posterior\nmean forecasts with confidence intervals, and Frequentist HDMDc (FHDMDc), which\naggregates multiple model obtained over data subsets, are compared in providing\nseakeeping prediction and uncertainty quantification.

The core idea is to dynamically select an algorithm for each round,\nchoosing between two candidates: (1) an empirically optimal algorithm derived\nfrom the history of observations, and (2) a sample-based algorithm with a\nproven competitive ratio guarantee. Based on this approach, we design an\nalgorithm that performs no worse than the baseline sample-based algorithm in\nevery round, while ensuring that the total regret is bounded by\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$.\n  We demonstrate the broad applicability of our framework to canonical\nproblems, including the prophet inequality, the secretary problem, and their\nvariants under adversarial, random, and i.i.d. input models. For example, for\nthe repeated prophet inequality problem, our method achieves a\n$1/2$-competitive ratio from the second round on and an $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$\nregret.

WELL: Dynamic Reasoning and Learning with Symbolic World Model for Embodied LLM-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration", "comment": null, "summary": "Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with\npartial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory\nlevel often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into\nconflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of\nabstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable\nsynchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized\nneurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation\nunfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose\ncandidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under\nconsensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent\nindependently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without\nrevealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a\nshared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.\nBy reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR.
