In this problem, we seek a mechanism that (probabilistically) identifies the winner of a tournament after observing round-robin play among $n$ teams in a league. Such a mechanism should satisfy the natural properties of monotonicity and Condorcet consistency. Moreover, from the league's perspective, the winner-determination tournament rule should be strategyproof, meaning that no team can do better by losing a game on purpose.\n  Past work considered settings in which each team is fully selfish, caring only about its own probability of winning, and settings in which each team is fully selfless, caring only about the total winning probability of itself and the team to which it deliberately loses. More recently, researchers considered a mixture of these two settings with a parameter $λ$. Intermediate selfishness $λ$ means that a team will not lose on purpose unless its pair gains at least $λs$ winning probability, where $s$ is the individual team's sacrifice from its own winning probability. All of the dozens of previously known tournament rules require $λ= Ω(n)$ to be strategyproof, and it has been an open problem to find such a rule with the smallest $λ$.\n  In this work, we make significant progress by designing a tournament rule that is strategyproof with $λ= 11$. Along the way, we propose a new notion of multiplicative pairwise non-manipulability that ensures that two teams cannot manipulate the outcome of a game to increase the sum of their winning probabilities by more than a multiplicative factor $δ$ and provide a rule which is multiplicatively pairwise non-manipulable for $δ= 3.5$."}

Prior work shows strong impossibility results, e.g. that even under natural assumptions, no aggregation of the experts' individual forecasts can outperform simply following a random expert (Neyman and Roughgarden, 2022).\n  In this paper, we introduce a more general framework that allows the principal to elicit richer information from experts through structured queries. Our framework ensures that experts will truthfully report their underlying beliefs, and also enables us to define notions of complexity over the difficulty of asking these queries. Under a general model of independent but overlapping expert signals, we show that optimal aggregation is achievable in the worst case with each complexity measure bounded above by the number of agents $n$. We further establish tight tradeoffs between accuracy and query complexity: aggregation error decreases linearly with the number of queries, and vanishes when the \"order of reasoning\" and number of agents relevant to a query is $ω(\\sqrt{n})$. These results demonstrate that modest extensions to the space of expert queries dramatically strengthen the power of robust forecast aggregation. We therefore expect that our new query framework will open up a fruitful line of research in this area."}

We propose a model in which a candidate's priority scores across different decision-makers exhibit varying levels of correlation dependent on the candidate's sociodemographic group. Such differential correlation can arise in school choice due to the varying prevalence of selection criteria, in college admissions due to test-optional policies, or due to algorithmic monoculture, that is, when decision-makers rely on the same algorithms and data sets to evaluate candidates. We show that higher correlation for one of the groups generally improves the outcome for all groups, leading to higher efficiency. However, students from a given group are more likely to remain unmatched as their own correlation level increases. This implies that it is advantageous to belong to a low-correlation group. Finally, we extend the tie-breaking literature to multiple priority classes and intermediate levels of correlation. Overall, our results point to differential correlation as a previously overlooked systemic source of group inequalities in school, university, and job admissions."}

This paper introduces a large-language-model (LLM)-driven conversational assistant that captures such knowledge on the shop floor and converts it incrementally and interactively into standards-compliant Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0 diagrams. Powered by Gemini 2.5 Pro and delivered through a lightweight Gradio front-end with client-side bpmn-js visualisation, the assistant conducts an interview-style dialogue: it elicits process details, supports clarifying dialogue and on-demand analysis, and renders live diagrams that users can refine in real time. A proof-of-concept evaluation in an equipment-maintenance scenario shows that the chatbot produced an accurate \"AS-IS\" model, flagged issues via on-diagram annotations, and generated an improved \"TO-BE\" variant, all within about 12-minutes, while keeping API costs within an SME-friendly budget. The study analyses latency sources, model-selection trade-offs, and the challenges of enforcing strict XML schemas, then outlines a roadmap toward agentic and multimodal deployments. The results demonstrate that conversational LLMs can potentially be used to lower the skill and cost barriers to rigorous process documentation, helping SMEs preserve institutional knowledge, enhance operational transparency, and accelerate continuous-improvement efforts."}

Along with the tunability of the magnon-photon coupling strength, fast information transfer and conversion speed are desired in hybrid devices. This can be achieved utilizing the propagating nature of spin waves with non-zero momentum for their ultra-fast time dynamics and reduced ohmic dissipation. Antiferromagnets are particularly interesting as hosts for magnons since stray-field interactions are minimized, and they support multiple modes with distinctive magnetic-field behavior across the phase diagram. CrCl3 is a van der Waals antiferromagnet having a strong easy-plane anisotropy and a weak in-plane easy-axis anisotropy. Despite some magnetic resonance studies, the impact of magnetic reorientation of spins in CrCl3 on cavity-magnon-polariton interaction strength as a function of magnetic field remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the coupling between magnons in CrCl3 and photons in a coplanar waveguide resonator as a function of magnetic field. In particular, we find that the magnon-photon coupling strength varies nonmonotonically and distinctly with the magnetic field for both acoustic and optical magnons, enabling tuning of the coupling strength with an external magnetic field as a knob. We find the signature of spin-flop transition in two harmonics of the cavity due to a stronger dispersive coupling between optical magnons and cavity photons at lower fields. Additionally, we find standing modes formed by spin waves with nonzero momentum associated with the two hybrid magnons when the external field is applied at an angle with the crystal plane. These modes do not undergo substantial coupling with the cavity mode unlike the antiferromagnetic modes and can be used as low-loss propagation channels in hybrid devices."}

Yet mid-flight reconfiguration presents a critical aerodynamic challenge: tilting propulsors to achieve shape change reduces vertical thrust, undermining stability and control authority. Here, we introduce a passive wake vectoring mechanism that recovers lost thrust during morphing. Integrated into a novel robotic system, Aerially Transforming Morphobot (ATMO), internal deflectors intercept and redirect rotor wake downward, passively steering airflow momentum that would otherwise be wasted. This electronics-free solution achieves up to a 40% recovery of vertical thrust in configurations where no useful thrust would otherwise be produced, substantially extending hover and maneuvering capabilities during transformation. Our findings highlight a new direction for morphing aerial robot design, where passive aerodynamic structures, inspired by thrust vectoring in rockets and aircraft, enable efficient, agile flight without added mechanical complexity."}

We present a novel transformation-based method enabling computation of supported models using standard ASP infrastructure. Our approach transforms any ground logic program into an equivalent program whose stable models correspond exactly to the supported models of the original program. We implement this transformation for Clingo, providing the first practical tool for computing supported models with state-of-the-art ASP solvers.\n  We demonstrate applications in software verification, medical diagnosis, and planning where supported models enable valuable exploratory reasoning capabilities beyond those provided by stable models.

In this setting, each agent's reward depends on its own state-action pair as well as those of its direct neighbors, and each agent's policy is parameterized by its local parameters together with those of its $κ_{p}$-hop neighbors, with $κ_{p}\\geq 1$ denoting the coupled radius. The objective of the agents is to collaboratively optimize their policies to maximize the discounted average cumulative reward. To address the challenge of interdependent policies in collaborative optimization, we introduce a novel concept termed the neighbors' averaged $Q$-function and derive a new expression for the coupled policy gradient. Based on these theoretical foundations, we develop a distributed scalable coupled policy (DSCP) algorithm, where each agent relies only on the state-action pairs of its $κ_{p}$-hop neighbors and the rewards its their $(κ_{p}+1)$-hop neighbors. Specially, in the DSCP algorithm, we employ a geometric 2-horizon sampling method that does not require storing a full $Q$-table to obtain an unbiased estimate of the coupled policy gradient. Moreover, each agent interacts exclusively with its direct neighbors to obtain accurate policy parameters, while maintaining local estimates of other agents' parameters to execute its local policy and collect samples for optimization. These estimates and policy parameters are updated via a push-sum protocol, enabling distributed coordination of policy updates across the network. We prove that the joint policy produced by the proposed algorithm converges to a first-order stationary point of the objective function. Finally, the effectiveness of DSCP algorithm is demonstrated through simulations in a robot path planning environment, showing clear improvement over state-of-the-art methods."}

Nanosheets are subjected to uniaxial, biaxial, and shear loads to investigate their buckling modes, atomic-level deformation mechanisms, and failure characteristics. The results indicate that classical continuum mechanics significantly overestimates the buckling strains. Nanosheets exhibit higher resistance to buckling along the armchair direction than along the zigzag direction. Although atomic-scale defects reduce the buckling stress, they influence deformation only locally and do not alter the global buckling mode shapes. Lateral confinement pressure, such as that caused by polymerization-induced shrinkage in MXene-polymer composites, substantially increases the buckling stress. Oxygen surface termination increases the buckling stress from approximately 1 GPa to 3.5 GPa and reduces directional anisotropy in the elastic response. Under large compressive strains, Ti2CO2 nanosheets fracture, whereas Ti2C nanosheets retain structural integrity at strains exceeding 0.35. Atomistic analysis reveals opposite stress states in the top and bottom Ti layers due to curvature-induced strain gradients. Under biaxial compression, the nanosheet buckles in a dome-like shape, whereas shear loads produce elliptical deflection modes.

The state-of-the-art method attains an absolute-error guarantee epsilon_abs with time complexity O(L^5 / epsilon_abs^2), where L denotes the truncation length. In this work, we improve the complexity to O(L^3 / epsilon^2) under a relative-error guarantee epsilon via probe-driven random walks. We provide a relative-error guarantee rather than an absolute-error guarantee because biharmonic distances vary by orders of magnitude across node pairs. Since L is often very large in real-world networks (for example, L >= 10^3), reducing the L-dependence from the fifth to the third power yields substantial gains. Extensive experiments on real-world networks show that our method delivers 10x-1000x per-query speedups at matched relative error over strong baselines and scales to graphs with tens of millions of nodes."}

To address this limitation, we propose AREA3D, an active reconstruction agent that leverages feed-forward 3D reconstruction models and vision-language guidance. Our framework decouples view-uncertainty modeling from the underlying feed-forward reconstructor, enabling precise uncertainty estimation without expensive online optimization. In addition, an integrated vision-language model provides high-level semantic guidance, encouraging informative and diverse viewpoints beyond purely geometric cues.

We introduce the Continuous Flow Operator (CFO), a framework that learns continuous-time PDE dynamics without the computational burden of standard continuous approaches, e.g., neural ODE. The key insight is repurposing flow matching to directly learn the right-hand side of PDEs without backpropagating through ODE solvers. CFO fits temporal splines to trajectory data, using finite-difference estimates of time derivatives at knots to construct probability paths whose velocities closely approximate the true PDE dynamics. A neural operator is then trained via flow matching to predict these analytic velocity fields. This approach is inherently time-resolution invariant: training accepts trajectories sampled on arbitrary, non-uniform time grids while inference queries solutions at any temporal resolution through ODE integration. Across four benchmarks (Lorenz, 1D Burgers, 2D diffusion-reaction, 2D shallow water), CFO demonstrates superior long-horizon stability and remarkable data efficiency. CFO trained on only 25% of irregularly subsampled time points outperforms autoregressive baselines trained on complete data, with relative error reductions up to 87%. Despite requiring numerical integration at inference, CFO achieves competitive efficiency, outperforming autoregressive baselines using only 50% of their function evaluations, while uniquely enabling reverse-time inference and arbitrary temporal querying."}

Conventional PoA analysis relies on exact numerical costs. However, in many settings, costs represent agents' preferences and may be defined only up to possibly arbitrary scaling and shifting, representing informational and modeling ambiguities. We observe that while such transformations preserve equilibrium and optimal outcomes, they change the PoA value. To resolve this issue, we rely on results from Social Choice Theory and define the Invariant PoA. By connecting admissible transformations to degrees of comparability of agents' costs, we derive the specific social welfare functions which ensure that efficiency evaluations do not depend on arbitrary rescalings or translations of individual costs. Case studies on a toy example and the Zurich network demonstrate that identical tolling strategies can lead to substantially different efficiency estimates depending on the assumed comparability. Our framework thus demonstrates that explicit axiomatic foundations are necessary in order to define efficiency metrics and to appropriately guide policy in large-scale infrastructure design robustly and effectively."}

We propose two new unsupervised metrics for faithfulness evaluation using insights from information theory and thermodynamics. Our approach treats an LLM as a bipartite information engine where hidden layers act as a Maxwell demon controlling transformations of context $C $ into answer $A$ via prompt $Q$. We model Question-Context-Answer (QCA) triplets as probability distributions over shared topics. Topic transformations from $C$ to $Q$ and $A$ are modeled as transition matrices ${\\bf Q}$ and ${\\bf A}$ encoding the query goal and actual result, respectively. Our semantic faithfulness (SF) metric quantifies faithfulness for any given QCA triplet by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between these matrices. Both matrices are inferred simultaneously via convex optimization of this KL divergence, and the final SF metric is obtained by mapping the minimal divergence onto the unit interval [0,1], where higher scores indicate greater faithfulness. Furthermore, we propose a thermodynamics-based semantic entropy production (SEP) metric in answer generation, and show that high faithfulness generally implies low entropy production. The SF and SEP metrics can be used jointly or separately for LLM evaluation and hallucination control. We demonstrate our framework on LLM summarization of corporate SEC 10-K filings."}

We propose a key principle for compositing image latents: Pixel-Equivalent Latent Compositing (PELC). An equivalent latent compositor should be the same as compositing in pixel space. This principle enables full-resolution mask control and true soft-edge alpha compositing, even though VAEs compress images 8x spatially. Modern VAEs capture global context beyond patch-aligned local structure, so linear latent blending cannot be pixel-equivalent: it produces large artifacts at mask seams and global degradation and color shifts. We introduce DecFormer, a 7.7M-parameter transformer that predicts per-channel blend weights and an off-manifold residual correction to realize mask-consistent latent fusion. DecFormer is trained so that decoding after fusion matches pixel-space alpha compositing, is plug-compatible with existing diffusion pipelines, requires no backbone finetuning and adds only 0.07% of FLUX.1-Dev's parameters and 3.5% FLOP overhead. On the FLUX.1 family, DecFormer restores global color consistency, soft-mask support, sharp boundaries, and high-fidelity masking, reducing error metrics around edges by up to 53% over standard mask interpolation. Used as an inpainting prior, a lightweight LoRA on FLUX.1-Dev with DecFormer achieves fidelity comparable to FLUX.1-Fill, a fully finetuned inpainting model. While we focus on inpainting, PELC is a general recipe for pixel-equivalent latent editing, as we demonstrate on a complex color-correction task."}

This paper proposes to address this problem via the development of a scale-agnostic and adaptive ergodic coverage optimization method based on the maximum mean discrepancy metric (MMD). Our approach allows the optimizer to solve for the scale of differential constraints while annealing the hyperparameters to best suit the problem domain and ensure physical consistency. We also derive a variation of the ergodic metric in the log space, providing additional numerical conditioning without loss of performance.

Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are poised to play an integral role in these networks, offering versatile applications and flexible deployment options. However, accurately characterizing the shadow fading (SF) behavior in UAV communications remains a challenge. Traditional SF correlation models rely on spatial distance and neglect the UAV's 3D orientation and elevation angle. Yet even slight variations in pitch angle (5 to 10 degrees) can significantly affect the signal strength observed by a UAV. In this study, we investigate the impact of UAV pitch and elevation geometry on SF and propose an elevation- and tilt-aware spatial correlation model. We use a real-world fixed-altitude UAV measurement dataset collected in a rural environment at 3.32 GHz with a 125 kHz bandwidth. Results show that a 10-degree tilt-angle separation and a 20-degree elevation-angle separation can reduce the SF correlation by up to 15% and 40%, respectively. In addition, integrating the proposed correlation model into the ordinary Kriging (OK) framework for signal strength prediction yields an approximate 1.5 dB improvement in median RMSE relative to the traditional correlation model that ignores UAV orientation and elevation."}

It is a crucial tool in the development of crystalline cohomology; it is also used in $p$-adic Hodge theory to define the crystalline period ring. As an algebra, this universal divided power algebra has a fairly simple definition that shows that it is a graded algebra. The main difficulty in Roby's theorem lies in constructing a divided power structure on its augmentation ideal. To that aim, Roby identified the graded pieces with another universal structure: homogeneous polynomial laws.We formalize the first steps of the theory of polynomial laws and show how future work will allow to complete the formalization of the above-mentioned divided power structure.

We design Non-Stateful (NS) models progressively removing membrane propagation to quantify its stage-wise role. Experiments reveal a counterintuitive phenomenon: moderate removal in shallow or deep layers improves performance, while excessive removal causes collapse. We attribute this to spatio-temporal resource competition where neurons encode both semantics and dynamics within limited range, with temporal state consuming capacity for spatial learning. Based on this, we propose Spatial-Temporal Separable Network (STSep), decoupling residual blocks into independent spatial and temporal branches. The spatial branch focuses on semantic extraction while the temporal branch captures motion through explicit temporal differences. Experiments on Something-Something V2, UCF101, and HMDB51 show STSep achieves superior performance, with retrieval task and attention analysis confirming focus on motion rather than static appearance.

Computational modeling of supported nanoparticles based on density functional theory (DFT) often involves structural searches of stable local minimum energy configurations and molecular dynamics simulations at finite temperature. These are computationally demanding tasks that are intractable within DFT for large systems. In the last two decades, machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have been successfully used to substantially increase the size and time scales accessible to simulations that retain DFT accuracy. However, training reliable MLIPs is non-trivial as it requires many costly DFT calculations. Recently, several universal MLIPs (uMLIPs) have been developed, which are trained on large datasets that cover a wide range of molecules and materials. Here, we benchmark the accuracy and the efficiency of these uMLIPs in describing Cu nanoparticles supported on Al$_2$O$_3$ surfaces against our domain-specific DP-UniAlCu model. We find that the MACE-OMAT can reproduce reasonably well the low-energy configurations found in global optimization at an energy accuracy comparable to DP-UniAlCu. Interestingly, the MatterSim-v1.0.0-1M model, which exhibits larger deviations in the binding energies, can find even more stable configurations than the other two models in some supported nanoparticle sizes, showing its capability in structure exploration. For MD simulations, MACE-OMAT and MatterSim-v1.0.0-1M can qualitatively reproduce the mean-squared displacements of Cu atoms (MSD$_\\mathrm{Cu}$) predicted by DP-UniAlCu, albeit at roughly two orders of magnitude higher cost.

Clinically, volatile biomarkers often signal acute pathophysiology and require more sophisticated modeling to capture their complex temporal patterns. We propose a volatility-aware pretraining strategy, Coefficient of Variation Masking (CV-Masking), that adaptively adjusts masking probabilities according to the intrinsic variability of each feature. Combined with a value-only masking objective aligned with clinical workflows, CV-Masking yields systematic improvements over random and variance-based strategies.

Using finite element simulations, we analyzed how the geometric parameters of this pattern affected the reflectance of the film and the pretension required to resist thermal deformations. Tensile testing of selected designs, which are approximately half the weight of traditional metallic meshes, demonstrated a substantial reduction in the needed pretension to ~0.5 N/m and as low as ~0.1 N/m. Such low pretension represents an order-of-magnitude improvement over traditional metallic mesh reflectors and could enable the use of lighter antenna trusses.

Fixed-site edge servers at Road Side Units (RSUs) or base stations are able to offer basic service coverage for end users, i.e., vehicles on road.

Mobile servers such as buses, on the other hand, have the potential of adding computation elasticity to such system. To this end, this paper studies the feasibility of bus-mounted edge servers based on real traces. First, we investigate the coverage of the buses and base stations using the Shanghai bus/taxi/Telecom datasets, which shows a great potential of bus-based edge servers as they cover a great portion of geographic area and demand points. Next, we build a mathematical model and design a simple greedy heuristic algorithm to select a limited number of buses that maximizes the coverage of demand points, i.e., with a limited purchase budget. We perform trace-driven simulations to verify the performance of the proposed bus selection algorithm. The results show that our approach effectively handles the dynamic user demand under realistic constraints such as server capacity and purchase quantity.

Among the various reinforcement learning methodologies, gradient-based approaches, particularly policy gradient methods, are considered to have many benefits. Moreover, in the quantum regime, they also have a profit in that they can be readily implemented through parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). From the perspective of learning, two indicators can be regarded as most crucial: expressivity and, for gradient-based methods, trainability. While a number of attempts have been made to quantify the expressivity and trainability of PQCs, clear efforts in the context of reinforcement learning have so far been lacking. Therefore, in this study, we newly define the notion of expressivity suited to reinforcement learning and demonstrate that the mutual information between action distribution and reward-signal distribution can, in certain respects, indicate information about both expressivity and trainability. Such research is valuable in that it provides an easy criterion for choosing among various PQCs employed in reinforcement learning, and further, enables the indirect estimation of learning progress even in black-box settings where the agent's achievement aligned with the episodes cannot be explicitly evaluated."}

In normative and empirical fields alike, this insight has led to the conclusion that no single perspective can generate complete knowledge. As a response, epistemological pluralism mandates that researchers consider multiple perspectives simultaneously to obtain a holistic understanding of their phenomenon under study. Translating this mandate to network science, our work introduces Network Pluralism as a conceptual framework that leverages multi-perspectivity to yield more complete, meaningful, and robust results. We develop and demonstrate the benefits of this approach via a hands-on analysis of complex legal systems, constructing a network space from references across documents from different branches of government as well as including organizational hierarchy above and fine-grained structure below the document level. Leveraging the resulting heterogeneity in a multi-network analysis, we show how complementing perspectives can help contextualize otherwise high-level findings, how contrasting several networks derived from the same data enables researchers to learn by difference, and how relating metrics to perspectives may increase the transparency and robustness of network-analytical results. To analyze a space of networks as perspectives, researchers need to map dimensions of variation in a given domain to network-modeling decisions and network-metric parameters. While this remains a challenging and inherently interdisciplinary task, our work acts as a blueprint to facilitate the broader adoption of Network Pluralism in domain-driven network research."}

Existing studies consider maintaining similar error across different resolutions as indicative of successful multi-resolution generalization. However, deep learning models serving as alternatives to numerical solvers should reduce error as resolution increases. The fundamental limitation is, the upper bound of physical law frequencies that low-resolution data can represent is constrained by its Nyquist frequency, making it difficult for models to process signals containing unseen frequency components during high-resolution inference. This results in errors being anchored at low resolution, incorrectly interpreted as successful generalization. We define this fundamental phenomenon as a new problem distinct from existing issues: Scale Anchoring. Therefore, we propose architecture-agnostic Frequency Representation Learning. It alleviates Scale Anchoring through resolution-aligned frequency representations and spectral consistency training: on grids with higher Nyquist frequencies, the frequency response in high-frequency bands of FRL-enhanced variants is more stable. This allows errors to decrease with resolution and significantly outperform baselines within our task and resolution range, while incurring only modest computational overhead."}

Our method combines (i) a syntax-preserving unlearning strategy that safeguards the structural integrity of hardware code during forgetting, and (ii) a fine-grained floor-aware selective loss that enables precise and efficient removal of problematic knowledge. This integration achieves effective unlearning without degrading LLM code generation capabilities. Extensive experiments show that our framework supports forget sets up to 3x larger, typically requiring only a single training epoch, while preserving both syntactic correctness and functional integrity of register-transfer level (RTL) codes.

This Lagrangian correction, which mimics a mass term in field theory, vanishes smoothly as the perturbation is reduced. We also demonstrate that topological edge states in the memristive SSH circuit remain localized at the boundary, protected by custodial chiral symmetry.

Despite recent advancements, many large-scale robotic policies still remain sensitive to key sources of observational variation such as changes in camera perspective, lighting, and the presence of distractor objects. We posit that the limited generalizability of these models arises from the substantial diversity required to robustly cover these quasistatic axes, coupled with the current scarcity of large-scale robotic datasets that exhibit rich variation across them. In this work, we propose to systematically examine what robots need to generalize across these challenging axes by introducing two key auxiliary tasks, state similarity and invariance to observational perturbations, applied to both demonstration data and static visual data. We then show that via these auxiliary tasks, leveraging both more-expensive robotic demonstration data and less-expensive, visually rich synthetic images generated from non-physics-based simulation (for example, Unreal Engine) can lead to substantial increases in generalization to unseen camera viewpoints, lighting configurations, and distractor conditions. Our results demonstrate that co-training on this diverse data improves performance by 18 percent over existing generative augmentation methods.

A data-driven regulator is proposed to achieve asymptotic regulation and closed-loop stability without performing model identification.

For this nominal system, a stabilizing law is derived from an offline dataset that has been acquired from the plant during experiments, such that the system states exponentially converge to a subspace. An identifier in discrete-time is, then, implemented to correct the internal model and update the stabilizing law; as a result, the regulation error can be steered to zero asymptotically under some persistent excitation conditions."}

It has found applications across various fields, including network centrality, graph clustering, and machine learning. These applications typically require efficient evaluation of pairwise biharmonic distances. However, existing algorithms remain computationally expensive. The state-of-the-art method attains an absolute-error guarantee epsilon_abs with time complexity O(L^5 / epsilon_abs^2), where L denotes the truncation length. In this work, we improve the complexity to O(L^3 / epsilon^2) under a relative-error guarantee epsilon via probe-driven random walks. We provide a relative-error guarantee rather than an absolute-error guarantee because biharmonic distances vary by orders of magnitude across node pairs. Since L is often very large in real-world networks (for example, L >= 10^3), reducing the L-dependence from the fifth to the third power yields substantial gains. Extensive experiments on real-world networks show that our method delivers 10x-1000x per-query speedups at matched relative error over strong baselines and scales to graphs with tens of millions of nodes."}

GCC-MSIF introduces a \"mean signal\" estimated from multi-channel inputs and an \"inverse filter\" to virtually reconstruct the source signal, enabling adaptive suppression of out-of-band noise. Numerical simulations simulating a small-scale array demonstrate that GCC-MSIF significantly outperforms conventional methods, such as GCC-PHAT and GCC-SCOT, in low SNR regions and achieves robustness comparable to or exceeding the maximum likelihood (GCC-ML) method. Furthermore, the estimation accuracy improves scalably with the number of array elements.

Conventional PoA analysis relies on exact numerical costs. However, in many settings, costs represent agents' preferences and may be defined only up to possibly arbitrary scaling and shifting, representing informational and modeling ambiguities. We observe that while such transformations preserve equilibrium and optimal outcomes, they change the PoA value. To resolve this issue, we rely on results from Social Choice Theory and define the Invariant PoA. By connecting admissible transformations to degrees of comparability of agents' costs, we derive the specific social welfare functions which ensure that efficiency evaluations do not depend on arbitrary rescalings or translations of individual costs. Case studies on a toy example and the Zurich network demonstrate that identical tolling strategies can lead to substantially different efficiency estimates depending on the assumed comparability. Our framework thus demonstrates that explicit axiomatic foundations are necessary in order to define efficiency metrics and to appropriately guide policy in large-scale infrastructure design robustly and effectively."}

Experiments on challenging benchmark functions demonstrate that WE achieves competitive convergence performance while maintaining dramatically higher population diversity than classical methods (GA, DE, CMA-ES).This superior entropy preservation enables effective navigation of multi-modal landscapes without premature convergence, validating the physical interpretation of optimization as a disorder-to-order transition.

We report on the development of a tube transducer from a single element radially poled tubular piezoceramic, excited to generate an axially focused field.

Using quantile-based change metrics, this matrix specifies which module at which step is reused rather than recomputed. The same invariance criterion is applied at the step scale to enable cross-timestep caching, deciding whether an entire step can reuse cached results. During inference, InvarDiff performs step-first and layer-wise caching guided by this matrix. When applied to DiT and FLUX, our approach reduces redundant compute while preserving fidelity.

The discussion that followed has emphasized a basic point: writing down coordinate maps is not the same thing as providing a physical theory. In particular, quantum superposition is not operationally defined by drawing multiple paths on paper: it is defined by what happens when alternatives recombine in an interference loop [2, 3]. In parallel, careful 1+1 analyses have clarified how sign conventions and time-orientation choices enter the superluminal formulas [4]. Finally, tachyonic QFT proposals suggest a possible mathematical bridge via an enlarged (twin) Hilbert space [5], although this proposal remains contested (e.g., on commutator covariance and microcausality grounds) [6]. The aim of this short note is organizational. We keep three layers separate: (K) kinematics (which maps exist and what they preserve), (O) operational content (what an experiment must actually reproduce, especially closed-loop interference), and (D/B) dynamics and bridges (how amplitudes and probabilities are generated, and how subluminal and superluminal sectors might be linked).

We empirically observe there exists feature invariance in deterministic sampling, and present InvarDiff, a training-free acceleration method that exploits the relative temporal invariance across timestep-scale and layer-scale. From a few deterministic runs, we compute a per-timestep, per-layer, per-module binary cache plan matrix and use a re-sampling correction to avoid drift when consecutive caches occur. Using quantile-based change metrics, this matrix specifies which module at which step is reused rather than recomputed. The same invariance criterion is applied at the step scale to enable cross-timestep caching, deciding whether an entire step can reuse cached results. During inference, InvarDiff performs step-first and layer-wise caching guided by this matrix. When applied to DiT and FLUX, our approach reduces redundant compute while preserving fidelity. Experiments show that InvarDiff achieves $2$-$3\\times$ end-to-end speed-ups with minimal impact on standard quality metrics. Qualitatively, we observe almost no degradation in visual quality compared with full computations."}

Here, we present the first demonstration of a second-order optimizer powered by in-memory analog matrix computing (AMC) using resistive random-access memory (RRAM), which performs matrix inversion (INV) in a single step. We validate the optimizer by training a two-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) for handwritten letter classification, achieving 26% and 61% fewer training epochs than SGD with momentum and Adam, respectively. On a larger task using the same second-order method, our system delivers a 5.88x improvement in throughput and a 6.9x gain in energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art digital processors. These results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of AMC circuits for second-order neural network training, opening a new path toward energy-efficient AI acceleration."}

So much so that many wonder how close humanity is to developing an A.I. model that can achieve human level of intelligence, also known as artificial general intelligence (A.G.I.). In this work we look at this question and we attempt to define the upper bounds, not just of A.I., but rather of any machine-computable process (a.k.a. an algorithm). To answer this question however, one must first precisely define A.G.I. We borrow prior work's definition of A.G.I. [1] that best describes the sentiment of the term, as used by the leading developers of A.I. That is, the ability to be creative and innovate in some field of study in a way that unlocks new and previously unknown functional capabilities in that field. Based on this definition we draw new bounds on the limits of computation. We formally prove that no algorithm can demonstrate new functional capabilities that were not already present in the initial algorithm itself. Therefore, no algorithm (and thus no A.I. model) can be truly creative in any field of study, whether that is science, engineering, art, sports, etc. In contrast, A.I. models can demonstrate existing functional capabilities, as well as combinations and permutations of existing functional capabilities. We conclude this work by discussing the implications of this proof both as it regards to the future of A.I. development, as well as to what it means for the origins of human intelligence."}

Prior neural simulators often rely on extensive ground truth data or sacrifice fine-scale detail, and generalize poorly across resolutions and motion patterns. In contrast, FNOpt learns to simulate physically plausible cloth dynamics and achieves stable and accurate rollouts across diverse mesh resolutions and motion patterns without retraining. Trained only on a coarse grid with physics-based losses, FNOpt generalizes to finer resolutions, capturing fine-scale wrinkles and preserving rollout stability. Extensive evaluations on a benchmark cloth simulation dataset demonstrate that FNOpt outperforms prior learning-based approaches in out-of-distribution settings in both accuracy and robustness. These results position FNO-based meta-optimization as a compelling alternative to previous neural simulators for cloth, thus reducing the need for curated data and improving cross-resolution reliability."}

This paper presents XR-DT, an eXtended Reality-enhanced Digital Twin framework for agentic mobile robots, that bridges physical and virtual spaces to enable bi-directional understanding between humans and robots. Our hierarchical XR-DT architecture integrates virtual-, augmented-, and mixed-reality layers, fusing real-time sensor data, simulated environments in the Unity game engine, and human feedback captured through wearable AR devices. Within this framework, we design an agentic mobile robot system with a unified diffusion policy for context-aware task adaptation. We further propose a chain-of-thought prompting mechanism that allows multimodal large language models to reason over human instructions and environmental context, while leveraging an AutoGen-based multi-agent coordination layer to enhance robustness and collaboration in dynamic tasks.

We address this by deriving gradient computation through spike event queues, including delays, and implementing memory-efficient, gradient-enabled event queue structures. These are benchmarked across CPU, GPU, TPU, and LPU platforms. We find that queue design strongly shapes performance. CPUs, as expected, perform well with traditional tree-based or FIFO implementations, while GPUs excel with ring buffers for smaller simulations, yet under higher memory pressure prefer more sparse data-structures. TPUs seem to favor an implementation based on sorting intrinsics. Selective spike dropping provides a simple performance-accuracy trade-off, which could be enhanced by future autograd frameworks adapting diverging primal/tangent data-structures."}

We hypothesize that combining pre-trained Protein Language Models (PLMs) with Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) can retain high predictive accuracy even when labeled data are scarce. We evaluated two SSL strategies, Self-training and Label Spreading, against fully supervised baselines using four PLM-derived embeddings (ESM-2, ProtVec, ProtT5, ProtBert) applied to haemagglutinin (HA) sequences. A nested cross-validation framework simulated low-label regimes (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% label availability) across four IAV subtypes (H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H9N2). SSL consistently improved performance under label scarcity. Self-training with ProtVec produced the largest relative gains, showing that SSL can compensate for lower-resolution representations. ESM-2 remained highly robust, achieving F1 scores above 0.82 with only 25% labeled data, indicating that its embeddings capture key antigenic determinants. While H1N1 and H9N2 were predicted with high accuracy, the hypervariable H3N2 subtype remained challenging, although SSL mitigated the performance decline. These findings demonstrate that integrating PLMs with SSL can address the antigenicity labeling bottleneck and enable more effective use of unlabeled surveillance sequences, supporting rapid variant prioritization and timely vaccine strain selection."}

To address this, we propose a privacy-preserving fully distributed GPR protocol based on secure multi-party computation (SMPC) that preserves the confidentiality of each agent's local dataset. Building upon a secure distributed average consensus algorithm, the protocol guarantees that each agent's local model practically converges to the same global model that would be obtained by the standard distributed GPR. Further, we adopt the paradigm of simulation based security to provide formal privacy guarantees, and extend the proposed protocol to enable kernel hyperparameter optimization, which is critical yet often overlooked in the literature. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and practical applicability of the proposed method."}

By enabling interconnections between RIS elements, BD-RIS architectures offer greater flexibility in wave manipulation compared to traditional diagonal RIS designs. However, these interconnections introduce new research challenges for channel estimation, making existing approaches developed for conventional diagonal RISs ineffective and significantly increasing pilot overhead. To address these challenges, we propose a novel individual channel estimation framework that separately estimates the BS-RIS channel, which typically remains static over time, and the RIS-user channels, which vary rapidly due to user mobility. Specifically, we develop a full-duplex (FD) approach to estimate the BS-RIS channel by leveraging its inherent sparsity. Following this, the RIS-user channels are estimated using a least squares (LS) approach. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significantly higher channel estimation accuracy, particularly when the number of RIS elements is large, while substantially reducing pilot overhead compared to conventional cascaded channel estimation methods."}

We validate the optimizer by training a two-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) for handwritten letter classification, achieving 26% and 61% fewer training epochs than SGD with momentum and Adam, respectively. On a larger task using the same second-order method, our system delivers a 5.88x improvement in throughput and a 6.9x gain in energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art digital processors.

This unified framework enables direct cross-model optimal transport, interpretable embedding arithmetic, and the detection of representational biases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that geometric distortions in this space can indicate physical prediction failures, including symmetry breaking and incorrect phonon dispersions. Our results show that the latent spaces of diverse MLIPs present consistent statistical geometry shaped by shared physical and chemical constraints, suggesting that the Platonic representation offers a practical route toward interoperable, comparable, and interpretable foundation models for materials science."}

We consider two specific discrepancy measures -- correlation alignment and the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) -- and derive ad hoc stratification objectives for these terms. We then present expected and worst-case error bounds, and prove that our proposed objective for the MMD is theoretically optimal (i.e., minimises the variance) under certain assumptions.

Focusing on a 3-level Tavis-Cummings model in a far detuned limit, we detail its deep Hilbert space structure -- i.e. we enumerate all distinct dynamical sectors, beyond the totally symmetric subspace -- by using the Schur-Weyl duality, which is applicable thanks to the permutation symmetry in the all-to-all Hamiltonian. Strong Hilbert space fragmentation ensues from the non-abelian nature of the symmetry, with some sectors displaying regular dynamics and others being chaotic. We uncover that many permutation symmetry sectors contribute to the dynamics in the classical limit, in addition to the commonly studied totally symmetric subspace. To elucidate the dynamical responses in each of the symmetry sectors, we propose a semiclassical description in terms of spin coherent states, which is also able to explain the origin of chaotic or regular dynamics with a simple geometrical argument.

To address these limitations, this paper presents a contactless and non-invasive in-vivo monitoring system based on a low-power 60 GHz frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar. The proposed system enables simultaneous detection of rodent activity and vital signs directly within home-cage environments, eliminating the need for implants, electrodes, or human intervention. The hardware platform leverages a compact Infineon BGT60 series radar sensor, optimized for low power consumption and continuous operation. We investigate sensor placement strategies and design a complete signal processing pipeline, including range bin selection, phase extraction, and frequency-domain estimation tailored to rodent vital signs. The system achieves 3 cm and 0.1 m/s sensitivity for motion and activity detection, while allowing discrimination of micro-movements associated with cardiopulmonary activity with a 2 um distance resolution. Experimental validation with two rodents in realistic in-vivo cages demonstrates that the radar can track animal position and extract respiration rates with 2 bpm accuracy. By minimizing stress and disturbance, this work improves both animal welfare and the reliability of physiological measurements, offering a refined alternative to traditional monitoring methods. This work represents the first demonstration of continuous radar-based vital sign monitoring in freely moving rodents within group-housed cages.

Despite mining's evolution into a capital-intensive industry, there is little guidance on when to purchase new Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) hardware, and no prior computational frameworks address this decision problem. We address this gap by formulating hardware acquisition as a time series classification task, predicting whether purchasing ASIC machines yields profitable (Return on Investment (ROI) >= 1), marginal (0 < ROI < 1), or unprofitable (ROI <= 0) returns within one year. We propose MineROI-Net, an open source Transformer-based architecture designed to capture multi-scale temporal patterns in mining profitability.

An altermagnetic (AM) half-metal cannot exist due to its AM spin splitting, while a fully-compensated ferrimagnetic (FC-FIM) metal seems impossible to realize because both spin channels remain gapless. Here, we propose that an FC-FIM metal can be realized by breaking the rotational or mirror symmetry that links two spin-opposite magnetic atoms in an AM metal. We further demonstrate that charge-carrier doping is fundamentally unable to generate a net magnetic moment in an altermagnet, whereas such a net moment can be readily induced in a fully-compensated ferrimagnet. We use the AM monolayer $\\mathrm{Cr_2O}$ as a concrete example to validate our proposal. Either electric field or uniaxial strain can break the $S_{4z}$ symmetry of $\\mathrm{Cr_2O}$, thereby inducing a transition from an AM metal to an FC-FIM metal. Uniaxial strain plus carrier doping creates a net moment in an altermagnet, and the so-called piezomagnetism is essentially a strain-driven switch from altermagnetism to fully-compensated ferrimagnetism. By analogy, we advance the concept of electromagnetism: an electric field drives the transition from altermagnetism to fully-compensated ferrimagnetism, and subsequent charge-carrier doping stabilizes a net magnetization. Our work provides a roadmap for further exploring the connection and distinction between altermagnet and fully-compensated ferrimagnet, and confirms the feasibility of FC-FIM metal."}

Our application uses NASA's MERRA-2 reanalysis as the low resolution source domain (50 km) and the GEOS-5 Nature Run (G5NR) as the high resolution target (7 km). Our study area included a large area in Asia, which was made computationally tractable by splitting into two subregions and four seasons. We conducted domain similarity analysis using Wasserstein distances confirmed minimal distributional shift between MERRA-2 and G5NR, validating the safety of parameter frozen transfer. Across seasonal regional splits, our model achieved excellent performance (R2 = 0.65 to 0.94), outperforming comparison models including deterministic U-Nets, variational autoencoders, and prior transfer learning baselines. Out of data evaluations using semivariograms, ACF/PACF, and lag-based RMSE/R2 demonstrated that the predicted downscaled images preserved physically consistent spatial variability and temporal autocorrelation, enabling stable autoregressive reconstruction beyond the G5NR record.

Existing attempts to stop early either manipulate decoding with extra sampling and heuristics, rely on auxiliary verifier models, or operate only as post-hoc analysis pipelines without formal guarantees. We introduce LYNX, an online early-exit mechanism that turns a model's own hidden-state awareness into confidence-controlled stopping decisions. LYNX attaches exit decisions to naturally occurring reasoning cues (e.g., \"hmm\", \"wait\") during generation, trains a lightweight probe on hidden states at those cue tokens using supervision from forced exits, and wraps the resulting scores in split conformal prediction to obtain distribution-free control over premature exits. Crucially, we train and calibrate this probe once on a generic mathematical corpus and reuse it unchanged across benchmarks, decoding temperatures, and even non-mathematical tasks. Across three model families spanning 1.5B to 32B parameters, a single mathematically trained probe per base model yields strong accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs. On GSM8K, LYNX matches or improves baseline accuracy while reducing tokens by 40--65\\%; on MATH-500 it improves accuracy by up to 12 points with roughly 35--60\\% fewer tokens; on AIME 2024 it recovers baseline accuracy with more than 50\\% token savings; and on CommonsenseQA, a non-math benchmark, it transfers zero-shot with modest accuracy gains and up to 70\\% fewer tokens.

This integration allows intelligent agents to reason over extended periods, collaborate securely, and adhere to authentic clinical logic, representing a significant shift away from traditional Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) and prompt-based Large Language Models (LLMs). As healthcare systems become more complex, the need for autonomous, context-aware clinical reasoning frameworks has become urgent. We present MCP-AI, a novel architecture for explainable medical decision-making built upon the Model Context Protocol (MCP) a modular, executable specification for orchestrating generative and descriptive AI agents in real-time workflows. Each MCP file captures clinical objectives, patient context, reasoning state, and task logic, forming a reusable and auditable memory object.

Nonequilibrium quasiparticles, which are broken Cooper pairs that cause decoherence and energy loss, can limit their performance. The number of these quasiparticles is often tens of orders of magnitude greater than would be present in thermal equilibrium. Background radiation has been shown to excite quasiparticles, but quasiparticles are observed even when the devices are carefully shielded. Here we show that the high-frequency components of 1/f noise can excite quasiparticle pairs and that this mechanism is consistent with previously unexplained experimental results. We also propose new experiments that exploit this quasiparticle excitation mechanism to non-invasively characterize high-frequency charge noise as well as the locations and nature of the defects producing the noise. The proposed experiments would also investigate how this noise changes as the defects that give rise to it evolve towards thermal equilibrium."}

We model SIMs as trainable linear operators capable of emulating both supervised linear aligners and zero-shot Parseval-frame-based equalizers. To realize these operators physically, we develop a gradient-based optimization procedure that tailors the metasurface transfer function to a desired semantic mapping. Experiments with heterogeneous vision transformer (ViT) encoders show that SIMs can accurately reproduce both supervised and zero-shot semantic equalizers, achieving up to 90% task accuracy in regimes with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), while maintaining strong robustness even at low SNR values."}

However, because reconstructions occur at the atomic level, direct observation and elucidation of the underlying mechanism are challenging for conventional powder type catalysts with ill defined lattices.

Based on the mass activity at overpotential 100 mV, the intrinsic HER performance increases dramatically from 0.11 to 7.72 A/mg immediately after the initial HER cycle and eventually saturates at 1.05 A/mg after continuous operation. The formation of Ru clusters on the catalyst surface, driven by selective Ba leaching under alkaline HER conditions, is observed experimentally. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that HER activity increased with enhanced H* adsorption owing to the dynamic Ru6 cluster formation. A strategy for stabilizing the 'awakened' active surface of BRO is further proposed by validating that the atomic-scale control of the film thickness can effectively maintain the highly active state. This study offers fundamental insights into the design and stabilization of the highly active Ru-based electrocatalysts for the alkaline HER."}

However, 1-WL does not leverage any edge features (labels), presenting a potential improvement on exploiting edge features in some fields. To address this limitation, we proposed a novel Edged-WL algorithm (E-WL) which extends the original 1-WL algorithm to incorporate edge features. Building upon the E-WL algorithm, we also introduce an Edged Graph Isomorphism Network (EGIN) model for further exploiting edge features, which addresses one key drawback in many GNNs that do not utilize any edge features of graph data.

The lack of a full inversion symmetry allows the coupling of the charge current and spin density. In this paper we investigate this phenomenon when the in-plane rotational symmetry is lowered to the $C_{2v}$ and $C_{3v}$ symmetry groups, whereby the electron spectrum becomes anisotropic. We find that in the $C_{2v}$ case, depending on the ratio between the Rashba SOC strengths along the principal axes, the non-equilibrium spin density deviates notably from the $90^o$ degrees rotation, with respect to the applied electric field, familiar in the isotropic case. In the $C_{3v}$ case, when a warping cubic-in-momentum term is present, whereas the standard $90^o$ degrees rotation of the spin density remains, the spin-charge interconversion depends on the intensity of the warping itself. The microscopic theory takes into account disorder including vertex corrections, both via the diagrammatic implementation of the Kubo formula and via the quantum kinetic theory. We show that vertex corrections are crucial to capture the details of the inverse spin galvanic effect in contrast to previous treatments based on the constant broadening approximation."}

Nevertheless, most existing FAMA studies focus on downlink transmission under perfect channel state information (CSI) at the receiver side, while the uplink counterpart remains largely unexplored. This paper proposes a novel codebook-based port selection and combining (CPSC) FAMA framework for the uplink communications without CSI at the base station (BS). In the proposed scheme, a predefined codebook is designed and broadcast by the BS. Each user equipment (UE) employs a fluid antenna, acquires its local CSI and independently chooses the most suitable codeword, activates the corresponding fluid antenna ports, and determines the combining weights to achieve a two-way match between the selected codeword and the instantaneous effective channel. The BS then separates the superimposed user signals through codebook-guided projection operations without requiring global CSI or multiuser joint optimization. To handle potential codeword collisions, three lightweight scheduling strategies are introduced, offering flexible trade-offs between signaling overhead and collision avoidance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CPSC-FAMA approach achieves substantially higher rates than fixed-antenna systems while maintaining low complexity. Moreover, the results confirm that amortizing the optimization cost over the UEs effectively reduces the BS processing burden and enhances scalability, making the proposed scheme a strong candidate for future sixth-generation (6G) networks."}

In insulating helimagnets, known as multiferroics, the cycloidal spin structure induces electric polarization by utilizing the inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya mechanism. Spin-polarized neutron diffraction experiments, which directly probe circular spin arrangements, clearly demonstrated that an electric field controlled the chirality in multiferroic helimagnets. On the other hand, it was unclear until recently how the chirality could be controlled in metallic helimagnets where a large electric field cannot be applied, while the chirality control technique in metallic helimagnets should enable the exploration of chirality-dependent spintronic functionalities. Recently, Jiang et al. succeeded in controlling the chirality of a spiral structure by the simultaneous application of a magnetic field and electric current in a metallic helimagnet, utilizing the nonreciprocal electronic transport as an indirect probe of chirality, highlighting the need for a neutron diffraction experiment that directly probes the chirality.

Through a comparative analysis of influence functions across language and vision tasks, we identify subsets of training data with negligible impact on model outputs.

These models are typically built upon multi-step frameworks like diffusion and flow matching, which inherently limits their inference efficiency (requiring 40-100 Number of Function Evaluations (NFEs)). While various few-step methods aim to accelerate the inference, existing solutions have clear limitations. Prominent distillation-based methods, such as progressive and consistency distillation, either require an iterative distillation procedure or show significant degradation at very few steps (< 4-NFE). Meanwhile, integrating adversarial training into distillation (e.g., DMD/DMD2 and SANA-Sprint) to enhance performance introduces training instability, added complexity, and high GPU memory overhead due to the auxiliary trained models. To this end, we propose TwinFlow, a simple yet effective framework for training 1-step generative models that bypasses the need of fixed pretrained teacher models and avoids standard adversarial networks during training, making it ideal for building large-scale, efficient models. On text-to-image tasks, our method achieves a GenEval score of 0.83 in 1-NFE, outperforming strong baselines like SANA-Sprint (a GAN loss-based framework) and RCGM (a consistency-based framework). Notably, we demonstrate the scalability of TwinFlow by full-parameter training on Qwen-Image-20B and transform it into an efficient few-step generator. With just 1-NFE, our approach matches the performance of the original 100-NFE model on both the GenEval and DPG-Bench benchmarks, reducing computational cost by $100\\times$ with minor quality degradation.

Despite many advantages, LM judges display concerning biases that can impair their integrity in evaluations. One such bias is self-preference: LM judges preferring their own answers over those produced by other LMs or humans. The bias is hard to eliminate as frontier LM judges can distinguish their own outputs from those of others, even when the evaluation candidates are not labeled with their sources. In this paper, we investigate strategies to mitigate self-preference by reducing the LM judges' ability to recognize their own outputs. We apply black-box perturbations to evaluation candidates in pairwise comparison to obfuscate the authorship and reduce self-recognition. We find that perturbations as simple as synonym replacement for a few words predictably reduce self-preference. However, we also uncover fundamental challenges to eliminating the bias: when we extrapolate our perturbations to a more complete neutralization of stylistic differences between the evaluation candidates, self-preference recovers. Our findings suggest that self-recognition and self-preference can happen on many semantic levels, and complete mitigation remains challenging despite promising initial results."}

Effective exciton-magnon coupling arises from an orbital mechanism: Magnons tilt the layer magnetizations, enabling charge carrier tunneling that mixes intra- and interlayer excitons and thereby modulate the exciton energy. We derive the effective Hamiltonian of exciton-magnon coupling, based on our calculation of the magnon spectrum taking into account short-range exchange interaction between Cr-ion spins, single-ion anisotropy, and long-range dipole-dipole interactions. The latter produces a negative group velocity of magnons at small wavevectors. We show that despite rather small renormalization of exciton's energy and effective mass by the exciton-magnon interaction, the three key two-magnon processes: exciton-magnon scattering, two-magnon absorption by exciton, and two-magnon emission are highly efficient. By solving the Boltzmann kinetic equation, we evaluate short exciton-magnon scattering time which is in the sub-ps range and strongly decreases with the increase of magnon population. Hence, exciton-magnon scattering is likely to be dominant over other scattering processes related to the exciton-phonon and exciton-disorder interactions. We demonstrate that magnons can efficiently drag excitons, resulting in a large and nearly isotropic exciton propagation that can significantly exceed the intrinsic anisotropic diffusion. Our results provide a theoretical basis for recent observations of anomalous exciton transport in CrSBr [F. Dirnberger, et al., Nat. Nano. (2025)] and establish magnon-exciton drag as a powerful mechanism for controlling exciton propagation in magnetic systems."}

Here, we investigate the effect of compression rates on the crystallization pathways of 25 wt% NH3 aqueous solutions at room temperature using dynamically compressed diamond anvil cells (dDAC) coupled with time-resolved X-ray diffraction. We show that compression rates exceeding 0.5 GPa/sec promote direct crystallization of a body-centered cubic (bcc) phase (DMA') with possible AMH stoichiometry coexisting with H2O ice VII, while rates below 0.2 GPa/sec stabilize monoclinic NH3-rich AHH-II and ice VII phases. Intermediate rates between 0.2-0.5 GPa/sec produce a mixture of both hydrates alongside ice VII, hence demonstrating the role of compression rate on the crystallization sequence of ammonia solutions. The compression behavior and phase stability of the distinct phase assemblies (AHH-II/DMA' + ice VII) are investigated further to place constraints on the composition of the DMA' phase, the effect of ice VII on the compressibility of ammonia hydrates, and the plausible incorporation of NH3 impurities within the lattice of high-pressure ice phases."}

We establish a framework for performing such simulations on a quantum computer and apply it to a heavy quark moving across a modest-sized 1+1D SU(2) lattice of light quarks. Conceptual advances with regard to simulations of non-Abelian versus Abelian theories are developed, allowing for the evolution of the energy in light quarks, of their local non-Abelian charge densities, and of their multi-partite entanglement to be computed. The non-trivial action of non-Abelian charge operators on arbitrary states suggests mapping the heavy quarks to qubits alongside the light quarks, and limits the heavy-quark motion to discrete steps among spatial lattice sites. Further, the color entanglement among the heavy quarks and light quarks is implemented using hadronic operators, and Domain Decomposition is shown to be effective in quantum state preparation. Scalable quantum circuits that account for the heterogeneity of non-Abelian charge sectors across the lattice are used to prepare the interacting ground-state wavefunction in the presence of heavy quarks. The discrete motion of heavy quarks between adjacent spatial sites is implemented using fermionic SWAP operations. Quantum simulations of the dynamics of a system on $L=3$ spatial sites are performed using IBM's ${\\tt ibm\\_pittsburgh}$ quantum computer using 18 qubits, for which the circuits for state preparation, motion, and one second-order Trotter step of time evolution have a two-qubit depth of 398.

Meanwhile, we design a Progressive Two-stage Correction Learning (P2CL) strategy. The first phase enhances multi-rationale positive learning, while the second phase enables active logic discrimination and correction. In addition, to mitigate representation entanglement in the multi-rationale semantic space, we propose a Multi-rationale Contrastive Alignment (MCA) optimization strategy, which achieves semantic aggregation of correct reasoning and boundary separation of incorrect reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MIND reasoning framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple public datasets covering scientific, commonsense, and mathematical scenarios.

To address this issue, a Residual Variance Matching Recursive Least Squares (RVM-RLS) filter, guided by a Residual Variance Matching Estimation (RVME) criterion, is proposed to adaptively estimate the real-time waypoints of nonlinear, time-varying UAV-based terrain following systems. The proposed method is validated using a UAV-based online terrain following system within a simulated terrain environment. Experimental results show that the RVM-RLS filter improves waypoints estimation accuracy by approximately 88$\\%$ compared with benchmark algorithms across multiple evaluation metrics.

Yet the origin of the frequently observed logarithmic (ln) dependence of the apparent thermal response on hotspot size in crystalline silicon, and the role of individual phonon modes in this regime, remain unclear. Here, we develop a semianalytical, mode-resolved framework in the spectral phonon mean free path (MFP) domain and validate it against a full-phonon-dispersion Boltzmann transport model for heat removal from a 10 x 10 nm^2 hotspot in a thin Si layer (thicknesses of 41, 78, and 177 nm) representative of a silicon-on-insulator transistor. We show that ln-type quasiballistic scaling arises only for modes that lie on a log-uniform conductivity plateau and are diffusive-side or quasiballistic with respect to the hotspot size, whereas fully ballistic long-MFP modes contribute a saturated, nonlogarithmic background, leading to extremely slow suppression of their heat-carrying capability. The resulting phonon-modal nonlocal spectrum establishes spectral selection rules for ln-regime transport in confined Si and provides a compact basis for incorporating mode-selective quasiballistic corrections into continuum thermal models and for interpreting phonon-resolved thermometry experiments."}

We propose RKHS--SHAP-based Advanced Actor--Critic (RSA2C), an attribution-aware, kernelized, two-timescale AC algorithm, including Actor, Value Critic, and Advantage Critic. The Actor is instantiated in a vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) with a Mahalanobis-weighted operator-valued kernel, while the Value Critic and Advantage Critic reside in scalar RKHSs.

State attributions, computed from the Value Critic via RKHS--SHAP (kernel mean embedding for on-manifold expectations and conditional mean embedding for off-manifold expectations), are converted into Mahalanobis-gated weights that modulate Actor gradients and Advantage Critic targets.

Of particular interest for near-term demonstrations of quantum computational advantage are analog quantum simulations, which employ analog controls instead of digitized gates. Most analog quantum simulations to date, however, have been performed using qubit-based processors, despite the fact that many physical systems are more naturally represented in terms of qudits (i.e., $d$-level systems). Motivated by this, we present an experimental realization of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model using an analog simulator based on a single superconducting transmon qudit with up to $d = 9$ levels. This is accomplished by moving to a rotated frame in which evolution under any time-dependent local field and one-axis twisting can be realized by the application of multiple simultaneous drives. Combining this analog drive scheme with universal control and single-shot readout of the qudit state, we provide a detailed study of five finite-size precursors of quantum criticality in the LMG model: dynamical phase transitions, closing of the energy gap, Kibble-Zurek-like dynamics, statistics of the order parameter, and excited-state phase transitions. For each experiment we devise a protocol for extracting the relevant properties which does not require any prior knowledge of the system eigenstates, and can therefore be readily extended to higher dimensions or more complicated models. Our results cement high-dimensional transmon qudits as an exciting path towards simulating many-body physics."}

To tackle this problem, we introduce Enhanced Semantic Motion Representations (Semore), a new VLM-based framework for visual RL, which can simultaneously extract semantic and motion representations through a dual-path backbone from the RGB flows. Semore utilizes VLM with common-sense knowledge to retrieve key information from observations, while using the pre-trained clip to achieve the text-image alignment, thereby embedding the ground-truth representations into the backbone. To efficiently fuse semantic and motion representations for decision-making, our method adopts a separately supervised approach to simultaneously guide the extraction of semantics and motion, while allowing them to interact spontaneously.

To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose the Sparse-Quantized Format (SQ-format), which is a unified data format for quantization and sparsification potentially easily supported by new hardware and existing GPUs. SQ-format makes use of the fact that sparse matrix can be accelerated in high-precision, and low-precision matrix multiplication can also be accelerated accordingly. As such, SQ-format is proposed to achieve Pareto improvement between performance and throughput. This format is particularly suitable for activations with outlier inequality status and makes their static compression possible.

To begin with, predicted trajectories from the trained predictor and their ground truth are projected onto the map-derived reference routes within the Frenet coordinate system. We then employ CopulaCPTS as the conformal calibration method to generate temporal prediction intervals for distinct scenarios as the uncertainty measure. Building upon this, within the proposed trajectory reliability discriminator (TRD), mean error and calibrated confidence intervals are synergistically analyzed to establish reliability models for different scenarios. Subsequently, the risk-aware discriminator leverages a joint risk model that integrates longitudinal and lateral prediction intervals within the Frenet coordinate to identify critical points. This enables segmentation of trajectories into reliable and unreliable segments, holding the advantage of informing downstream planning modules with actionable reliability results. We evaluated our framework using the real-world nuPlan dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in scenario-aware uncertainty quantification and reliability assessment across diverse driving contexts."}

Here we demonstrate that three universal machine-learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) - MACE-MATPES-PBE-0, Orb-v3, and SevenNet-0 can efficiently map the energetics of C, N, O, and H interstitials in a Ti-23Nb-0.7Ta-2Zr gum metal base alloy while being several orders of magnitude faster than density functional theory (DFT). All uMLIPs predict broad energy distributions (1-3 eV) for all four interstitial elements, reflecting their strong sensitivity to local lattice chemistry. Despite alloy disorder, MACE-MATPES-PBE-0 and Orb-v3 reproduce the expected site preferences of the bcc structure: C, N, and O relax into octahedral sites, whereas H stabilizes in tetrahedral positions. In contrast, SevenNet-0 predicts H to be most stable in octahedral coordination, indicating a limitation of this model. Correlation analysis reveals two dominant chemical trends: Ti-rich environments strongly stabilize interstitials, whereas close proximity to Nb is destabilizing; Zr and Ta show no statistically significant influence, likely due to their low concentrations. Benchmarking representative O interstitial configurations against DFT confirms that the uMLIPs reasonably reproduce the energetic ordering of chemically distinct environments. Overall, these results demonstrate that uMLIPs enable computationally efficient, statistically converged characterization of defect energetics in gum metal base alloy and provide insight into how local chemical environments govern interstitial stability."}

We introduce the Continuous Flow Operator (CFO), a framework that learns continuous-time PDE dynamics without the computational burden of standard continuous approaches, e.g., neural ODE. The key insight is repurposing flow matching to directly learn the right-hand side of PDEs without backpropagating through ODE solvers. CFO fits temporal splines to trajectory data, using finite-difference estimates of time derivatives at knots to construct probability paths whose velocities closely approximate the true PDE dynamics. A neural operator is then trained via flow matching to predict these analytic velocity fields. This approach is inherently time-resolution invariant: training accepts trajectories sampled on arbitrary, non-uniform time grids while inference queries solutions at any temporal resolution through ODE integration. Across four benchmarks (Lorenz, 1D Burgers, 2D diffusion-reaction, 2D shallow water), CFO demonstrates superior long-horizon stability and remarkable data efficiency. CFO trained on only 25% of irregularly subsampled time points outperforms autoregressive baselines trained on complete data, with relative error reductions up to 87%. Despite requiring numerical integration at inference, CFO achieves competitive efficiency, outperforming autoregressive baselines using only 50% of their function evaluations, while uniquely enabling reverse-time inference and arbitrary temporal querying."}

We propose a key principle for compositing image latents: Pixel-Equivalent Latent Compositing (PELC). An equivalent latent compositor should be the same as compositing in pixel space. This principle enables full-resolution mask control and true soft-edge alpha compositing, even though VAEs compress images 8x spatially. Modern VAEs capture global context beyond patch-aligned local structure, so linear latent blending cannot be pixel-equivalent: it produces large artifacts at mask seams and global degradation and color shifts. We introduce DecFormer, a 7.7M-parameter transformer that predicts per-channel blend weights and an off-manifold residual correction to realize mask-consistent latent fusion. DecFormer is trained so that decoding after fusion matches pixel-space alpha compositing, is plug-compatible with existing diffusion pipelines, requires no backbone finetuning and adds only 0.07% of FLUX.1-Dev's parameters and 3.5% FLOP overhead. On the FLUX.1 family, DecFormer restores global color consistency, soft-mask support, sharp boundaries, and high-fidelity masking, reducing error metrics around edges by up to 53% over standard mask interpolation. Used as an inpainting prior, a lightweight LoRA on FLUX.1-Dev with DecFormer achieves fidelity comparable to FLUX.1-Fill, a fully finetuned inpainting model.

Ontology learning, aimed at automating this process, has seen advancements in the past decade with the improvement of Natural Language Processing techniques, and especially with the recent growth of Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper investigates the challenge of identifying axioms: fundamental ontology components that define logical relations between classes and properties. In this work, we introduce an Ontology Axiom Benchmark OntoAxiom, and systematically test LLMs on that benchmark for axiom identification, evaluating different prompting strategies, ontologies, and axiom types. The benchmark consists of nine medium-sized ontologies with together 17.118 triples, and 2.771 axioms. We focus on subclass, disjoint, subproperty, domain, and range axioms. To evaluate LLM performance, we compare twelve LLMs with three shot settings and two prompting strategies: a Direct approach where we query all axioms at once, versus an Axiom-by-Axiom (AbA) approach, where each prompt queries for one axiom only. Our findings show that the AbA prompting leads to higher F1 scores than the direct approach. However, performance varies across axioms, suggesting that certain axioms are more challenging to identify. The domain also influences performance: the FOAF ontology achieves a score of 0.642 for the subclass axiom, while the music ontology reaches only 0.218. Larger LLMs outperform smaller ones, but smaller models may still be viable for resource-constrained settings. Although performance overall is not high enough to fully automate axiom identification, LLMs can provide valuable candidate axioms to support ontology engineers with the development and refinement of ontologies."}

Final doctoral thesis version containing modifications suggested by the referees: Marco G. Genoni, Madalin Guta, and Lukasz Cywinski", "summary": "Quantum entanglement, in the form of spin squeezing, is known to improve the sensitivity of atomic sensors to static or slowly varying fields. Sensing transient events presents a distinct challenge, requires different analysis tools, and has not been shown to benefit from entanglement in practically important scenarios such as spin-precession magnetometry. To address this, we apply concepts from continuous quantum measurements and estimation theory to optical atomic magnetometers, aiming to accurately model these devices, interpret their measurement data, control their dynamics, and achieve optimal sensitivity. Quantifying this optimal performance requires determining a fundamental quantum limit on sensitivity. We derive this limit, imposed by noise, and show that it scales at best linearly with sensing time and atom number N, ruling out any super-classical scaling. This limit is independent of the initial state, measurement, estimator, and measurement-based feedback, and depends only on the decoherence model and the strength of field fluctuations. Thus, finding an estimator that attains this bound proves the sensing strategy optimal. To approach this limit, we develop a quantum dynamical model scalable with N, based on a co-moving Gaussian approximation of the stochastic master equation, which includes measurement backaction and decoherence. This enables a real-time estimation and control architecture integrating an extended Kalman filter with a linear quadratic regulator. Simulating the magnetometer with our model and EKF+LQR strategy shows that quantum-limited tracking of constant and fluctuating fields is within reach of current atomic magnetometers. Our sensing strategy can also track biologically relevant signals, such as heartbeat-like waveforms, and drive the atomic ensemble into an entangled state, even when the measurement record is used for feedback but later discarded."}

However, evaluation of rendering aesthetics, a growing domain relevant to photographic editing, content creation, and AI-generated imagery, remains underexplored due to the lack of datasets that reflect the inherently subjective nature of style preference. In this work, a novel benchmark dataset designed to model human aesthetic judgments of image rendering styles is introduced: the Dataset for Evaluating the Aesthetics of Rendering (DEAR). Built upon the MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset, DEAR incorporates pairwise human preference scores collected via large-scale crowdsourcing, with each image pair evaluated by 25 distinct human evaluators with a total of 13,648 of them participating overall. These annotations capture nuanced, context-sensitive aesthetic preferences, enabling the development and evaluation of models that go beyond traditional distortion-based IQA, focusing on a new task: Evaluation of Aesthetics of Rendering (EAR). The data collection pipeline is described, human voting patterns are analyzed, and multiple use cases are outlined, including style preference prediction, aesthetic benchmarking, and personalized aesthetic modeling. To the best of the authors' knowledge, DEAR is the first dataset to systematically address image aesthetics of rendering assessment grounded in subjective human preferences.

We introduce MusWikiDB, a vector database of 3.2M passages from 144K music-related Wikipedia pages, and ArtistMus, a benchmark of 1,000 questions on 500 diverse artists with metadata such as genre, debut year, and topic. These resources enable systematic evaluation of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for MQA. Experiments show that RAG markedly improves factual accuracy; open-source models gain up to +56.8 percentage points (for example, Qwen3 8B improves from 35.0 to 91.8), approaching proprietary model performance. RAG-style fine-tuning further boosts both factual recall and contextual reasoning, improving results on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. MusWikiDB also yields approximately 6 percentage points higher accuracy and 40% faster retrieval than a general-purpose Wikipedia corpus.

However, existing methods often fail to adequately distinguish between PMS and WPMS, typically employing uniform update strategies for clause weights and overlooking critical structural differences between the two problem types. In this work, we present a novel clause weighting scheme that, for the first time, updates the clause weights of PMS and WPMS instances according to distinct conditions. This scheme also introduces a new initialization method, which better accommodates the unique characteristics of both instance types.

Promising transducers use a mechanical intermediary that couples to both fields via radiation pressure. Such electro-optomechanical devices have achieved high efficiencies, yet require resolved-sideband cavities, and generally compromise in scalability and noise performance. Here, we relax this constraint by extending the protocol of Navarathna et al. that transfers optical quantum information onto a mechanical resonator using a broadband, sideband-unresolved cavity and feedback. Combining this with parametric mechanical-to-microwave conversion, we show that continuous optical-to-microwave quantum state transfer is possible using measurement-based feedback, while all-optical coherent feedback enables bidirectional transfer. To assess the transfer, we introduce the quantum transfer witness $\\mathcal{W}_T$, which -- though similar to the input-referred added noise -- also identifies whether a channel is capable of both preserving Gaussian entanglement and outperforming classical transduction schemes. Finally, we show that quantum-compatible noise performance is within reach of current experimental capabilities. Our results unlock a new design space for electro-optomechanical transducers and strengthens their candidacy as scalable quantum links between distant nodes."}

This paper proposes Language Action-guided Reinforcement Learning (LA-RL) with Safety Guarantees, a novel framework that integrates the semantic reasoning of large language models (LLMs) into the actor-critic architecture with an improved safety layer. Within this framework, task-specific reward shaping harmonizes the dual objectives of maximizing driving efficiency and ensuring safety, guiding decision-making based on both environmental insights and clearly defined goals. To enhance safety, LA-RL incorporates a safety-critical planner that combines model predictive control (MPC) with discrete control barrier functions (DCBFs). This layer formally constrains the LLM-informed policy to a safe action set, employs a slack mechanism that enhances solution feasibility, prevents overly conservative behavior and allows for greater policy exploration without compromising safety. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it significantly outperforms several current state-of-the-art methods, offering a more adaptive, reliable, and robust solution for autonomous highway driving. Compared to existing SOTA, it achieves approximately 20$\\%$ higher success rate than the knowledge graph (KG) based baseline and about 30$\\%$ higher than the retrieval augmented generation (RAG) based baseline. In low-density environments, LA-RL achieves a 100$\\%$ success rate.

Starting from a microscopic Lagrangian for a relativistic electron beam coupled to a single radiation mode, we construct a Keldysh functional integral, perform the large-N rescaling, and integrate out the electronic degrees of freedom. This yields an effective action for the FEL mode in which dispersion, gain, and noise are all generated by a single electronic self-energy built from the current correlations of the beam. For a stationary Gaussian beam, we obtain closed analytic expressions for the retarded and Keldysh components of the self-energy, which directly encode frequency pulling, gain reduction due to energy spread, and the noise spectrum experienced by the field. At low frequency, the theory reduces to a Landau-Ginzburg-Keldysh description of a single complex mode with a mass, growth rate, nonlinearity, and noise strength fully determined by beam current, energy spread, and detuning. In this framework, the FEL threshold appears as a continuous non-equilibrium phase transition in the laser universality class: the coherent field amplitude plays the role of an order parameter, while the amplitude of critical fluctuations is fixed by the microscopic noise kernel. The result is a minimal open quantum field theory analog of Vlasov-Maxwell FEL theory, in which gain, dispersion, and noise arise from a unified self-energy framework rather than from separate phenomenological ingredients."}

A significant challenge in robotic assistance lies in surgical path planning, which often relies on the registration of intraoperative 2D images with preoperative 3D CT scans.

To address this issue, we introduce a differentiable rendering-based framework for 3D transpedicular path planning utilizing bi-planar 2D X-rays. Our method integrates differentiable rendering with a vertebral atlas generated through a Statistical Shape Model (SSM) and employs a learned similarity loss to refine the SSM shape and pose dynamically, independent of fixed imaging geometries. We evaluated our framework in two stages: first, through vertebral reconstruction from orthogonal X-rays for benchmarking, and second, via clinician-in-the-loop path planning using arbitrary-view X-rays. Our results indicate that our method outperformed a normalized cross-correlation baseline in reconstruction metrics (DICE: 0.75 vs. 0.65) and achieved comparable performance to the state-of-the-art model ReVerteR (DICE: 0.77), while maintaining generalization to arbitrary views. Success rates for bipedicular planning reached 82% with synthetic data and 75% with cadaver data, exceeding the 66% and 31% rates of a 2D-to-3D baseline, respectively.

We combine DPER with the state-of-the-art Twin Delayed DDPG algorithm and evaluate its performance across standard continuous control benchmarks.\n  Results: DPER outperforms conventional experience replay strategies such as vanilla experience replay and prioritized experience replay in multiple MuJoCo tasks from the OpenAI Gym suite.\n  Conclusions: Our findings show that decoupling experience replay for Actor and Critic networks can enhance training dynamics and final policy quality. DPER offers a generalizable mechanism that enhances performance for a wide class of actor-critic off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms."}

PL7 and PL5 exhibit notably stronger PDMR than PL6 as opposed to optical detection, indicating higher ionization efficiency and suitability for electrical readout. Rabi oscillation and two-frequency spectroscopy reveal a previously undiscovered secondary resonance of PL7. We determine the zero-field splitting parameters of PL7 and assign the recently reported PL3a defect to PL7. The demonstrated PDMR of these NIR defects constitutes a key advancement toward quantum electronic devices.

This paper addresses this challenge by introducing AionHMR, a comprehensive framework designed to bridge this domain gap. We propose an optimization-based method that extends a top-performing model by incorporating the SMPL-A body model, enabling the concurrent and accurate modeling of adults, children, and infants. Leveraging this approach, we generated pseudo-ground-truth annotations for publicly available child and infant image databases. Using these new training data, we then developed and trained a specialized transformer-based deep learning model capable of real-time 3D age-inclusive human reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods significantly improve shape and pose estimation for children and infants without compromising accuracy on adults. Importantly, our reconstructed meshes serve as privacy-preserving substitutes for raw images, retaining essential action, pose, and geometry information while enabling anonymized datasets release. As a demonstration, we introduce the 3D-BabyRobot dataset, a collection of action-preserving 3D reconstructions of children interacting with robots. This work bridges a crucial domain gap and establishes a foundation for inclusive, privacy-aware, and age-diverse 3D human modeling."}

The method is first demonstrated on a two-state benchmark, where it accurately recovers a prescribed safe region as the 1-level set of a polynomial Lyapunov function. We then describe the distinguishing characteristics of the studied vehicle-with-driver system: the control dynamics mimic human driver behavior through a delayed preview-tracking model that, with suitable parameter choices, can also emulate digital controllers. To enable SOS optimization, a polynomial approximation of the nonlinear vehicle model is derived, together with its operating-envelope constraints. The framework is then applied to understeering and oversteering scenarios, and the estimated safe sets are compared with reference boundaries obtained from exhaustive simulations. The results show that SOS techniques can efficiently deliver Lyapunov-defined safe regions, supporting their potential use for real-time safety assessment, for example as a supervisory layer for active vehicle control."}

Instrumented indentation can mimic such real-life damage events and induce flaws and cracking under controlled conditions. At the same time, instrumented indentation allows for systematic examination of the deformation and structural changes of the regions of the glass being indented. However, structural probing is nearly always performed after rather than during the sharp contact event, limiting our understanding of the indentation process. To overcome this, we here demonstrate the use of nanofocus X-ray scattering experiments to probe the local mechanical and structural response of vitreous silica during indentation. Two-dimensional mapping of the scattering pattern in the zone below a sharp diamond wedge indenter reveals local changes in the atomic structure and density as well as cracking behavior. These in situ experiments during indentation reveal the formation and evolution of the densification zone and cracking with nanoscale resolution. Understanding the interplay between structural densification and cracking behavior in glasses is deepened through this work, which is crucial for the development of more damage-resistant and thus stronger glasses as well as fundamental understanding of glass deformation mechanisms."}

In this paper, we test sensitivity and robustness of an artificial intelligence (AI) weather forecasting model: NVIDIAs FourCastNetv2 (FCNv2). We conduct two experiments designed to assess model output under different levels of injected noise in the models initial condition. First, we perturb the initial condition of Hurricane Florence from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset (September 13-16, 2018) with varying amounts of Gaussian noise and examine the impact on predicted trajectories and forecasted storm intensity. Second, we start FCNv2 with fully random initial conditions and observe how the model responds to nonsensical inputs. Our results indicate that FCNv2 accurately preserves hurricane features under low to moderate noise injection. Even under high levels of noise, the model maintains the general storm trajectory and structure, although positional accuracy begins to degrade. FCNv2 consistently underestimates storm intensity and persistence across all levels of injected noise. With full random initial conditions, the model generates smooth and cohesive forecasts after a few timesteps, implying the models tendency towards stable, smoothed outputs. Our approach is simple and portable to other data-driven AI weather forecasting models."}

Our work combines room-temperature randomized benchmarking with a new class of composite pulses that are simultaneously robust to frequency and amplitude, affecting random and systematic errors. We introduce Power-Unaffected, Doubly-Detuning-Insensitive Gates (PUDDINGs) -- a theoretical framework for constructing conditional gates with immunity to both amplitude and frequency errors. For single-qubit and two-qubit CNOT gate demonstrations in a solid-state nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, we systematically measure an improvement in the error per gate up to a factor of 9. By projecting the application of PUDDING to cryogenic temperatures we show a record two-qubit error per gate of $1.2 \\times 10^{-5}$, corresponding to a fidelity of $99.9988\\%$, far below the thresholds required by surface and color code error correction.

We introduce Correlation Aware Restoration with Diffusion (CARD), a training-free extension of DDRM that explicitly handles correlated Gaussian noise. CARD first whitens the noisy observation, which converts the noise into an i.i.d. form. Then, the diffusion restoration steps are replaced with noise-whitened updates, which inherits DDRM's closed-form sampling efficiency while now being able to handle correlated noise. To emphasize the importance of addressing correlated noise, we contribute CIN-D, a novel correlated noise dataset captured across diverse illumination conditions to evaluate restoration methods on real rolling-shutter sensor noise. This dataset fills a critical gap in the literature for experimental evaluation with real-world correlated noise. Experiments on standard benchmarks with synthetic correlated noise and on CIN-D demonstrate that CARD consistently outperforms existing methods across denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution tasks."}

While recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) show substantial specific skills for a wide array of downstream tasks, they more or less fall shorts in general intelligence. Following correlation between intelligence and system 2 reasoning (slow thinking), in this paper, we aim to answering a worthwhile research question: could machine intelligence such as LLMs be evolved to acquire reasoning ability (not specific skill) just like our human beings? To this end, we propose evolutionary reasoning optimization (ERO) framework which performs survival of the fittest over a population of LLMs to search for individual with strong reasoning ability. Given a reasoning task, ERO first initializes multiple LLMs as a population, after which an evolutionary strategy evolves the population to maximize quantified reasoning score of the best individual. Based on experiments on representative testsuites, we claim two surprising empirical discoveries: i) the latest LLMs such as GPT-5 still show limited system 2 reasoning ability; ii) with simple evolution-loop of ERO, a relatively weak model (Qwen-7B) could be enhanced to emerge powerful reasoning ability.

However, accurate task-specific trust evaluation of multi-hop collaborators can be extremely complex. The reason is that their trust evaluation is determined by a combination of diverse trust-related perspectives with different characteristics, including historical collaboration reliability, volatile and sensitive conditions of available resources for collaboration, as well as continuously evolving network topologies. To address this challenge, this paper presents a graph neural network (GNN)-aided distributed agentic AI (GADAI) framework, in which different aspects of devices' task-specific trustworthiness are separately evaluated and jointly integrated to facilitate multi-hop collaborator selection. GADAI first utilizes a GNN-assisted model to infer device trust from historical collaboration data. Specifically, it employs GNN to propagate and aggregate trust information among multi-hop neighbours, resulting in more accurate device reliability evaluation. Considering the dynamic and privacy-sensitive nature of device resources, a privacy-preserving resource evaluation mechanism is implemented using agentic AI. Each device hosts a large AI model-driven agent capable of autonomously determining whether its local resources meet the requirements of a given task, ensuring both task-specific and privacy-preserving trust evaluation. By combining the outcomes of these assessments, only the trusted devices can coordinate a task-oriented multi-hop cooperation path through their agents in a distributed manner. Experimental results show that our proposed GADAI outperforms the comparison algorithms in planning multi-hop paths that maximize the value of task completion."}

However, existing metrics for comparing optimization methods typically do not distinguish between these strategies, which often incur different communication costs in practice. To address this disparity, we introduce a simple and natural model of federated optimization that quantifies communication and local computation complexities. This new model allows for several commonly used client-selection strategies and explicitly associates each with a distinct cost. Within this setting, we propose a new algorithm that achieves the best-known communication and local complexities among existing federated optimization methods for non-convex optimization. This algorithm is based on the inexact composite gradient method with a carefully constructed gradient estimator and a special procedure for solving the auxiliary subproblem at each iteration. The gradient estimator is based on SAGA, a popular variance-reduced gradient estimator. We first derive a new variance bound for it, showing that SAGA can exploit functional similarity. We then introduce the Recursive-Gradient technique as a general way to potentially improve the error bound of a given conditionally unbiased gradient estimator, including both SAGA and SVRG. By applying this technique to SAGA, we obtain a new estimator, RG-SAGA, which has an improved error bound compared to the original one."}

Capturing their 4-dimensional structures, composition and spatio-temporal configuration in-the-wild, though extremely interesting, is equally hard. Therefore, existing works often focus on one object at a time, while relying on some category-specific parametric shape model for dynamic objects. This can lead to inconsistent scene configurations, in addition to being limited to the modeled object categories. We propose COM4D (Compositional 4D), a method that consistently and jointly predicts the structure and spatio-temporal configuration of 4D/3D objects using only static multi-object or dynamic single object supervision. We achieve this by a carefully designed training of spatial and temporal attentions on 2D video input. The training is disentangled into learning from object compositions on the one hand, and single object dynamics throughout the video on the other, thus completely avoiding reliance on 4D compositional training data. At inference time, our proposed attention mixing mechanism combines these independently learned attentions, without requiring any 4D composition examples. By alternating between spatial and temporal reasoning, COM4D reconstructs complete and persistent 4D scenes with multiple interacting objects directly from monocular videos. Furthermore, COM4D provides state-of-the-art results in existing separate problems of 4D object and composed 3D reconstruction despite being purely data-driven."}

Owing to computational and token-cost constraints, we evaluate a curated set of 100 representative problems across multiple large language models (LLMs), including GPT-OSS and LLaMA variants, under standard prompting, CoT, and ToT strategies. Our results show that CoT improves baseline accuracy from 78% (standard prompting) to 83% on average, while ToT further increases performance by up to 5 percentage points, achieving 88% accuracy with GPT-OSS-120B. These improvements highlight that ToT is particularly effective in medium-to-large-scale models but may offer less advantage for smaller ones.

Pattern repositories are the necessary System-1 substrate; the missing component is a System-2 coordination layer that selects, constrains, and binds these patterns. We formalize this layer via UCCT, a theory of semantic anchoring that models reasoning as a phase transition governed by effective support (rho_d), representational mismatch (d_r), and an adaptive anchoring budget (gamma log k). Under this lens, ungrounded generation is simply an unbaited retrieval of the substrate's maximum likelihood prior, while \"reasoning\" emerges when anchors shift the posterior toward goal-directed constraints. We translate UCCT into architecture with MACI, a coordination stack that implements baiting (behavior-modulated debate), filtering (Socratic judging), and persistence (transactional memory). By reframing common objections as testable coordination failures, we argue that the path to AGI runs through LLMs, not around them."}

We address this by optimizing the behavior model that controls individual traffic participants. To improve efficiency, we adopt an instance-centric scene representation, where each traffic participant and map element is modeled in its own local coordinate frame. This design enables efficient, viewpoint-invariant scene encoding and allows static map tokens to be reused across simulation steps. To model interactions, we employ a query-centric symmetric context encoder with relative positional encodings between local frames. We use Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning to learn the behavior model and propose an adaptive reward transformation that automatically balances robustness and realism during training. Experiments demonstrate that our approach scales efficiently with the number of tokens, significantly reducing training and inference times, while outperforming several agent-centric baselines in terms of positional accuracy and robustness."}

A state-feedback controller is developed by the {nonovershooting backstepping} method to simultaneously achieve exponential output regulation and enforce safety constraints on the system output, which is the state furthest from the control input. To handle unmeasured PDE states and external disturbances, a state observer and a disturbance estimator are designed. Explicit bounds on the estimation errors are derived and used to construct a robust safe regulator that accounts for the uncertainties. The proposed control scheme guarantees that: 1) If the system output is initially within the safe region, it remains there; otherwise, it will be rescued to the safety within a prescribed time; 2) The output tracking error converges to zero exponentially; 3) The observer accurately estimates both the distributed states and external disturbances, with estimation errors converging to zero exponentially; 4) All signals in the closed-loop system remain bounded. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a UAV delivery scenario with a cable-suspended payload, where the payload is regulated to track a desired reference while avoiding collisions with barriers."}

The polarization change varies with the angle between the polarization of pump and probe light, but is found to be independent of their orientation relative to the crystal axes. This behavior differs between the reflected and transmitted beams, and can be modeled by taking into account a birefringence induced by the electric field of the pump. These polarization-change effects can be very strong, with polarization rotation exceeding 90°, at pump intensities well below the damage threshold. We also observe a markedly different behavior of the reflected beam depending on whether the material is crystalline or amorphous."}

Prior work has introduced datasets and benchmarks aimed at improving temporal reasoning, but these have emphasized other video content, including sports, cooking, and movies. No existing benchmark focuses exclusively on the unique challenges of temporal understanding in ego-centric AD footage. To fill this gap, the Temporal Understanding in Autonomous Driving (TAD) benchmark is presented, which evaluates VLMs' ability to capture the dynamic relationships between actions in AD. TAD comprises nearly 6,000 question-answer (QA) pairs, spanning 7 human-designed tasks. In addition, an evaluation is performed that consists of 9 closed- and open-source generalist models as well as SoTA AD specialist models. When applied to TAD, current SoTA models demonstrated substandard accuracies, largely due to imperfect fine-grained motion understanding. To improve motion understanding and overall accuracy on TAD, two novel training-free solutions are proposed: Scene-CoT, that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and TCogMap, which incorporates an ego-centric temporal cognitive map. The proposed approaches are integrated with existing VLMs and improve average accuracy on TAD by up to 17.72%. By introducing TAD, benchmarking multiple SoTA models, and proposing effective enhancements, this work aims to catalyze future research on temporal understanding in AD.

The proposed framework formulates an optimization problem that takes a construction mission divided into sub-tasks and a team of autonomous UAVs, along with limited volume and battery. It generates an optimal mission plan comprising task assignments and scheduling while accounting for task dependencies arising from the geometric and structural requirements of the 3D design, inter-UAV safety constraints, material usage, and total flight time of each UAV. The potential conflicts occurring during the simultaneous operation of the UAVs are addressed at a segment level by dynamically selecting the starting time and location of each task to guarantee collision-free parallel execution. An importance prioritization is proposed to accelerate the computation by guiding the solution toward more important tasks. Additionally, a utility maximization formulation is proposed to dynamically determine the optimal number of UAVs required for a given mission, balancing the trade-off between minimizing makespan and the deployment of excess agents. The proposed framework's effectiveness is evaluated through a Gazebo-based simulation setup, where agents are coordinated by a mission control module allocating the printing tasks based on the generated optimal scheduling plan while remaining within the material and battery constraints of each UAV."}

In halide perovskites, however, the role of confinement in governing symmetry effects on vibrational modes has remained unresolved. Here we synthesize 2D CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets with atomically defined thicknesses for 2-5 monolayers (MLs) and perform exciton absorption and emission analysis, crystalline phase determination, and phonon analysis. The lowest dimensional structure (2 MLs) reveal a co-existence of cubic and orthorhombic structure, energetically converging to orthorhombic for 3 MLs and beyond. Through polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy and first-principles theory for 2-5 MLs, a striking symmetry contrast is found: B1g modes intensify and evolve in line with the phonon-confinement model, while Ag modes deviate, reflecting their distinct spatial localization. First principles calculations show that B1g vibrational modes largely reside in the xy-plane, Pb-Br-Pb units connect octahedra along the xy-direction with increased lattice dynamics as inner layers accumulate, whereas A1g vibrations couple to out-of-plane distortions and remain susceptible to surface disorder and finite-size effects. This symmetry-driven dichotomy provides a general framework for understanding phonon localization in layered halide perovskites. Beyond mechanism, we establish Raman fingerprints, particularly the A1g/B1g intensity ratio in cross-polarized geometry, as a calibrated, non-destructive metrology for 2D nanoplatelet thickness through 2-5 MLs. These results bridge electronic and phonon confinement and highlight symmetry engineering as a route to understand and control phonons, excitons, and their interactions in low-dimensional optoelectronic materials."}

While Shapley value based methods provide principled feature attributions, existing formulations cannot tractably evaluate higher order interactions: the Shapley Taylor Interaction Index (STII) requires exponential scale enumeration of subsets, and current tensor based approaches such as the Marginal SHAP Tensor (MST) are restricted to first order effects. The central problem is that no existing framework simultaneously preserves the axiomatic exactness of STII and avoids the exponential computational blow up inherent to high order discrete derivatives. Here we show that high order Shapley interactions can be represented exactly as tensor network contractions, enabling polynomial time and polylog depth computation under Tensor Train (TT) structure. We introduce Interaction Tensor SHAP (IT SHAP), which reformulates STII as the contraction of a Value Tensor and a Weight Tensor, and assume a finite state TT representation of the Weight Tensor with polynomial TT ranks. Under TT structured model and distribution tensors, we show that IT SHAP reduces the exponential complex Theta(4^n) of STII to NC2 parallel time. These results demonstrate that IT SHAP provides a unified, axiomatic, and computationally tractable formulation of main effects and higher order interactions in high dimensional models. This framework establishes a foundation for scalable interaction aware explainable AI, with implications for large black box models whose combinatorial structure has previously rendered interaction analysis infeasible."}

Due to the intrinsic absence of inversion symmetry, 2D ferroelectrics exhibit bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE), which relies on hot, non-thermalized photo-excited carriers to generate a photo-induced current with enhanced performances thanks to efficient charge separation mechanisms. The absence of a required p-n junction architecture makes these materials particularly attractive for nanoscale energy harvesting. Recent studies have reported enhanced BPVE in nanometer-thick CuInP$_2$S$_6$ ferroelectric embedded between two graphene wafers, driven by relatively strong polarization and reduced dimensionality. Short circuit photocurrent density values have been observed to reach up to mA/cm$^2$. In this paper, we demonstrate that the shift-current mechanism alone cannot fully account for these high conductivity values, suggesting that additional mechanisms may play a significant role.

However, conventional sampling schemes often require a large number of samples to achieve sufficient accuracy. In this work we propose the concentrated Monte Carlo sampling approach, which builds on the idea that in systems with only short range correlations, to obtain accurate expectation values for local observables, one would favor detailed information in the surroundings of this observable compared to far away from it. In this approach we consider all possible configurations in the surroundings of a local observable, and unique samples from the remaining of the setup drawn using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We have tested the performance of this approach for ground states of the spin-1/2 tilted Ising model in different phases, and also for thermal states in the a spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model. Our results demonstrate that CMCS yields higher accuracy for local observables in short-range correlated states while requiring substantially fewer samples, showcasing in which regimes one can obtain acceleration for the evaluation of expectation values."}

A promising alternative, latent visual reasoning, circumvents this bottleneck yet currently forces a critical trade-off: methods either sacrifice precise perceptual modeling by over-compressing features or fail to model dynamic problems due to static, non-interleaved structures. We introduce Interleaved Latent Visual Reasoning (ILVR), a framework that unifies dynamic state evolution with precise perceptual modeling. ILVR interleaves textual generation with latent visual representations that act as specific, evolving cues for subsequent reasoning. To enable this, we employ a self-supervision strategy where a Momentum Teacher Model selectively distills relevant features from helper images into sparse supervision targets. This adaptive selection mechanism guides the model to autonomously generate context-aware visual signals. Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ILVR significantly outperforms existing approaches, effectively bridging the gap between fine-grained perception and sequential multimodal reasoning."}

Peer-reviewed publications form the foundation upon which new research and knowledge are built. Errors that persist in the literature can propagate unnoticed, creating confusion in follow-up studies and complicating reproducibility. The accelerating pace of research and the increasing demands on the peer-review system make such mistakes harder to detect and avoid. To address this, we developed a Paper Correctness Checker based on GPT-5 to systematically identify mistakes in papers previously published at top AI conferences and journals. Our analysis focuses on objective mistakes-e.g., errors in formulas, derivations, calculations, figures, and tables-that have a clearly verifiable ground truth. We intentionally exclude subjective considerations such as novelty, importance, or writing quality. We find that published papers contain a non-negligible number of objective mistakes and that the average number of mistakes per paper has increased over time-from 3.8 in NeurIPS 2021 to 5.9 in NeurIPS 2025 (55.3% increase); from 4.1 in ICLR 2018 to 5.2 in ICLR 2025; and from 5.0 in TMLR 2022/23 to 5.5 in TMLR 2025. Human experts reviewed 316 potential mistakes identified by the AI Checker and confirmed that 263 were actual mistakes, corresponding to a precision of 83.2%. While most identified issues are relatively minor, correcting them would reduce confusion in the literature and strengthen reproducibility. The AI Checker also surfaced potentially more substantive mistakes that could affect the interpretation of results. Moreover, we show that the AI Checker can propose correct fixes for 75.8% of the identified mistakes. Overall, this study highlights the potential of frontier LLMs to detect and correct objective mistakes in published papers, helping to establish a firmer foundation of knowledge."}

To robustly ground this correspondence-oriented task representation into actions, we design a conditional policy with a spatio-temporal attention mechanism that effectively fuses information across multiple input modalities.

The discrete-time dynamic evolution of each cognitive state is modeled using a first-order affine difference equation. Reliance is defined as a single discrete-valued state, whose evolution at each time step depends on the cognitive states satisfying certain threshold conditions. Using data collected from 16 participants, we estimate participant-specific model parameters based on their reliance on the automation and intermittently self-reported cognitive states during a continuous drive in a vehicle simulator. The model can be estimated using a single user's trajectory data (e.g. 8 minutes of driving), making it suitable for online parameter adaptation methods. Our results show that the model fits the observed trajectories well for several participants, with their reliance behavior primarily influenced by trust, perceived risk, or both. Importantly, the model is interpretable, such that the variations in model parameters across participants provide insights into differences in the time scales over which cognitive states evolve, and how these states are influenced by task complexity. Implications on the design of human-centric vehicle automation design are discussed."}

However, transforming the resulting high-dimensional data into interpretable deformation pattern maps remains a resource-intensive and largely manual process. In this work, we introduce a data-driven workflow that automates this interpretation step using unsupervised and supervised learning. Grain-orientation-colored computational tomograph pictures obtained from CuNi alloy simulations were first compressed through an autoencoder to a 32-dimensional global feature vector. Despite this strong compression, the reconstructed images retained the essential microstructural motifs: grain boundaries, stacking faults, twins, and partial lattice rotations, while omitting only the finest defects. The learned representations were then combined with simulation metadata (composition, load, time, temperature, and spatial position) to train a CNN-MLP model to predict the dominant deformation pattern. The resulting model achieves a prediction accuracy of approximately 96% on validation data. A refined evaluation strategy, in which an entire spatial region containing distinct grains was excluded from training, provides a more robust measure of generalization. The approach demonstrates that essential tribological deformation signatures can be automatically identified and classified from structural images using Machine Learning. This proof of concept constitutes a first step towards fully automated, data-driven construction of tribological mechanism maps and, ultimately, toward predictive modeling frameworks that may reduce the need for large-scale MD simulation campaigns."}

Our method combines (i) a syntax-preserving unlearning strategy that safeguards the structural integrity of hardware code during forgetting, and (ii) a fine-grained floor-aware selective loss that enables precise and efficient removal of problematic knowledge. This integration achieves effective unlearning without degrading LLM code generation capabilities. Extensive experiments show that our framework supports forget sets up to 3x larger, typically requiring only a single training epoch, while preserving both syntactic correctness and functional integrity of register-transfer level (RTL) codes.

We show that all non-adaptive shadow tomography algorithms must incur an error of $\\varepsilon=\\tildeΩ(γ\\min\\{\\sqrt{M}, \\sqrt{d}\\})$ for some choice of observables, even with unlimited copies. Unfortunately, the classical shadows algorithm by [HKP20] and naive algorithms that directly measure each observable suffer even more. We design an algorithm that achieves an error of $\\varepsilon=\\tilde{O}(γ\\max_{i\\in[M]}\\|O_i\\|_{HS})$, which nearly matches our worst-case error lower bound for $M\\ge d$ and guarantees better accuracy when the observables have stronger structure. Remarkably, the algorithm only needs $n=\\frac{1}{γ^2}\\log(M/δ)$ copies to achieve that error with probability at least $1-δ$, matching the sample complexity of the classical shadows algorithm that achieves the same error without corrupted measurement outcomes. Our algorithm is conceptually simple and easy to implement. Classical simulation for fidelity estimation shows that our algorithm enjoys much stronger robustness than [HKP20] under adversarial noise. Finally, based on a reduction from full-state tomography to shadow tomography, we prove that for rank $r$ states, both the near-optimal asymptotic error of $\\varepsilon=\\tilde{O}(γ\\sqrt{r})$ and copy complexity $\\tilde{O}(dr^2/\\varepsilon^2)=\\tilde{O}(dr/γ^2)$ can be achieved for adversarially robust state tomography, closing the large gap in [ABCL25] where optimal error can only be achieved using pseudo-polynomial number of copies in $d$."}

Accepted by AAAI 2026. Extended version", "summary": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning has emerged as a promising paradigm in RGB-T tracking, enabling downstream task adaptation by freezing pretrained parameters and fine-tuning only a small set of parameters. This set forms a rank space made up of multiple individual ranks, whose expressiveness directly shapes the model's adaptability. However, quantitative analysis reveals low-rank adaptation exhibits significant redundancy in the rank space, with many ranks contributing almost no practical information. This hinders the model's ability to learn more diverse knowledge to address the various challenges in RGB-T tracking. To address this issue, we propose the Group Orthogonal Low-Rank Adaptation (GOLA) framework for RGB-T tracking, which effectively leverages the rank space through structured parameter learning. Specifically, we adopt a rank decomposition partitioning strategy utilizing singular value decomposition to quantify rank importance, freeze crucial ranks to preserve the pretrained priors, and cluster the redundant ranks into groups to prepare for subsequent orthogonal constraints. We further design an inter-group orthogonal constraint strategy. This constraint enforces orthogonality between rank groups, compelling them to learn complementary features that target diverse challenges, thereby alleviating information redundancy. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLA effectively reduces parameter redundancy and enhances feature representation capabilities, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets and validating its effectiveness in RGB-T tracking tasks."}

To address these limitations, we introduce PRiSM, a synthetic, fully dynamic, and multimodal benchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning via grounded Python code. PRiSM includes over 24,750 university-level physics and math problems, and it leverages our scalable agent-based pipeline, PrismAgent, to generate well-structured problem instances.

The dynamic nature and Python-powered automated ground truth generation of our benchmark allow for fine-grained experimental auditing of multimodal VLMs, revealing failure modes, uncertainty behaviors, and limitations in scientific reasoning. To this end, we propose five targeted evaluation tasks covering generalization, symbolic program synthesis, perturbation robustness, reasoning correction, and ambiguity resolution.

To overcome this, we present SIMPACT, a test-time, SIMulation-enabled ACTion Planning framework that equips VLMs with physical reasoning through simulation-in-the-loop world modeling, without requiring any additional training. From a single RGB-D observation, SIMPACT efficiently constructs physics simulations, enabling the VLM to propose informed actions, observe simulated rollouts, and iteratively refine its reasoning. By integrating language reasoning with physics prediction, our simulation-enabled VLM can understand contact dynamics and action outcomes in a physically grounded way. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on five challenging, real-world rigid-body and deformable manipulation tasks that require fine-grained physical reasoning, outperforming existing general-purpose robotic manipulation models.

The origin of this synthesizability and anomalous stability has remained elusive. Here, we resolve this paradox by establishing a comprehensive time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagram, constructed from a computational temperature-size phase diagram and experimental high-time-resolution isothermal measurements. Our density functional theory calculations reveal that at the nanoscale, the $α$-phase is stabilized by its low surface energy, which drastically lowers the nucleation barrier across a wide temperature range.

Here, we relax this constraint by extending the protocol of Navarathna et al. that transfers optical quantum information onto a mechanical resonator using a broadband, sideband-unresolved cavity and feedback. Combining this with parametric mechanical-to-microwave conversion, we show that continuous optical-to-microwave quantum state transfer is possible using measurement-based feedback, while all-optical coherent feedback enables bidirectional transfer. To assess the transfer, we introduce the quantum transfer witness $\\mathcal{W}_T$, which -- though similar to the input-referred added noise -- also identifies whether a channel is capable of both preserving Gaussian entanglement and outperforming classical transduction schemes. Finally, we show that quantum-compatible noise performance is within reach of current experimental capabilities.

However, this inpainting method introduces computational overhead that increases inference latency. In this work, we propose a simple alternative: simulating inference delay at training time and conditioning on action prefixes directly, eliminating any inference-time overhead. Our method requires no modifications to the model architecture or robot runtime, and can be implemented with only a few additional lines of code. In simulated experiments, we find that training-time RTC outperforms inference-time RTC at higher inference delays. In real-world experiments on box building and espresso making tasks with the $π_{0.6}$ VLA, we demonstrate that training-time RTC maintains both task performance and speed parity with inference-time RTC while being computationally cheaper. Our results suggest that training-time action conditioning is a practical drop-in replacement for inference-time inpainting in real-time robot control."}

This structure implies that the configuration-tracking error evolves exactly linearly in the associated Lie algebra coordinates (log-linear dynamics), rather than arising from a local linearization of the nonlinear system. As a result, a broad class of linear analysis and synthesis tools becomes directly applicable to powered spacecraft motion on SE2(3). A simple numerical example confirms that the error predicted by the linear Lie-algebra dynamics matches the error computed from the full nonlinear system, illustrating the exact log-linear behavior. This foundational property opens a path toward rigorous tools for satellite docking, autonomous rendezvous and proximity operations, robust controller design, and convex safety certification-capabilities that are difficult to achieve with classical local linearizations such as Tschauner-Hempel/Yamanaka-Ankersen (TH/YA)."}

On the one hand, it poses critical constraints to the compositional space that allows reliable design of absorbers for perovskite photovoltaics. On the other hand, it holds potential for the development of novel optoionic devices where an ionic response is triggered via optical stimuli. Funda-mental questions about the origin of such photo de-mixing process remain unanswered, both in terms of its mechanism as well as thermodynamic description. Here, we relate in-situ measurements of ionic and electronic transport of mixed bromide-iodide perovskite thin films performed during photo de-mixing with the evolution of their optical and morpho-logical properties. The results point to the definition of different stages of the de-mixing process which, based on micros-copy and spectroscopic measurements, we assign to regimes of spinodal decomposition and nucleation of quasi-equilibrium iodide- and bromide-rich phases. Combined with density functional theory calculations, we explore the role of dimensionality in the mechanism and reversibility of photo de-mixing and dark re-mixing processes, referring to elec-tronic and ionic contributions to the de-mixing driving force. Additionally, our data emphasizes the role of the surface, as significantly different de-mixing dynamics, in terms of extent and reversibility, are observed for films with or without encapsulation.

Although high-dimensional text can encode rich contextual information, it also poses unique challenges for causal identification and estimation. In particular, the positivity assumption, which requires sufficient treatment overlap across confounder values, is often violated at the observational level, when massive text is represented in feature spaces. Redundant or spurious textual features inflate dimensionality, producing extreme propensity scores, unstable weights, and inflated variance in effect estimates. We address these challenges with Confounding-Aware Token Rationalization (CATR), a framework that selects a sparse necessary subset of tokens using a residual-independence diagnostic designed to preserve confounding information sufficient for unconfoundedness. By discarding irrelevant texts while retaining key signals, CATR mitigates observational-level positivity violations and stabilizes downstream causal effect estimators. Experiments on synthetic data and a real-world study using the MIMIC-III database demonstrate that CATR yields more accurate, stable, and interpretable causal effect estimates than existing baselines."}

In this paper, we propose an improved attention-based pruning framework, termed ShaRP, that integrates segment-aware causal masking, positional debiasing, and token deduplication for enhanced token selection. It enables effective pruning at shallow layers while maintaining stable performance under high compression rates without retraining.

This fused metric is demonstrated to correlate more strongly with human judgements across all tested domains for faithfulness. Improving the ability to evaluate the faithfulness of LLMs, allows for greater confidence to be placed within models, allowing for their implementation in a greater diversity of scenarios.

Traditional empirical and thermodynamic approaches often fail to capture the complex, nonlinear factors governing vitrification. In this study, we applied two ensemble machine learning algorithms-Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)-to the glass_ternary_hipt dataset to predict the GFA of ternary oxide glasses directly from composition-derived descriptors. Both models achieved excellent predictive accuracy (R^2 > 0.92, MAE < 0.04), confirming that GFA is learnable from compositional features alone. Feature importance analysis revealed that electronegativity variance, atomic size mismatch, and valence electron descriptors are the most influential factors, while cohesive energy and ionic radius provided secondary contributions. These chemically interpretable features align with established theories of glass formation, thereby bridging predictive performance with physical understanding. The novelty of this work lies in systematically extending ML-based predictive modeling to ternary oxide glasses, a class less studied compared to metallic and binary systems. Our results demonstrate that ensemble learning not only enables accurate GFA prediction but also provides actionable insights for designing new glass compositions with enhanced stability."}

A common solution is applying downscaling methods, which include dynamical downscaling and statistical downscaling, to the outputs of global models. This work focuses on statistical downscaling, which establishes statistical relationships between low-resolution and high-resolution historical data using statistical models. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for this task, giving rise to various high-performance super-resolution models, which can be directly applied for downscaling, such as diffusion models and Generative Adversarial Networks. This work relies on a diffusion-based downscaling framework named CorrDiff. In contrast to the original work of CorrDiff, the region considered in this work is nearly 20 times larger, and we not only consider surface variables as in the original work, but also encounter high-level variables (six pressure levels) as target downscaling variables. In addition, a global residual connection is added to improve accuracy. In order to generate the 3km forecasts for the China region, we apply our trained models to the 25km global grid forecasts of CMA-GFS, an operational global model of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), and SFF, a data-driven deep learning-based weather model developed from Spherical Fourier Neural Operators (SFNO). CMA-MESO, a high-resolution regional model, is chosen as the baseline model. The experimental results demonstrate that the forecasts downscaled by our method generally outperform the direct forecasts of CMA-MESO in terms of MAE for the target variables. Our forecasts of radar composite reflectivity show that CorrDiff, as a generative model, can generate fine-scale details that lead to more realistic predictions compared to the corresponding deterministic regression models."}

Here we propose a method to address this issue by employing a classical photodiode to compensate for the laser frequency difference. As an application of this method, we implement this technique in a mode-pairing QKD system, achieving an error rate approaching the theoretical limit and surpassing the linear key-rate bound over a fiber distance of 296.8 km.

In this work, we revisit the WSI-language modeling paradigm and show that tile-level features exhibit strong global and local redundancy, whereas only a small subset of tiles are truly task-relevant. Motivated by this observation, we introduce an efficient MLLM framework, called LoC-Path, that replaces the expensive slide-level encoder with redundancy-reducing modules. We first design a Sparse Token Merger (STM) and an MAE-pretrained resampler to remove local redundancy and compress globally redundant tile tokens into a compact slide-level representation set. We then propose a Cross-Attention Routing Adapter (CARA) and a Token Importance Scorer (TIS) to integrate the compressed visual representation with the language model in a computation-efficient manner.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of CICLe across diverse NLP classification benchmarks.

Based on first-principles calculations, we study the interplay of magnetic proximity and moiré proximity in WSe2/WSe2/CrI3 trilayers with different stackings and twist angles. Large valley splitting is observed due to redistribution of the exciton charge density across layers via a super-exchange-like mechanism, and its electric-field dependence bears similarity to electrically tunable and valley-selective Feshbach resonances. The valley splitting can be magnified in moiré superlattices owing to the superposition of Umklapp excitons folded from moiré minibands, yielding spatially modulated and enhanced magnetic proximity. The moiré proximity effect is demonstrated via an imprinted moiré potential on CrI3 layer and its feedback to the direct moiré potential on WSe2 bilayers is observed.

The style reward is derived from a fine-tuned sentence transformer using authorship verification (AV) signals, combined with content and completeness scores to stabilize long-form narrative generation. We conduct experiments using fiction by Mark Twain, a prominent 19th-century American author, with The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn serving as the reference style exemplar. Our 8B model outperforms larger baselines such as GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 4 in AV-style metrics, achieving a style score of 0.628 and competitive content quality.

In this work, we propose a novel and easy-to-implement strategy to separate the point cloud into annotatable regions. In our approach, we utilize a 2D grid to subdivide the point cloud into columns.

Semantic shifts are quantified using GloVe-based sentence embeddings, while sentiment is measured through lexicon-based analysis. We find that semantic similarity between pre- and post-interruption speech remains consistently high, suggesting that interruptions do not substantially alter argumentative content. However, interruptions directed at female advocates contain significantly higher levels of negative sentiment.

In this context, computational and machine learning driven catalyst discovery has emerged as a major research focus. These approaches frequently use the thermodynamic overpotential, calculated from adsorption free energies of reaction intermediates, as a key parameter in their analysis. In this paper, we explore the large-scale applicability of such overpotential estimates for identifying good catalyst candidates by using datasets from the Open Catalyst Project (OC20 and OC22). We start by quantifying the uncertainty in predicting adsorption energies using \\textit{ab initio} methods and find that $\\sim$0.3-0.5 eV is a conservative estimate for a single adsorption energy prediction. We then compute the overpotential of all materials in the OC20 and OC22 datasets for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. We find that while the overpotential allows the identification of known good catalysts such as platinum and iridium oxides, the uncertainty is large enough to misclassify a broad fraction of the datasets as ``good'', which limits its value as a screening criterion. These results question the reliance on overpotential estimation as a primary evaluation metric to sort through catalyst candidates and calls for a shift in focus in the computational catalysis and machine learning communities towards other metrics such as synthesizability, stability, lifetime or affordability."}

However, when quantum information is encoded in bosonic systems, this connection becomes subtler: as negativity is only a necessary property for potential quantum advantage, encoding (i.e., physical) states may exhibit large negativities while still corresponding to architectures that remain classically simulable. Several frameworks have attempted to relate non-negativity of states and gates in the computational phase space to non-negativity of processes in the physical bosonic phase space, but a consistent correspondence remains elusive.

However, state-of-the-art video models lack the ability to assess and express their confidence, impeding hallucination mitigation. To rigorously address this challenge, we propose C3, an uncertainty quantification (UQ) method for training continuous-scale calibrated controllable video models for dense confidence estimation at the subpatch level, precisely localizing the uncertainty in each generated video frame. Our UQ method introduces three core innovations to empower video models to estimate their uncertainty. First, our method develops a novel framework that trains video models for correctness and calibration via strictly proper scoring rules. Second, we estimate the video model's uncertainty in latent space, avoiding training instability and prohibitive training costs associated with pixel-space approaches. Third, we map the dense latent-space uncertainty to interpretable pixel-level uncertainty in the RGB space for intuitive visualization, providing high-resolution uncertainty heatmaps that identify untrustworthy regions. Through extensive experiments on large-scale robot learning datasets (Bridge and DROID) and real-world evaluations, we demonstrate that our method not only provides calibrated uncertainty estimates within the training distribution, but also enables effective out-of-distribution detection."}

We investigate sensor placement strategies and design a complete signal processing pipeline, including range bin selection, phase extraction, and frequency-domain estimation tailored to rodent vital signs. The system achieves 3 cm and 0.1 m/s sensitivity for motion and activity detection, while allowing discrimination of micro-movements associated with cardiopulmonary activity with a 2 um distance resolution. Experimental validation with two rodents in realistic in-vivo cages demonstrates that the radar can track animal position and extract respiration rates with 2 bpm accuracy. By minimizing stress and disturbance, this work improves both animal welfare and the reliability of physiological measurements, offering a refined alternative to traditional monitoring methods. This work represents the first demonstration of continuous radar-based vital sign monitoring in freely moving rodents within group-housed cages. The proposed approach lays the foundation for scalable, automated, and ethical monitoring solutions in preclinical and translational research."}

We propose Triplet-GCN, a single-branch graph convolutional model that represents each encounter as patient-feature-value triplets, constructs a bipartite EHR graph, and learns patient embeddings via a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) followed by a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP). The pipeline applies type-specific preprocessing -- median imputation and standardization for numeric variables, effect coding for binary features, and mode imputation with low-dimensional embeddings for rare categorical attributes -- and initializes patient nodes with summary statistics, while retaining measurement values on edges to preserve \"who measured what and by how much\". In a retrospective, multi-center Chinese cohort (N = 648; 70/30 train-test split) drawn from three tertiary hospitals, Triplet-GCN consistently outperforms strong tabular baselines (KNN, SVM, XGBoost, Random Forest) across discrimination and balanced error metrics, yielding a more favorable sensitivity-specificity trade-off and improved overall utility for early warning. These findings indicate that encoding EHR as triplets and propagating information over a patient-feature graph produce more informative patient representations than feature-independent models, offering a simple, end-to-end blueprint for deployable sepsis risk stratification."}

Surprisingly, we show that the tendency toward a collective spin description need not imply collective spin phenomena; rather, it can be exploited to generate new forms of strongly correlated quantum matter. The key idea is to use uniform cavity-mediated interactions to energetically project the system into the total-spin singlet sector ($S=0$) - a highly entangled subspace where the physics is governed entirely by cavity fluctuations. Focusing on Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a single-mode cavity, we show that global cavity fluctuations can effectively squeeze classical antiferromagnets into quantum spin liquids, characterized by non-local entanglement, fractionalized excitations, and emergent gauge fields. This work suggests that cavity QED can be a surprising resource for inducing strongly correlated phenomena, which could be explored in the new generation of hybrid tweezer-cavity platforms."}

Existing studies consider maintaining similar error across different resolutions as indicative of successful multi-resolution generalization. However, deep learning models serving as alternatives to numerical solvers should reduce error as resolution increases. The fundamental limitation is, the upper bound of physical law frequencies that low-resolution data can represent is constrained by its Nyquist frequency, making it difficult for models to process signals containing unseen frequency components during high-resolution inference. This results in errors being anchored at low resolution, incorrectly interpreted as successful generalization. We define this fundamental phenomenon as a new problem distinct from existing issues: Scale Anchoring. Therefore, we propose architecture-agnostic Frequency Representation Learning. It alleviates Scale Anchoring through resolution-aligned frequency representations and spectral consistency training: on grids with higher Nyquist frequencies, the frequency response in high-frequency bands of FRL-enhanced variants is more stable. This allows errors to decrease with resolution and significantly outperform baselines within our task and resolution range, while incurring only modest computational overhead."}

To begin with, predicted trajectories from the trained predictor and their ground truth are projected onto the map-derived reference routes within the Frenet coordinate system. We then employ CopulaCPTS as the conformal calibration method to generate temporal prediction intervals for distinct scenarios as the uncertainty measure. Building upon this, within the proposed trajectory reliability discriminator (TRD), mean error and calibrated confidence intervals are synergistically analyzed to establish reliability models for different scenarios. Subsequently, the risk-aware discriminator leverages a joint risk model that integrates longitudinal and lateral prediction intervals within the Frenet coordinate to identify critical points. This enables segmentation of trajectories into reliable and unreliable segments, holding the advantage of informing downstream planning modules with actionable reliability results. We evaluated our framework using the real-world nuPlan dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in scenario-aware uncertainty quantification and reliability assessment across diverse driving contexts."}

Existing randomness analysis lacks rigorous adversarial models and a clear characterization of the role of quantum coherence in these systems. In this work, we develop a comprehensive quantum information-theoretic framework for randomness generation in spontaneous emission processes. We characterize two distinct eavesdropping strategies: one where the adversary directly accesses the atom ensemble, and the other where the adversary accesses only its purification. Our analysis reveals that when randomness is generated through single-photon detection and temporal mode measurements, the QRNG is vulnerable to the first adversary scenario, though it still guarantees a lower bound on intrinsic randomness against the second adversary scenario even under maximal information leakage from the atoms. In contrast, QRNGs based on spatial mode detection and phase fluctuations demonstrate security against both types of adversaries, providing robust randomness generation. Furthermore, we provide a quantitative calculation of intrinsic randomness for these spontaneous-emission-based QRNG schemes."}

This method is specifically tailored to enhance the moving object detection system that we have developed and used previously. The current method introduces two innovations. This first one is a multi-input architecture that processes multiple stacked images simultaneously. The second is the incorporation of the convolutional block attention module which enables the model to focus on essential features in both spatial and channel dimensions. These advancements facilitate efficient learning from multiple inputs, leading to more robust detection of moving objects. The performance of the model is evaluated on a dataset consisting of approximately 2,000 observational images. We achieved an accuracy of nearly 99% with AUC (an Area Under the Curve) of >0.99.

With advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and the widespread availability of electrocardiography (ECG), AI-ECG offers a promising alternative for CAD screening. In this study, we developed an interpretable AI-ECG model to predict severe or complete stenosis of the four major coronary arteries on CCTA.

A major challenge, however, is that these intuitive interpretations are difficult to test quantitatively, and hence the output of such explanations lacks an explanation itself.

In the device-dependent regime, we show that entanglement of formation exactly characterizes exclusivity, establishing entanglement as the decisive thermodynamic resource. Moving to a one-sided device-independent scenario, in which only the memory holder's device is trusted, we develop an operational erasure protocol based on random dephasing and conditional operations.

Both matrices are inferred simultaneously via convex optimization of this KL divergence, and the final SF metric is obtained by mapping the minimal divergence onto the unit interval [0,1], where higher scores indicate greater faithfulness. Furthermore, we propose a thermodynamics-based semantic entropy production (SEP) metric in answer generation, and show that high faithfulness generally implies low entropy production. The SF and SEP metrics can be used jointly or separately for LLM evaluation and hallucination control. We demonstrate our framework on LLM summarization of corporate SEC 10-K filings."}

Safe sets are computed by optimizing Lyapunov functions through an original iterative Sum-of-Squares (SOS) procedure. The method is first demonstrated on a two-state benchmark, where it accurately recovers a prescribed safe region as the 1-level set of a polynomial Lyapunov function. We then describe the distinguishing characteristics of the studied vehicle-with-driver system: the control dynamics mimic human driver behavior through a delayed preview-tracking model that, with suitable parameter choices, can also emulate digital controllers. To enable SOS optimization, a polynomial approximation of the nonlinear vehicle model is derived, together with its operating-envelope constraints. The framework is then applied to understeering and oversteering scenarios, and the estimated safe sets are compared with reference boundaries obtained from exhaustive simulations. The results show that SOS techniques can efficiently deliver Lyapunov-defined safe regions, supporting their potential use for real-time safety assessment, for example as a supervisory layer for active vehicle control."}

Effective exciton-magnon coupling arises from an orbital mechanism: Magnons tilt the layer magnetizations, enabling charge carrier tunneling that mixes intra- and interlayer excitons and thereby modulate the exciton energy. We derive the effective Hamiltonian of exciton-magnon coupling, based on our calculation of the magnon spectrum taking into account short-range exchange interaction between Cr-ion spins, single-ion anisotropy, and long-range dipole-dipole interactions. The latter produces a negative group velocity of magnons at small wavevectors. We show that despite rather small renormalization of exciton's energy and effective mass by the exciton-magnon interaction, the three key two-magnon processes: exciton-magnon scattering, two-magnon absorption by exciton, and two-magnon emission are highly efficient. By solving the Boltzmann kinetic equation, we evaluate short exciton-magnon scattering time which is in the sub-ps range and strongly decreases with the increase of magnon population. Hence, exciton-magnon scattering is likely to be dominant over other scattering processes related to the exciton-phonon and exciton-disorder interactions. We demonstrate that magnons can efficiently drag excitons, resulting in a large and nearly isotropic exciton propagation that can significantly exceed the intrinsic anisotropic diffusion. Our results provide a theoretical basis for recent observations of anomalous exciton transport in CrSBr [F. Dirnberger, et al., Nat. Nano. (2025)] and establish magnon-exciton drag as a powerful mechanism for controlling exciton propagation in magnetic systems."}

This study examines how ensembles balance accuracy and overfitting across four tabular classification tasks: Breast Cancer, Heart Disease, Pima Diabetes, and Credit Card Fraud. Using repeated stratified cross validation with statistical significance testing, we compare linear models, a single decision tree, and nine ensemble methods. The results show that ensembles can reach high accuracy without large gaps by reducing variance through averaging or controlled boosting. On nearly linear and clean data, linear models already generalize well and ensembles offer little additional benefit. On datasets with meaningful nonlinear structure, tree based ensembles increase test accuracy by 5 to 7 points while keeping gaps below 3 percent. On noisy or highly imbalanced datasets, ensembles remain competitive but require regularization to avoid fitting noise or majority class patterns. We also compute simple dataset complexity indicators, such as linearity score, Fisher ratio, and noise estimate, which explain when ensembles are likely to control variance effectively. Overall, the study provides a clear view of how and when ensembles maintain high accuracy while keeping overfitting low, offering practical guidance for model selection in real world tabular applications."}

In this work we look at this question and we attempt to define the upper bounds, not just of A.I., but rather of any machine-computable process (a.k.a. an algorithm). To answer this question however, one must first precisely define A.G.I. We borrow prior work's definition of A.G.I. [1] that best describes the sentiment of the term, as used by the leading developers of A.I. That is, the ability to be creative and innovate in some field of study in a way that unlocks new and previously unknown functional capabilities in that field. Based on this definition we draw new bounds on the limits of computation. We formally prove that no algorithm can demonstrate new functional capabilities that were not already present in the initial algorithm itself. Therefore, no algorithm (and thus no A.I. model) can be truly creative in any field of study, whether that is science, engineering, art, sports, etc. In contrast, A.I. models can demonstrate existing functional capabilities, as well as combinations and permutations of existing functional capabilities. We conclude this work by discussing the implications of this proof both as it regards to the future of A.I. development, as well as to what it means for the origins of human intelligence."}

We leverage flow matching to learn a semantically preserving mapping that transports from the source to the target image distribution. This allows us to tackle challenging domain adaptation configurations for classification and semantic segmentation of Earth observation images. We conduct extensive experiments across four datasets covering adaptation scenarios such as SAR to optical translation and temporal and semantic shifts caused by natural disasters.

Cavity-optomechanical platforms combining flux-tunable microwave resonators with superconducting nanomechanical elements offer a promising route to the single-photon strong-coupling regime and enable highly sensitive probing of the mechanical degree of freedom under elevated magnetic fields. Here, we exploit this platform to investigate vortex entry processes at the single-event level. We observe discrete jumps of the mechanical resonance frequency attributable to individual vortex entry, corresponding to attonewton-scale forces and allowing quantitative extraction of single-vortex pinning energies. These signatures are superimposed on a smooth power-law background characteristic of the collective Campbell-regime of vortex elasticity.

However, designing more compact and efficient deformation schemes together with rate-distortion-optimized compression strategies for dynamic 3DGS representations remains an underexplored area. Prior methods either rely on space-time 4DGS with overspecified, short-lived Gaussian primitives or on canonical 3DGS with deformation that lacks explicit temporal control. To address this, we present TED-4DGS, a temporally activated and embedding-based deformation scheme for rate-distortion-optimized 4DGS compression that unifies the strengths of both families. TED-4DGS is built on a sparse anchor-based 3DGS representation. Each canonical anchor is assigned learnable temporal-activation parameters to specify its appearance and disappearance transitions over time, while a lightweight per-anchor temporal embedding queries a shared deformation bank to produce anchor-specific deformation. For rate-distortion compression, we incorporate an implicit neural representation (INR)-based hyperprior to model anchor attribute distributions, along with a channel-wise autoregressive model to capture intra-anchor correlations. With these novel elements, our scheme achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance on several real-world datasets.

In particular, the positivity assumption, which requires sufficient treatment overlap across confounder values, is often violated at the observational level, when massive text is represented in feature spaces. Redundant or spurious textual features inflate dimensionality, producing extreme propensity scores, unstable weights, and inflated variance in effect estimates. We address these challenges with Confounding-Aware Token Rationalization (CATR), a framework that selects a sparse necessary subset of tokens using a residual-independence diagnostic designed to preserve confounding information sufficient for unconfoundedness. By discarding irrelevant texts while retaining key signals, CATR mitigates observational-level positivity violations and stabilizes downstream causal effect estimators. Experiments on synthetic data and a real-world study using the MIMIC-III database demonstrate that CATR yields more accurate, stable, and interpretable causal effect estimates than existing baselines."}

However, accessing and characterizing their collective dynamics remains far more challenging than probing individual TLS defects. Building on our previously developed Broadband Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy (BCTDS) technique, we study the coherent control and time-resolved dynamics of TLS defect ensembles over a wide frequency range of 3-5 GHz without requiring full device fabrication, revealing quantum interference effects, memory-dependent dynamics, and dressed-state evolution within the TLS defect bath. The spectral response reveals distinct V-shaped structures corresponding to the bare eigenmode frequencies. Using these features, we extract a TLS defect spectral density of 84 GHz^-1 for a silicon sample, across a 4.1-4.6 GHz span. Furthermore, we systematically investigate amplitude- and phase-controlled interference fringes for multiple temperatures and inter-pulse delays, providing direct evidence of coherent dynamics and control. A driven minimal spin model with dipole-dipole interactions that qualitatively capture the observed behavior is presented.

To address these challenges, we propose using the entropy ratio between the current and previous policies as a new global metric that effectively quantifies the relative change in policy exploration throughout updates. Building on this metric, we introduce an \\textbf{Entropy Ratio Clipping} (ERC) mechanism that imposes bidirectional constraints on the entropy ratio.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that, under the guidance of VLM at the feature level, our method exhibits efficient and adaptive ability compared to state-of-art methods. All codes are released."}

We present EmoStyle, a framework designed to address key challenges in AIS, including the lack of training data and the emotion-style mapping. First, we construct EmoStyleSet, a content-emotion-stylized image triplet dataset derived from ArtEmis to support AIS. We then propose an Emotion-Content Reasoner that adaptively integrates emotional cues with content to learn coherent style queries. Given the discrete nature of artistic styles, we further develop a Style Quantizer that converts continuous style features into emotion-related codebook entries. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, including user studies, demonstrate that EmoStyle enhances emotional expressiveness while maintaining content consistency. Moreover, the learned emotion-aware style dictionary is adaptable to other generative tasks, highlighting its potential for broader applications.

Ontology learning, aimed at automating this process, has seen advancements in the past decade with the improvement of Natural Language Processing techniques, and especially with the recent growth of Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper investigates the challenge of identifying axioms: fundamental ontology components that define logical relations between classes and properties. In this work, we introduce an Ontology Axiom Benchmark OntoAxiom, and systematically test LLMs on that benchmark for axiom identification, evaluating different prompting strategies, ontologies, and axiom types. The benchmark consists of nine medium-sized ontologies with together 17.118 triples, and 2.771 axioms. We focus on subclass, disjoint, subproperty, domain, and range axioms. To evaluate LLM performance, we compare twelve LLMs with three shot settings and two prompting strategies: a Direct approach where we query all axioms at once, versus an Axiom-by-Axiom (AbA) approach, where each prompt queries for one axiom only. Our findings show that the AbA prompting leads to higher F1 scores than the direct approach. However, performance varies across axioms, suggesting that certain axioms are more challenging to identify. The domain also influences performance: the FOAF ontology achieves a score of 0.642 for the subclass axiom, while the music ontology reaches only 0.218. Larger LLMs outperform smaller ones, but smaller models may still be viable for resource-constrained settings. Although performance overall is not high enough to fully automate axiom identification, LLMs can provide valuable candidate axioms to support ontology engineers with the development and refinement of ontologies."}

In this paper, we introduce Credal and Interval Deep Evidential Classifications (CDEC and IDEC, respectively) as novel approaches to address UQ in classification tasks. CDEC and IDEC leverage a credal set (closed and convex set of probabilities) and an interval of evidential predictive distributions, respectively, allowing us to avoid overfitting to the training data and to systematically assess both epistemic (reducible) and aleatoric (irreducible) uncertainties. When those surpass acceptable thresholds, CDEC and IDEC have the capability to abstain from classification and flag an excess of epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty, as relevant. Conversely, within acceptable uncertainty bounds, CDEC and IDEC provide a collection of labels with robust probabilistic guarantees. CDEC and IDEC are trained using standard backpropagation and a loss function that draws from the theory of evidence. They overcome the shortcomings of previous efforts, and extend the current evidential deep learning literature. Through extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, together with their natural OoD shifts (F-MNIST/K-MNIST, SVHN/Intel, TinyImageNet), we show that CDEC and IDEC achieve competitive predictive accuracy, state-of-the-art OoD detection under epistemic and total uncertainty, and tight, well-calibrated prediction regions that expand reliably under distribution shift.

These hardware bottlenecks confine quantum PDE solvers to low-fidelity regimes despite their theoretical potential for computational speedup. We introduce a multifidelity learning framework that corrects coarse quantum solutions to high-fidelity accuracy using sparse classical training data, facilitating the path toward practical quantum utility for scientific computing. The approach trains a low-fidelity surrogate on abundant quantum solver outputs, then learns correction mappings through a multifidelity neural architecture that balances linear and nonlinear transformations. Demonstrated on benchmark nonlinear PDEs including viscous Burgers equation and incompressible Navier-Stokes flows via quantum lattice Boltzmann methods, the framework successfully corrects coarse quantum predictions and achieves temporal extrapolation well beyond the classical training window. This strategy illustrates how one can reduce expensive high-fidelity simulation requirements while producing predictions that are competitive with classical accuracy. By bridging the gap between hardware-limited quantum simulations and application requirements, this work establishes a pathway for extracting computational value from current quantum devices in real-world scientific applications, advancing both algorithm development and practical deployment of near-term quantum computing for computational physics."}

However, existing methods often struggle to generalize across different k-space undersampling patterns, requiring the training of a separate model for each specific pattern, which limits their practical applicability. To address this challenge, we propose UniFS, a Unified Frequency-Spatial Fusion model designed to handle multiple k-space undersampling patterns for MCMR tasks without any need for retraining. UniFS integrates three key modules: a Cross-Modal Frequency Fusion module, an Adaptive Mask-Based Prompt Learning module, and a Dual-Branch Complementary Refinement module. These modules work together to extract domain-invariant features from diverse k-space undersampling patterns while dynamically adapt to their own variations. Another limitation of existing MCMR methods is their tendency to focus solely on spatial information while neglect frequency characteristics, or extract only shallow frequency features, thus failing to fully leverage complementary cross-modal frequency information. To relieve this issue, UniFS introduces an adaptive prompt-guided frequency fusion module for k-space learning, significantly enhancing the model's generalization performance. We evaluate our model on the BraTS and HCP datasets with various k-space undersampling patterns and acceleration factors, including previously unseen patterns, to comprehensively assess UniFS's generalizability. Experimental results across multiple scenarios demonstrate that UniFS achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/LIKP0/UniFS."}

While agentic pipelines improve video reasoning capabilities, prevailing frameworks rely on a query-agnostic captioner to perceive video information, which wastes computation on irrelevant content and blurs fine-grained temporal and spatial information. Motivated by active perception theory, we argue that LVU agents should actively decide what, when, and where to observe, and continuously assess whether the current observation is sufficient to answer the query. We present Active Video Perception (AVP), an evidence-seeking framework that treats the video as an interactive environment and acquires compact, queryrelevant evidence directly from pixels. Concretely, AVP runs an iterative plan-observe-reflect process with MLLM agents. In each round, a planner proposes targeted video interactions, an observer executes them to extract time-stamped evidence, and a reflector evaluates the sufficiency of the evidence for the query, either halting with an answer or triggering further observation. Across five LVU benchmarks, AVP achieves highest performance with significant improvements. Notably, AVP outperforms the best agentic method by 5.7% in average accuracy while only requires 18.4% inference time and 12.4% input tokens."}

Despite recent advancements, many large-scale robotic policies still remain sensitive to key sources of observational variation such as changes in camera perspective, lighting, and the presence of distractor objects. We posit that the limited generalizability of these models arises from the substantial diversity required to robustly cover these quasistatic axes, coupled with the current scarcity of large-scale robotic datasets that exhibit rich variation across them. In this work, we propose to systematically examine what robots need to generalize across these challenging axes by introducing two key auxiliary tasks, state similarity and invariance to observational perturbations, applied to both demonstration data and static visual data. We then show that via these auxiliary tasks, leveraging both more-expensive robotic demonstration data and less-expensive, visually rich synthetic images generated from non-physics-based simulation (for example, Unreal Engine) can lead to substantial increases in generalization to unseen camera viewpoints, lighting configurations, and distractor conditions. Our results demonstrate that co-training on this diverse data improves performance by 18 percent over existing generative augmentation methods.

Although Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong capabilities in image understanding, their potential to enhance 3D object detection through intelligent data mining has not been fully explored. This paper proposes a novel cross-modal framework that leverages 2D VLMs to identify and mine rare objects from driving scenes, thereby improving 3D object detection performance. Our approach synthesizes complementary techniques such as object detection, semantic feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and multi-faceted outlier detection into a cohesive, explainable pipeline that systematically identifies rare but critical objects in driving scenes. By combining Isolation Forest and t-SNE-based outlier detection methods with concept-based filtering, the framework effectively identifies semantically meaningful rare objects. A key strength of this approach lies in its ability to extract and annotate targeted rare object concepts such as construction vehicles, motorcycles, and barriers. This substantially reduces the annotation burden and focuses only on the most valuable training samples. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that this concept-guided data mining strategy enhances the performance of 3D object detection models while utilizing only a fraction of the training data, with particularly notable improvements for challenging object categories such as trailers and bicycles compared with the same amount of random data.

To address this, we developed a Paper Correctness Checker based on GPT-5 to systematically identify mistakes in papers previously published at top AI conferences and journals. Our analysis focuses on objective mistakes-e.g., errors in formulas, derivations, calculations, figures, and tables-that have a clearly verifiable ground truth. We intentionally exclude subjective considerations such as novelty, importance, or writing quality. We find that published papers contain a non-negligible number of objective mistakes and that the average number of mistakes per paper has increased over time-from 3.8 in NeurIPS 2021 to 5.9 in NeurIPS 2025 (55.3% increase); from 4.1 in ICLR 2018 to 5.2 in ICLR 2025; and from 5.0 in TMLR 2022/23 to 5.5 in TMLR 2025. Human experts reviewed 316 potential mistakes identified by the AI Checker and confirmed that 263 were actual mistakes, corresponding to a precision of 83.2%.

The AI Checker also surfaced potentially more substantive mistakes that could affect the interpretation of results.

These methods have demonstrated remarkable empirical success but have limited theoretical understanding. Existing theoretical work is limited to sparse autoencoders with tied-weight constraints, leaving the broader family of SDL methods without formal grounding. In this work, we develop the first unified theoretical framework considering SDL as one unified optimization problem. We demonstrate how diverse methods instantiate the theoretical framwork and provide rigorous analysis on the optimization landscape.

We further propose a chain-of-thought prompting mechanism that allows multimodal large language models to reason over human instructions and environmental context, while leveraging an AutoGen-based multi-agent coordination layer to enhance robustness and collaboration in dynamic tasks. Initial experimental results demonstrate accurate human and robot trajectory prediction, validating the XR-DT framework's effectiveness in HRI tasks. By embedding human intention, environmental dynamics, and robot cognition into the XR-DT framework, our system enables interpretable, trustworthy, and adaptive HRI."}

Recent approaches consider a representation of local neighborhood in each view independently, and then capture the consistent neighbors across all views via a learning process. They suffer from two key issues. First, there is no guarantee that they can capture consistent neighbors well, especially when the same neighbors are in regions of varied densities in different views, resulting in inferior detection accuracy. Second, the learning process has a high computational cost of $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, rendering them inapplicable for large datasets. To address these issues, we propose a novel method termed \\textbf{S}pherical \\textbf{C}onsistent \\textbf{N}eighborhoods \\textbf{E}nsemble (SCoNE). It has two unique features: (a) the consistent neighborhoods are represented with multi-view instances directly, requiring no intermediate representations as used in existing approaches; and (b) the neighborhoods have data-dependent properties, which lead to large neighborhoods in sparse regions and small neighborhoods in dense regions. The data-dependent properties enable local neighborhoods in different views to be represented well as consistent neighborhoods, without learning. This leads to $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ time complexity. Empirical evaluations show that SCoNE has superior detection accuracy and runs orders-of-magnitude faster in large datasets than existing approaches."}

Effective exciton-magnon coupling arises from an orbital mechanism: Magnons tilt the layer magnetizations, enabling charge carrier tunneling that mixes intra- and interlayer excitons and thereby modulate the exciton energy. We derive the effective Hamiltonian of exciton-magnon coupling, based on our calculation of the magnon spectrum taking into account short-range exchange interaction between Cr-ion spins, single-ion anisotropy, and long-range dipole-dipole interactions. The latter produces a negative group velocity of magnons at small wavevectors. We show that despite rather small renormalization of exciton's energy and effective mass by the exciton-magnon interaction, the three key two-magnon processes: exciton-magnon scattering, two-magnon absorption by exciton, and two-magnon emission are highly efficient. By solving the Boltzmann kinetic equation, we evaluate short exciton-magnon scattering time which is in the sub-ps range and strongly decreases with the increase of magnon population. Hence, exciton-magnon scattering is likely to be dominant over other scattering processes related to the exciton-phonon and exciton-disorder interactions. We demonstrate that magnons can efficiently drag excitons, resulting in a large and nearly isotropic exciton propagation that can significantly exceed the intrinsic anisotropic diffusion. Our results provide a theoretical basis for recent observations of anomalous exciton transport in CrSBr [F. Dirnberger, et al., Nat. Nano. (2025)] and establish magnon-exciton drag as a powerful mechanism for controlling exciton propagation in magnetic systems."}

First, the Adaptive Cross-Fusion Attention (ACFA) module integrates channel feature enhancement with spatial attention mechanisms and introduces learnable guidance in three directions (planar, horizontal, and vertical) to enhance responsiveness to key regions and structural orientations. Second, the Triple Feature Fusion Attention (TFFA) module fuses features from Spatial, Fourier and Wavelet domains, achieving joint frequency-spatial representation that strengthens global dependency and structural modeling while preserving local information such as edges and textures, making it particularly effective in complex and blurred boundary scenarios. Finally, the Structural-aware Multi-scale Masking Module (SMMM) optimizes the skip connections between encoder and decoder by leveraging multi-scale context and structural saliency filtering, effectively reducing feature redundancy and improving semantic interaction quality. Working synergistically, these modules not only address the shortcomings of traditional decoders but also significantly enhance performance in high-precision tasks such as tumor segmentation and organ boundary extraction, improving both segmentation accuracy and model generalization.

No existing benchmark focuses exclusively on the unique challenges of temporal understanding in ego-centric AD footage. To fill this gap, the Temporal Understanding in Autonomous Driving (TAD) benchmark is presented, which evaluates VLMs' ability to capture the dynamic relationships between actions in AD. TAD comprises nearly 6,000 question-answer (QA) pairs, spanning 7 human-designed tasks.

When applied to TAD, current SoTA models demonstrated substandard accuracies, largely due to imperfect fine-grained motion understanding. To improve motion understanding and overall accuracy on TAD, two novel training-free solutions are proposed: Scene-CoT, that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and TCogMap, which incorporates an ego-centric temporal cognitive map. The proposed approaches are integrated with existing VLMs and improve average accuracy on TAD by up to 17.72%.

Specifically, a Semantic Alignment Modulation Fusion (SAMF) module is designed to achieve dynamic alignment and deep fusion of the global semantic priors from VFMs with task-specific features.

We introduce the Continuous Flow Operator (CFO), a framework that learns continuous-time PDE dynamics without the computational burden of standard continuous approaches, e.g., neural ODE. The key insight is repurposing flow matching to directly learn the right-hand side of PDEs without backpropagating through ODE solvers. CFO fits temporal splines to trajectory data, using finite-difference estimates of time derivatives at knots to construct probability paths whose velocities closely approximate the true PDE dynamics. A neural operator is then trained via flow matching to predict these analytic velocity fields. This approach is inherently time-resolution invariant: training accepts trajectories sampled on arbitrary, non-uniform time grids while inference queries solutions at any temporal resolution through ODE integration. Across four benchmarks (Lorenz, 1D Burgers, 2D diffusion-reaction, 2D shallow water), CFO demonstrates superior long-horizon stability and remarkable data efficiency. CFO trained on only 25% of irregularly subsampled time points outperforms autoregressive baselines trained on complete data, with relative error reductions up to 87%.

Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME) is a widely used technique that explains the prediction of any classifier by learning an interpretable model locally around the predicted instance. However, it assumes that the local decision boundary is linear and fails to capture the non-linear relationships, leading to incorrect explanations. In this paper, we propose a novel method that can generate high-fidelity explanations. Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) is used to model non-linear local boundaries that effectively captures the underlying behavior of the reference model, thereby enhancing the local fidelity of the explanation. Additionally, we utilize the N-ball sampling technique, which samples directly from the desired distribution instead of reweighting samples as done in LIME, further improving the faithfulness score. We evaluate our method on three UCI datasets across different classifiers and varying kernel widths. Experimental results show that our method yields more faithful explanations compared to baselines, achieving an average reduction of 37% in root mean square error, significantly improving local fidelity."}

However, effective MSA is challenged by alignment and fusion issues. Alignment requires synchronizing both temporal and semantic information across modalities, while fusion involves integrating these aligned features into a unified representation. Existing methods often address alignment or fusion in isolation, leading to limitations in performance and efficiency. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel framework called Dual-stream Alignment with Hierarchical Bottleneck Fusion (DashFusion). Firstly, dual-stream alignment module synchronizes multimodal features through temporal and semantic alignment. Temporal alignment employs cross-modal attention to establish frame-level correspondences among multimodal sequences. Semantic alignment ensures consistency across the feature space through contrastive learning. Secondly, supervised contrastive learning leverages label information to refine the modality features. Finally, hierarchical bottleneck fusion progressively integrates multimodal information through compressed bottleneck tokens, which achieves a balance between performance and computational efficiency. We evaluate DashFusion on three datasets: CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS. Experimental results demonstrate that DashFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our alignment and fusion techniques.

To address these challenges, we propose using the entropy ratio between the current and previous policies as a new global metric that effectively quantifies the relative change in policy exploration throughout updates. Building on this metric, we introduce an \\textbf{Entropy Ratio Clipping} (ERC) mechanism that imposes bidirectional constraints on the entropy ratio. This stabilizes policy updates at the global distribution level and compensates for the inability of PPO-clip to regulate probability shifts of un-sampled actions.

We conduct two experiments designed to assess model output under different levels of injected noise in the models initial condition. First, we perturb the initial condition of Hurricane Florence from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset (September 13-16, 2018) with varying amounts of Gaussian noise and examine the impact on predicted trajectories and forecasted storm intensity.

Our results indicate that FCNv2 accurately preserves hurricane features under low to moderate noise injection. Even under high levels of noise, the model maintains the general storm trajectory and structure, although positional accuracy begins to degrade. FCNv2 consistently underestimates storm intensity and persistence across all levels of injected noise. With full random initial conditions, the model generates smooth and cohesive forecasts after a few timesteps, implying the models tendency towards stable, smoothed outputs.

However, efforts to validate and replicate their successes have reported mixed results. To better understand the effectiveness of these optimizers at scale, in this work we investigate how to scale preconditioned optimizers via hyperparameter transfer, building on prior works such as $μ$P. We study how the optimal learning rate and weight decay should scale with model width and depth for a wide range of optimizers, including Shampoo, SOAP, and Muon, accounting for the impact of commonly used techniques such as blocking and grafting. We find that scaling the learning rate according to $μ$P improves transfer, but can still suffer from significant finite-width deviations that cause drifting optimal learning rates, which we show can be mitigated by blocking and explicit spectral normalization. For compute-optimal scaling, we find scaling independent weight decay as $1/\\mathrm{width}$ is nearly optimal across optimizers. Applying these scaling rules, we show Muon and Shampoo consistently achieve $1.4\\times$ and $1.3\\times$ speedup over AdamW for training Llama-architecture language models of sizes ranging from $190$M to $1.4$B, whereas the speedup vanishes rapidly with scale under incorrect scaling.

We introduce LYNX, an online early-exit mechanism that turns a model's own hidden-state awareness into confidence-controlled stopping decisions. LYNX attaches exit decisions to naturally occurring reasoning cues (e.g., \"hmm\", \"wait\") during generation, trains a lightweight probe on hidden states at those cue tokens using supervision from forced exits, and wraps the resulting scores in split conformal prediction to obtain distribution-free control over premature exits. Crucially, we train and calibrate this probe once on a generic mathematical corpus and reuse it unchanged across benchmarks, decoding temperatures, and even non-mathematical tasks. Across three model families spanning 1.5B to 32B parameters, a single mathematically trained probe per base model yields strong accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs. On GSM8K, LYNX matches or improves baseline accuracy while reducing tokens by 40--65\\%; on MATH-500 it improves accuracy by up to 12 points with roughly 35--60\\% fewer tokens; on AIME 2024 it recovers baseline accuracy with more than 50\\% token savings; and on CommonsenseQA, a non-math benchmark, it transfers zero-shot with modest accuracy gains and up to 70\\% fewer tokens. Compared to state-of-the-art early-exit methods, LYNX offers competitive or superior Pareto frontiers while remaining fully online, requiring no proxy models at inference, and providing explicit, user-tunable confidence guarantees."}

While some classical algorithms can infer this number directly from the data, this is typically not the case for graph neural networks (GNNs): even when a desired number of clusters is specified, standard GNN-based methods often fail to return the exact number due to the way they are designed. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a flexible and principled way to control the number of communities discovered by GNNs. Rather than assuming the true number of clusters is known, we propose a framework that allows the user to specify a plausible range and enforce these bounds during training. However, if the user wants an exact number of clusters, it may also be specified and reliably returned."}

The parts of a scene that are visible at any one time are governed by the occlusion of overlapping objects. In this work we consider \"dead leaves\" models, which replicate these occlusions when generating images by layering objects on top of each other. A dead leaves model is a generative model comprised of distributions for object position, shape, color and texture. An image is generated from a dead leaves model by sampling objects (\"leaves\") from these distributions until a stopping criterion is reached, usually when the image is fully covered or until a given number of leaves was sampled. Here, we describe a theoretical approach, based on previous work, to derive a Bayesian ideal observer for the partition of a given set of pixels based on independent dead leaves model distributions. Extending previous work, we provide step-by-step explanations for the computation of the posterior probability as well as describe factors that determine the feasibility of practically applying this computation. The dead leaves image model and the associated ideal observer can be applied to study segmentation decisions in a limited number of pixels, providing a principled upper-bound on performance, to which humans and vision algorithms could be compared."}

While Shapley value based methods provide principled feature attributions, existing formulations cannot tractably evaluate higher order interactions: the Shapley Taylor Interaction Index (STII) requires exponential scale enumeration of subsets, and current tensor based approaches such as the Marginal SHAP Tensor (MST) are restricted to first order effects. The central problem is that no existing framework simultaneously preserves the axiomatic exactness of STII and avoids the exponential computational blow up inherent to high order discrete derivatives. Here we show that high order Shapley interactions can be represented exactly as tensor network contractions, enabling polynomial time and polylog depth computation under Tensor Train (TT) structure. We introduce Interaction Tensor SHAP (IT SHAP), which reformulates STII as the contraction of a Value Tensor and a Weight Tensor, and assume a finite state TT representation of the Weight Tensor with polynomial TT ranks. Under TT structured model and distribution tensors, we show that IT SHAP reduces the exponential complex Theta(4^n) of STII to NC2 parallel time. These results demonstrate that IT SHAP provides a unified, axiomatic, and computationally tractable formulation of main effects and higher order interactions in high dimensional models. This framework establishes a foundation for scalable interaction aware explainable AI, with implications for large black box models whose combinatorial structure has previously rendered interaction analysis infeasible."}

Such evaluations quantify how well a function behaves on a distribution, but they do not address whether the internal decomposition of a model is uniquely determined by the data and evaluation design. In this paper, we introduce \\emph{Modular Jets} for regression and classification pipelines. Given a task manifold (input space), a modular decomposition, and access to module-level representations, we estimate empirical jets, which are local linear response maps that describe how each module reacts to small structured perturbations of the input. We propose an empirical notion of \\emph{mirage} regimes, where multiple distinct modular decompositions induce indistinguishable jets and thus remain observationally equivalent, and contrast this with an \\emph{identifiable} regime, where the observed jets single out a decomposition up to natural symmetries. In the setting of two-module linear regression pipelines we prove a jet-identifiability theorem. Under mild rank assumptions and access to module-level jets, the internal factorisation is uniquely determined, whereas risk-only evaluation admits a large family of mirage decompositions that implement the same input-to-output map.

While data filtering has emerged as a pretraining-time mitigation, it faces significant challenges: labeling whether data is harmful is expensive at scale, and given improving sample efficiency with larger models, even small amounts of mislabeled content could give rise to dangerous capabilities. To address risks associated with mislabeled harmful content, prior work proposed Gradient Routing (Cloud et al., 2024) -- a technique that localizes target knowledge into a dedicated subset of model parameters so they can later be removed. We explore an improved variant of Gradient Routing, which we call Selective GradienT Masking (SGTM), with particular focus on evaluating its robustness to label noise. SGTM zero-masks selected gradients such that target domain examples only update their dedicated parameters. We test SGTM's effectiveness in two applications: removing knowledge of one language from a model trained on a bilingual synthetic dataset, and removing biology knowledge from a model trained on English Wikipedia. In both cases SGTM provides better retain/forget trade-off in the presence of labeling errors compared to both data filtering and a previously proposed instantiation of Gradient Routing. Unlike shallow unlearning approaches that can be quickly undone through fine-tuning, SGTM exhibits strong robustness to adversarial fine-tuning, requiring seven times more fine-tuning steps to reach baseline performance on the forget set compared to a finetuning-based unlearning method (RMU). Our results suggest SGTM provides a promising pretraining-time complement to existing safety mitigations, particularly in settings where label noise is unavoidable."}

In particular, the positivity assumption, which requires sufficient treatment overlap across confounder values, is often violated at the observational level, when massive text is represented in feature spaces. Redundant or spurious textual features inflate dimensionality, producing extreme propensity scores, unstable weights, and inflated variance in effect estimates. We address these challenges with Confounding-Aware Token Rationalization (CATR), a framework that selects a sparse necessary subset of tokens using a residual-independence diagnostic designed to preserve confounding information sufficient for unconfoundedness. By discarding irrelevant texts while retaining key signals, CATR mitigates observational-level positivity violations and stabilizes downstream causal effect estimators. Experiments on synthetic data and a real-world study using the MIMIC-III database demonstrate that CATR yields more accurate, stable, and interpretable causal effect estimates than existing baselines."}

To address these challenges, we propose ProPhy, a Progressive Physical Alignment Framework that enables explicit physics-aware conditioning and anisotropic generation. ProPhy employs a two-stage Mixture-of-Physics-Experts (MoPE) mechanism for discriminative physical prior extraction, where Semantic Experts infer semantic-level physical principles from textual descriptions, and Refinement Experts capture token-level physical dynamics. This mechanism allows the model to learn fine-grained, physics-aware video representations that better reflect underlying physical laws. Furthermore, we introduce a physical alignment strategy that transfers the physical reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) into the Refinement Experts, facilitating a more accurate representation of dynamic physical phenomena. Extensive experiments on physics-aware video generation benchmarks demonstrate that ProPhy produces more realistic, dynamic, and physically coherent results than existing state-of-the-art methods."}

A common solution is applying downscaling methods, which include dynamical downscaling and statistical downscaling, to the outputs of global models. This work focuses on statistical downscaling, which establishes statistical relationships between low-resolution and high-resolution historical data using statistical models. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for this task, giving rise to various high-performance super-resolution models, which can be directly applied for downscaling, such as diffusion models and Generative Adversarial Networks. This work relies on a diffusion-based downscaling framework named CorrDiff. In contrast to the original work of CorrDiff, the region considered in this work is nearly 20 times larger, and we not only consider surface variables as in the original work, but also encounter high-level variables (six pressure levels) as target downscaling variables. In addition, a global residual connection is added to improve accuracy. In order to generate the 3km forecasts for the China region, we apply our trained models to the 25km global grid forecasts of CMA-GFS, an operational global model of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), and SFF, a data-driven deep learning-based weather model developed from Spherical Fourier Neural Operators (SFNO). CMA-MESO, a high-resolution regional model, is chosen as the baseline model. The experimental results demonstrate that the forecasts downscaled by our method generally outperform the direct forecasts of CMA-MESO in terms of MAE for the target variables. Our forecasts of radar composite reflectivity show that CorrDiff, as a generative model, can generate fine-scale details that lead to more realistic predictions compared to the corresponding deterministic regression models."}

However, large codebooks and effects caused by reflections or blockages of beams make an optimal beam selection challenging. In contrast to previous work and standardization efforts that opt for supervised learning to train classifiers to predict the next best beam based on previously selected beams we formulate the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and model the environment as the codebook itself. At each time step, we select a candidate beam conditioned on the belief state of the unobservable optimal beam and previously probed beams. This frames the beam selection problem as an online search procedure that locates the moving optimal beam.

Despite many advantages, LM judges display concerning biases that can impair their integrity in evaluations. One such bias is self-preference: LM judges preferring their own answers over those produced by other LMs or humans. The bias is hard to eliminate as frontier LM judges can distinguish their own outputs from those of others, even when the evaluation candidates are not labeled with their sources. In this paper, we investigate strategies to mitigate self-preference by reducing the LM judges' ability to recognize their own outputs. We apply black-box perturbations to evaluation candidates in pairwise comparison to obfuscate the authorship and reduce self-recognition. We find that perturbations as simple as synonym replacement for a few words predictably reduce self-preference. However, we also uncover fundamental challenges to eliminating the bias: when we extrapolate our perturbations to a more complete neutralization of stylistic differences between the evaluation candidates, self-preference recovers. Our findings suggest that self-recognition and self-preference can happen on many semantic levels, and complete mitigation remains challenging despite promising initial results."}

To simplify the cloth dynamics, existing methods mostly rely on linear blend skinning to obtain low-frequency posed garment shape and only regress high-frequency wrinkles. However, due to the lack of explicit skinning supervision, such skinning-based approach often produces misaligned shapes when posing the garment, consequently corrupts the high-frequency signals and fails to recover high-fidelity wrinkles. To tackle this issue, we propose a skinning-free approach by independently estimating posed (i) vertex position for low-frequency posed garment shape, and (ii) vertex normal for high-frequency local wrinkle details. In this way, each frequency modality can be effectively decoupled and directly supervised by the geometry of the deformed garment. To further improve the visual quality of animation, we propose to encode both vertex attributes as rendered texture images, so that 3D garment deformation can be equivalently achieved via 2D image transfer. This enables us to leverage powerful pretrained image models to recover fine-grained visual details in wrinkles, while maintaining superior scalability for garments of diverse topologies without relying on manual UV partition. Finally, we propose a multimodal fusion to incorporate constraints from both frequency modalities and robustly recover deformed 3D garments from transferred images. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves animation quality on various garment types and recovers finer wrinkles than state-of-the-art methods."}

Despite mining's evolution into a capital-intensive industry, there is little guidance on when to purchase new Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) hardware, and no prior computational frameworks address this decision problem. We address this gap by formulating hardware acquisition as a time series classification task, predicting whether purchasing ASIC machines yields profitable (Return on Investment (ROI) >= 1), marginal (0 < ROI < 1), or unprofitable (ROI <= 0) returns within one year. We propose MineROI-Net, an open source Transformer-based architecture designed to capture multi-scale temporal patterns in mining profitability. Evaluated on data from 20 ASIC miners released between 2015 and 2024 across diverse market regimes, MineROI-Net outperforms LSTM-based and TSLANet baselines, achieving 83.7% accuracy and 83.1% macro F1-score. The model demonstrates strong economic relevance, achieving 93.6% precision in detecting unprofitable periods and 98.5% precision for profitable ones, while avoiding misclassification of profitable scenarios as unprofitable and vice versa. These results indicate that MineROI-Net offers a practical, data-driven tool for timing mining hardware acquisitions, potentially reducing financial risk in capital-intensive mining operations.

NormalView embeds local geometric information into two-dimensional projections, in the form of normal vector estimates, and uses the projections as inputs to an image classification network, YOLOv11. In addition, we inspected the effect of multispectral radiometric intensity information on classification performance.

This method is specifically tailored to enhance the moving object detection system that we have developed and used previously. The current method introduces two innovations. This first one is a multi-input architecture that processes multiple stacked images simultaneously. The second is the incorporation of the convolutional block attention module which enables the model to focus on essential features in both spatial and channel dimensions. These advancements facilitate efficient learning from multiple inputs, leading to more robust detection of moving objects. The performance of the model is evaluated on a dataset consisting of approximately 2,000 observational images. We achieved an accuracy of nearly 99% with AUC (an Area Under the Curve) of >0.99.

While classical analyses emphasize numerical stability of Jacobian products, we show that stability alone is insufficient: learnability is governed instead by the \\emph{effective learning rates} $μ_{t,\\ell}$, per-lag and per-neuron quantities obtained from first-order expansions of gate-induced Jacobian products in Backpropagation Through Time. These effective learning rates act as multiplicative filters that control both the magnitude and anisotropy of gradient transport. Under heavy-tailed ($α$-stable) gradient noise, we prove that the minimal sample size required to detect a dependency at lag~$\\ell$ satisfies $N(\\ell)\\propto f(\\ell)^{-α}$, where $f(\\ell)=\\|μ_{t,\\ell}\\|_1$ is the effective learning rate envelope.

To address these constraints, we propose DistillFSS, a framework that embeds support-set knowledge directly into a model's parameters through a teacher--student distillation process. By internalizing few-shot reasoning into a dedicated layer within the student network, DistillFSS eliminates the need for support images at test time, enabling fast, lightweight inference, while allowing efficient extension to novel classes in unseen domains through rapid teacher-driven specialization. Combined with fine-tuning, the approach scales efficiently to large support sets and significantly reduces computational overhead. To evaluate the framework under realistic conditions, we introduce a new CD-FSS benchmark spanning medical imaging, industrial inspection, and remote sensing, with disjoint label spaces and variable support sizes.

We are the first to successfully apply Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) for this complex, cross-domain translation task. Our UOT-based framework provides robustness to outliers in the target sRGB data, allowing it to discount atypical samples that would be prohibitively costly to map. A key component of our framework is a novel ``committee of expert discriminators,'' a hybrid adversarial regularizer. This committee guides the optimal transport mapping by providing specialized, targeted gradients to correct specific ISP failure modes, including color fidelity, structural artifacts, and frequency-domain realism. To demonstrate the superiority of our approach, we retrained existing state-of-the-art ISP architectures using our paired and unpaired setups. Our experiments show that while our framework, when trained in paired mode, exceeds the performance of the original paired methods across all metrics, our unpaired mode concurrently achieves quantitative and qualitative performance that rivals, and in some cases surpasses, the original paired-trained counterparts.

However, issues such as missing values and anomalies in sequential data hinder its further development in prediction tasks. Previous research has primarily focused on extracting feature information from sequence data or addressing these suboptimal data as positive samples for knowledge transfer. A more effective approach would be to leverage these non-ideal negative samples to enhance event prediction. In response, this study highlights the advantages of non-ideal negative samples and proposes the IdealTSF framework, which integrates both ideal positive and negative samples for time series forecasting. IdealTSF consists of three progressive steps: pretraining, training, and optimization. It first pretrains the model by extracting knowledge from negative sample data, then transforms the sequence data into ideal positive samples during training. Additionally, a negative optimization mechanism with adversarial disturbances is applied. Extensive experiments demonstrate that negative sample data unlocks significant potential within the basic attention architecture for time series forecasting. Therefore, IdealTSF is particularly well-suited for applications with noisy samples or low-quality data."}

Despite rapid empirical progress, its theoretical foundations remain limited: existing methods (gradient, distribution, trajectory matching) are built on heterogeneous surrogate objectives and optimization assumptions, which makes it difficult to analyze their common principles or provide general guarantees. Moreover, it is still unclear under what conditions distilled data can retain the effectiveness of full datasets when the training configuration, such as optimizer, architecture, or augmentation, changes. To answer these questions, we propose a unified theoretical framework, termed configuration--dynamics--error analysis, which reformulates major DD approaches under a common generalization-error perspective and provides two main results: (i) a scaling law that provides a single-configuration upper bound, characterizing how the error decreases as the distilled sample size increases and explaining the commonly observed performance saturation effect; and (ii) a coverage law showing that the required distilled sample size scales linearly with configuration diversity, with provably matching upper and lower bounds. In addition, our unified analysis reveals that various matching methods are interchangeable surrogates, reducing the same generalization error, clarifying why they can all achieve dataset distillation and providing guidance on how surrogate choices affect sample efficiency and robustness. Experiments across diverse methods and configurations empirically confirm the derived laws, advancing a theoretical foundation for DD and enabling theory-driven design of compact, configuration-robust dataset distillation."}

Our pretext task trains a feature extractor solely on camera-captured photographs by classifying categorical EXIF tags (\\eg, camera model and scene type) and pairwise-ranking ordinal and continuous EXIF tags (\\eg, focal length and aperture value). Using these EXIF-induced features, we first perform one-class detection by modeling the distribution of photographic images with a Gaussian mixture model and flagging low-likelihood samples as AI-generated. We then extend to binary detection that treats the learned extractor as a strong regularizer for a classifier of the same architecture, operating on high-frequency residuals from spatially scrambled patches. Extensive experiments across various generative models demonstrate that our EXIF-induced detectors substantially advance the state of the art, delivering strong generalization to in-the-wild samples and robustness to common benign image perturbations."}

This study examines how ensembles balance accuracy and overfitting across four tabular classification tasks: Breast Cancer, Heart Disease, Pima Diabetes, and Credit Card Fraud.

The results show that ensembles can reach high accuracy without large gaps by reducing variance through averaging or controlled boosting. On nearly linear and clean data, linear models already generalize well and ensembles offer little additional benefit. On datasets with meaningful nonlinear structure, tree based ensembles increase test accuracy by 5 to 7 points while keeping gaps below 3 percent. On noisy or highly imbalanced datasets, ensembles remain competitive but require regularization to avoid fitting noise or majority class patterns. We also compute simple dataset complexity indicators, such as linearity score, Fisher ratio, and noise estimate, which explain when ensembles are likely to control variance effectively.

Unlike sparse-attention methods designed for computational efficiency, our approach leverages sparsity as a structural prior: it preserves capability while exposing a more organized and interpretable connectivity pattern. We find that this local sparsity cascades into global circuit simplification: task-specific circuits involve far fewer components (attention heads and MLPs) with up to 100x fewer edges connecting them. These results demonstrate that transformer attention can be made orders of magnitude sparser, suggesting that much of its computation is redundant and that sparsity may serve as a guiding principle for more structured and interpretable models."}

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically inspired framework well-suited to these challenges due to their natural ability to process discrete events and preserve millisecond-scale timing. This work investigates the application of SNNs to high-frequency price-spike forecasting, enhancing performance via robust hyperparameter tuning with Bayesian Optimization (BO). This work converts high-frequency stock data into spike trains and evaluates three architectures: an established unsupervised STDP-trained SNN, a novel SNN with explicit inhibitory competition, and a supervised backpropagation network. BO was driven by a novel objective, Penalized Spike Accuracy (PSA), designed to ensure a network's predicted price spike rate aligns with the empirical rate of price events. Simulated trading demonstrated that models optimized with PSA consistently outperformed their Spike Accuracy (SA)-tuned counterparts and baselines. Specifically, the extended SNN model with PSA achieved the highest cumulative return (76.8%) in simple backtesting, significantly surpassing the supervised alternative (42.54% return).

Unlike existing unrolling-based networks, our 3D-CSCNet is designed within the powerful autoencoder (AE) framework. Specifically, to solve the 3D CSC problem, we propose a 3D CSC block (3D-CSCB) derived through deep algorithm unrolling.

However, existing methods often struggle to generalize across different k-space undersampling patterns, requiring the training of a separate model for each specific pattern, which limits their practical applicability. To address this challenge, we propose UniFS, a Unified Frequency-Spatial Fusion model designed to handle multiple k-space undersampling patterns for MCMR tasks without any need for retraining. UniFS integrates three key modules: a Cross-Modal Frequency Fusion module, an Adaptive Mask-Based Prompt Learning module, and a Dual-Branch Complementary Refinement module. These modules work together to extract domain-invariant features from diverse k-space undersampling patterns while dynamically adapt to their own variations. Another limitation of existing MCMR methods is their tendency to focus solely on spatial information while neglect frequency characteristics, or extract only shallow frequency features, thus failing to fully leverage complementary cross-modal frequency information. To relieve this issue, UniFS introduces an adaptive prompt-guided frequency fusion module for k-space learning, significantly enhancing the model's generalization performance. We evaluate our model on the BraTS and HCP datasets with various k-space undersampling patterns and acceleration factors, including previously unseen patterns, to comprehensively assess UniFS's generalizability. Experimental results across multiple scenarios demonstrate that UniFS achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/LIKP0/UniFS."}

This work introduces a data-driven machine learning (ML) approach to predicting vapor pressure, enabling virtual screening and discovery of new space-suitable liquid lubricants. The ML models are trained with data from both high-throughput molecular dynamics simulations and experimental databases. The models are designed to prioritize interpretability, enabling the relationships between chemical structure and vapor pressure to be identified.

However, it remains an open question of how to best determine which of the many possible model checkpoints resulting from a large training run to use as the starting point. This becomes especially important when data for the target task of interest is scarce, unlabeled and out-of-distribution. In such scenarios, common methods relying on in-distribution validation data become unreliable or inapplicable. This work proposes a novel approach for model selection that operates reliably on just a few unlabeled examples from the target task. Our approach is based on a novel concept: Neural Coherence, which entails characterizing a model's activation statistics for source and target domains, allowing one to define model selection methods with high data-efficiency. We provide experiments where models are pre-trained on ImageNet1K and examine target domains consisting of Food-101, PlantNet-300K and iNaturalist. We also evaluate it in many meta-learning settings. Our approach significantly improves generalization across these different target domains compared to established baselines.

These methods have demonstrated remarkable empirical success but have limited theoretical understanding. Existing theoretical work is limited to sparse autoencoders with tied-weight constraints, leaving the broader family of SDL methods without formal grounding. In this work, we develop the first unified theoretical framework considering SDL as one unified optimization problem.

Rather, they minimize the constraint violations in a soft way. Strict satisfaction of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) to embed domain knowledge and first-principles in data-driven models is generally challenging. This is because data-driven models consider the original functions to be black-box whose derivatives can only be obtained after evaluating the functions. We introduce DAE-HardNet, a physics-constrained (rather than simply physics-informed) neural network that learns both the functions and their derivatives simultaneously, while enforcing algebraic as well as differential constraints. This is done by projecting model predictions onto the constraint manifold using a differentiable projection layer. We apply DAE-HardNet to several systems and test problems governed by DAEs, including the dynamic Lotka-Volterra predator-prey system and transient heat conduction. We also show the ability of DAE-HardNet to estimate unknown parameters through a parameter estimation problem. Compared to multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and PINNs, DAE-HardNet achieves orders of magnitude reduction in the physics loss while maintaining the prediction accuracy. It has the added benefits of learning the derivatives which improves the constrained learning of the backbone neural network prior to the projection layer. For specific problems, this suggests that the projection layer can be bypassed for faster inference. The current implementation and codes are available at https://github.com/SOULS-TAMU/DAE-HardNet."}

Our approach introduces two key modules: a Geodesic Distance Approximator (GDA), which estimates geodesic distances between points to capture the latent manifold topology, and a Manifold-Aware Feature Extractor (MAFE), which utilizes geodesic-based $k$-NN groupings and a geodesic-relational attention mechanism to guide the hierarchical feature extraction process.

Yet, as sequence length and batch size grow, the cache becomes a major memory bottleneck. Prior compression methods typically apply low-rank decomposition to keys alone or attempt to jointly embed queries and keys, but both approaches neglect that attention fundamentally depends on their inner products. In this work, we prove that such strategies are suboptimal for approximating the attention matrix. We introduce KQ-SVD, a simple and computationally efficient method that directly performs an optimal low-rank decomposition of the attention matrix via a closed-form solution. By targeting the true source of redundancy, KQ-SVD preserves attention outputs with higher fidelity under compression. Extensive evaluations on LLaMA and Mistral models demonstrate that our approach consistently delivers superior projection quality."}

Existing accelerators -- such as sparse attention and step-distilled samplers -- typically target a single dimension in isolation and quickly encounter diminishing returns, as the remaining bottlenecks become dominant. In this work, we introduce USV (Unified Sparsification for Video diffusion models), an end-to-end trainable framework that overcomes this limitation by jointly orchestrating sparsification across both the model's internal computation and its sampling process. USV learns a dynamic, data- and timestep-dependent sparsification policy that prunes redundant attention connections, adaptively merges semantically similar tokens, and reduces denoising steps, treating them not as independent tricks but as coordinated actions within a single optimization objective. This multi-dimensional co-design enables strong mutual reinforcement among previously disjoint acceleration strategies. Extensive experiments on large-scale video generation benchmarks demonstrate that USV achieves up to 83.3% speedup in the denoising process and 22.7% end-to-end acceleration, while maintaining high visual fidelity. Our results highlight unified, dynamic sparsification as a practical path toward efficient, high-quality video generation."}

An emerging approach to address this problem relies on \\emph{disagreement discrepancy} -- a measure of how the disagreement between two models changes under a shifting distribution. The process of maximizing this measure has seen applications in bounding error under shifts, testing for harmful shifts, and training more robust models. However, this optimization involves the non-differentiable zero-one loss, necessitating the use of practical surrogate losses. We prove that existing surrogates for disagreement discrepancy are not Bayes consistent, revealing a fundamental flaw: maximizing these surrogates can fail to maximize the true disagreement discrepancy. To address this, we introduce new theoretical results providing both upper and lower bounds on the optimality gap for such surrogates. Guided by this theory, we propose a novel disagreement loss that, when paired with cross-entropy, yields a provably consistent surrogate for disagreement discrepancy. Empirical evaluations across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method provides more accurate and robust estimates of disagreement discrepancy than existing approaches, particularly under challenging adversarial conditions."}

In this work, we propose a novel and easy-to-implement strategy to separate the point cloud into annotatable regions. In our approach, we utilize a 2D grid to subdivide the point cloud into columns. To identify the next data to be annotated, we employ a network ensemble to estimate the uncertainty in the network output. We evaluate our method on the S3DIS dataset, the Toronto-3D dataset, and a large-scale urban 3D point cloud of the city of Freiburg, which we labeled in parts manually. The extensive evaluation shows that our method yields performance on par with, or even better than, complex state-of-the-art methods on all datasets. Furthermore, we provide results suggesting that in the context of point clouds the annotated area can be a more meaningful measure for active learning algorithms than the number of annotated points."}

Data science tools can be used to produce synthetic data that preserve critical moments of the empirical data but do not contain the records of any existing individual respondent or business. Developing public-use firm data from surveys presents unique challenges different from demographic data, because there is a lack of anonymity and certain industries can be easily identified in each geographic area.

Such evaluations quantify how well a function behaves on a distribution, but they do not address whether the internal decomposition of a model is uniquely determined by the data and evaluation design. In this paper, we introduce \\emph{Modular Jets} for regression and classification pipelines. Given a task manifold (input space), a modular decomposition, and access to module-level representations, we estimate empirical jets, which are local linear response maps that describe how each module reacts to small structured perturbations of the input. We propose an empirical notion of \\emph{mirage} regimes, where multiple distinct modular decompositions induce indistinguishable jets and thus remain observationally equivalent, and contrast this with an \\emph{identifiable} regime, where the observed jets single out a decomposition up to natural symmetries. In the setting of two-module linear regression pipelines we prove a jet-identifiability theorem. Under mild rank assumptions and access to module-level jets, the internal factorisation is uniquely determined, whereas risk-only evaluation admits a large family of mirage decompositions that implement the same input-to-output map. We then present an algorithm (MoJet) for empirical jet estimation and mirage diagnostics, and illustrate the framework using linear and deep regression as well as pipeline classification."}

Sensors fail, records are inconsistent, and datasets collected from different sources often differ in scale, sampling rate, and quality. These differences create missing values that make it difficult to combine data and build reliable models. Standard imputation methods such as regression models, expectation-maximization, and multiple imputation rely on strong assumptions about linearity and independence. These assumptions rarely hold for complex or heterogeneous data, which can lead to biased or over-smoothed estimates. We propose Impugan, a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) for imputing missing values and integrating heterogeneous datasets. The model is trained on complete samples to learn how missing variables depend on observed ones. During inference, the generator reconstructs missing entries from available features, and the discriminator enforces realism by distinguishing true from imputed data. This adversarial process allows Impugan to capture nonlinear and multimodal relationships that conventional methods cannot represent. In experiments on benchmark datasets and a multi-source integration task, Impugan achieves up to 82\\% lower Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) and 70\\% lower mutual-information deviation (MI) compared to leading baselines. These results show that adversarially trained generative models provide a scalable and principled approach for imputing and merging incomplete, heterogeneous data.

While agentic pipelines improve video reasoning capabilities, prevailing frameworks rely on a query-agnostic captioner to perceive video information, which wastes computation on irrelevant content and blurs fine-grained temporal and spatial information. Motivated by active perception theory, we argue that LVU agents should actively decide what, when, and where to observe, and continuously assess whether the current observation is sufficient to answer the query. We present Active Video Perception (AVP), an evidence-seeking framework that treats the video as an interactive environment and acquires compact, queryrelevant evidence directly from pixels. Concretely, AVP runs an iterative plan-observe-reflect process with MLLM agents. In each round, a planner proposes targeted video interactions, an observer executes them to extract time-stamped evidence, and a reflector evaluates the sufficiency of the evidence for the query, either halting with an answer or triggering further observation. Across five LVU benchmarks, AVP achieves highest performance with significant improvements. Notably, AVP outperforms the best agentic method by 5.7% in average accuracy while only requires 18.4% inference time and 12.4% input tokens."}

MaxShapley is a special case of the celebrated Shapley value; it leverages a decomposable max-sum utility function to compute attributions with linear computation in the number of documents, as opposed to the exponential cost of Shapley values. We evaluate MaxShapley on three multi-hop QA datasets (HotPotQA, MuSiQUE, MS MARCO); MaxShapley achieves comparable attribution quality to exact Shapley computation, while consuming a fraction of its tokens--for instance, it gives up to an 8x reduction in resource consumption over prior state-of-the-art methods at the same attribution accuracy."}

We argue that this arises because RL implicitly optimizes the \"mode-seeking\" or \"zero-forcing\" Reverse KL to a target distribution causing the model to concentrate mass on certain high-probability regions of the target while neglecting others. In this work, we instead begin from an explicit target distribution, obtained by filtering out incorrect answers while preserving the relative probabilities of correct ones. Starting from a pre-trained LLM, we approximate this target distribution using the $α$-divergence family, which unifies prior approaches and enables direct control of the precision-diversity trade-off by interpolating between mode-seeking and mass-covering divergences.

Recent approaches such as MindJourney attempt to mitigate this gap through test-time scaling where a world model imagines action-conditioned trajectories and a heuristic verifier selects helpful views from such trajectories. In this work, we systematically examine how such test-time verifiers behave across benchmarks, uncovering both their promise and their pitfalls. Our uncertainty-based analyses show that MindJourney's verifier provides little meaningful calibration, and that random scoring often reduces answer entropy equally well, thus exposing systematic action biases and unreliable reward signals. To mitigate these, we introduce a Verification through Spatial Assertions (ViSA) framework that grounds the test-time reward in verifiable, frame-anchored micro-claims. This principled verifier consistently improves spatial reasoning on the SAT-Real benchmark and corrects trajectory-selection biases through more balanced exploratory behavior. However, on the challenging MMSI-Bench, none of the verifiers, including ours, achieve consistent scaling, suggesting that the current world models form an information bottleneck where imagined views fail to enrich fine-grained reasoning.

Our approach combines a lightweight U-Net transfer encoder with a diffusion-based generative model. The simpler U-Net is first pretrained on a long time series of coarse resolution data to learn spatiotemporal representations; its encoder is then frozen and transferred to a larger downscaling model as physically meaningful latent features. Our application uses NASA's MERRA-2 reanalysis as the low resolution source domain (50 km) and the GEOS-5 Nature Run (G5NR) as the high resolution target (7 km). Our study area included a large area in Asia, which was made computationally tractable by splitting into two subregions and four seasons. We conducted domain similarity analysis using Wasserstein distances confirmed minimal distributional shift between MERRA-2 and G5NR, validating the safety of parameter frozen transfer. Across seasonal regional splits, our model achieved excellent performance (R2 = 0.65 to 0.94), outperforming comparison models including deterministic U-Nets, variational autoencoders, and prior transfer learning baselines. Out of data evaluations using semivariograms, ACF/PACF, and lag-based RMSE/R2 demonstrated that the predicted downscaled images preserved physically consistent spatial variability and temporal autocorrelation, enabling stable autoregressive reconstruction beyond the G5NR record. These results show that transfer enhanced diffusion models provide a robust and physically coherent solution for downscaling a long time series of coarse resolution images with limited training periods. This advancement has significant implications for improving environmental exposure assessment and long term environmental monitoring."}

However, most existing classification frameworks face challenges in multicenter studies, as they often neglect inter-site heterogeneity and lack mechanisms to quantify uncertainty, which limits their robustness and clinical applicability. To address these issues, we proposed Uncertainty-Guided Federated Domain Adaptation (UG-FedDA), a novel multicenter AD classification framework that integrates uncertainty quantification (UQ) with federated domain adaptation to handle cross-site structure magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) heterogeneity under privacy constraints. Our approach extracts multi-template region-of-interest (RoI) features using a self-attention transformer, capturing both regional representations and their interactions. UQ is integrated to guide feature alignment, mitigating source-target distribution shifts by down-weighting uncertain samples. Experiments are conducted on three public datasets: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle study (AIBL), and the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS). UG-FedDA achieved consistent cross-domain improvements in accuracy, sensitivity, and area under the ROC curve across three classification tasks: AD vs. normal controls (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) vs. AD, and NC vs. MCI. For NC vs. AD, UG-FedDA achieves accuracies of 90.54%, 89.04%, and 77.78% on ADNI, AIBL and OASIS datasets, respectively.

We propose two new unsupervised metrics for faithfulness evaluation using insights from information theory and thermodynamics. Our approach treats an LLM as a bipartite information engine where hidden layers act as a Maxwell demon controlling transformations of context $C $ into answer $A$ via prompt $Q$. We model Question-Context-Answer (QCA) triplets as probability distributions over shared topics. Topic transformations from $C$ to $Q$ and $A$ are modeled as transition matrices ${\\bf Q}$ and ${\\bf A}$ encoding the query goal and actual result, respectively. Our semantic faithfulness (SF) metric quantifies faithfulness for any given QCA triplet by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between these matrices. Both matrices are inferred simultaneously via convex optimization of this KL divergence, and the final SF metric is obtained by mapping the minimal divergence onto the unit interval [0,1], where higher scores indicate greater faithfulness. Furthermore, we propose a thermodynamics-based semantic entropy production (SEP) metric in answer generation, and show that high faithfulness generally implies low entropy production. The SF and SEP metrics can be used jointly or separately for LLM evaluation and hallucination control. We demonstrate our framework on LLM summarization of corporate SEC 10-K filings."}

Recent approaches have sought to address this challenge by training on large collections of heterogeneous robotic datasets. However, unlike vision or language data, robotic demonstrations exhibit substantial heterogeneity across embodiments and action spaces as well as other prominent variations such as senor configurations and action control frequencies. The lack of explicit designs for handling such heterogeneity causes existing methods to struggle with integrating diverse factors, thereby limiting their generalization and leading to degraded performance when transferred to new settings. In this paper, we present HiMoE-VLA, a novel vision-language-action (VLA) framework tailored to effectively handle diverse robotic data with heterogeneity. Specifically, we introduce a Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts (HiMoE) architecture for the action module which adaptively handles multiple sources of heterogeneity across layers and gradually abstracts them into shared knowledge representations.

We propose a key principle for compositing image latents: Pixel-Equivalent Latent Compositing (PELC). An equivalent latent compositor should be the same as compositing in pixel space. This principle enables full-resolution mask control and true soft-edge alpha compositing, even though VAEs compress images 8x spatially. Modern VAEs capture global context beyond patch-aligned local structure, so linear latent blending cannot be pixel-equivalent: it produces large artifacts at mask seams and global degradation and color shifts. We introduce DecFormer, a 7.7M-parameter transformer that predicts per-channel blend weights and an off-manifold residual correction to realize mask-consistent latent fusion. DecFormer is trained so that decoding after fusion matches pixel-space alpha compositing, is plug-compatible with existing diffusion pipelines, requires no backbone finetuning and adds only 0.07% of FLUX.1-Dev's parameters and 3.5% FLOP overhead. On the FLUX.1 family, DecFormer restores global color consistency, soft-mask support, sharp boundaries, and high-fidelity masking, reducing error metrics around edges by up to 53% over standard mask interpolation. Used as an inpainting prior, a lightweight LoRA on FLUX.1-Dev with DecFormer achieves fidelity comparable to FLUX.1-Fill, a fully finetuned inpainting model. While we focus on inpainting, PELC is a general recipe for pixel-equivalent latent editing, as we demonstrate on a complex color-correction task."}

However, more modalities bring more vulnerabilities to being utilized for jailbreak attacks, which induces MLLMs to output harmful content. Due to the strong reasoning ability of MLLMs, previous jailbreak attacks try to explore reasoning safety risk in text modal, while similar threats have been largely overlooked in the visual modal. To fully evaluate potential safety risks in the visual reasoning task, we propose Visual Reasoning Sequential Attack (VRSA), which induces MLLMs to gradually externalize and aggregate complete harmful intent by decomposing the original harmful text into several sequentially related sub-images. In particular, to enhance the rationality of the scene in the image sequence, we propose Adaptive Scene Refinement to optimize the scene most relevant to the original harmful query. To ensure the semantic continuity of the generated image, we propose Semantic Coherent Completion to iteratively rewrite each sub-text combined with contextual information in this scene. In addition, we propose Text-Image Consistency Alignment to keep the semantical consistency. A series of experiments demonstrates that the VRSA can achieve a higher attack success rate compared with the state-of-the-art jailbreak attack methods on both the open-source and closed-source MLLMs such as GPT-4o and Claude-4.5-Sonnet."}

This fused metric is demonstrated to correlate more strongly with human judgements across all tested domains for faithfulness. Improving the ability to evaluate the faithfulness of LLMs, allows for greater confidence to be placed within models, allowing for their implementation in a greater diversity of scenarios.

Prior work shows strong impossibility results, e.g. that even under natural assumptions, no aggregation of the experts' individual forecasts can outperform simply following a random expert (Neyman and Roughgarden, 2022).\n  In this paper, we introduce a more general framework that allows the principal to elicit richer information from experts through structured queries. Our framework ensures that experts will truthfully report their underlying beliefs, and also enables us to define notions of complexity over the difficulty of asking these queries. Under a general model of independent but overlapping expert signals, we show that optimal aggregation is achievable in the worst case with each complexity measure bounded above by the number of agents $n$. We further establish tight tradeoffs between accuracy and query complexity: aggregation error decreases linearly with the number of queries, and vanishes when the \"order of reasoning\" and number of agents relevant to a query is $ω(\\sqrt{n})$. These results demonstrate that modest extensions to the space of expert queries dramatically strengthen the power of robust forecast aggregation. We therefore expect that our new query framework will open up a fruitful line of research in this area."}

While editing in the RAW domain provides greater accuracy and flexibility, most edits are performed on the camera's display-referred output (e.g., 8-bit sRGB JPEG) since RAW images are rarely stored. Existing RAW reconstruction methods can recover RAW data from sRGB images, but these approaches are typically optimized for pixel-wise RAW reconstruction fidelity and tend to degrade under diverse rendering styles and editing operations. We introduce a plug-and-play, edit-aware loss function that can be integrated into any existing RAW reconstruction framework to make the recovered RAWs more robust to different rendering styles and edits. Our loss formulation incorporates a modular, differentiable image signal processor (ISP) that simulates realistic photofinishing pipelines with tunable parameters. During training, parameters for each ISP module are randomly sampled from carefully designed distributions that model practical variations in real camera processing. The loss is then computed in sRGB space between ground-truth and reconstructed RAWs rendered through this differentiable ISP. Incorporating our loss improves sRGB reconstruction quality by up to 1.5-2 dB PSNR across various editing conditions. Moreover, when applied to metadata-assisted RAW reconstruction methods, our approach enables fine-tuning for target edits, yielding further gains. Since photographic editing is the primary motivation for RAW reconstruction in consumer imaging, our simple yet effective loss function provides a general mechanism for enhancing edit fidelity and rendering flexibility across existing methods."}

To mitigate such behavior, we propose CoT-Recipe, a formal approach to modulate the mix of CoT and non-CoT examples in meta-training sequences. We demonstrate that careful modulation via CoT-Recipe can increase the accuracy of transformers on novel tasks by up to 300% even when there are no CoT examples available in-context. We confirm the broader effectiveness of these techniques by applying them to pretrained LLMs (Qwen2.5 series) for symbolic reasoning tasks and observing gains of up to 130% in accuracy."}

Existing attempts to stop early either manipulate decoding with extra sampling and heuristics, rely on auxiliary verifier models, or operate only as post-hoc analysis pipelines without formal guarantees. We introduce LYNX, an online early-exit mechanism that turns a model's own hidden-state awareness into confidence-controlled stopping decisions. LYNX attaches exit decisions to naturally occurring reasoning cues (e.g., \"hmm\", \"wait\") during generation, trains a lightweight probe on hidden states at those cue tokens using supervision from forced exits, and wraps the resulting scores in split conformal prediction to obtain distribution-free control over premature exits. Crucially, we train and calibrate this probe once on a generic mathematical corpus and reuse it unchanged across benchmarks, decoding temperatures, and even non-mathematical tasks. Across three model families spanning 1.5B to 32B parameters, a single mathematically trained probe per base model yields strong accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs. On GSM8K, LYNX matches or improves baseline accuracy while reducing tokens by 40--65\\%; on MATH-500 it improves accuracy by up to 12 points with roughly 35--60\\% fewer tokens; on AIME 2024 it recovers baseline accuracy with more than 50\\% token savings; and on CommonsenseQA, a non-math benchmark, it transfers zero-shot with modest accuracy gains and up to 70\\% fewer tokens.

While agentic pipelines improve video reasoning capabilities, prevailing frameworks rely on a query-agnostic captioner to perceive video information, which wastes computation on irrelevant content and blurs fine-grained temporal and spatial information. Motivated by active perception theory, we argue that LVU agents should actively decide what, when, and where to observe, and continuously assess whether the current observation is sufficient to answer the query. We present Active Video Perception (AVP), an evidence-seeking framework that treats the video as an interactive environment and acquires compact, queryrelevant evidence directly from pixels. Concretely, AVP runs an iterative plan-observe-reflect process with MLLM agents. In each round, a planner proposes targeted video interactions, an observer executes them to extract time-stamped evidence, and a reflector evaluates the sufficiency of the evidence for the query, either halting with an answer or triggering further observation. Across five LVU benchmarks, AVP achieves highest performance with significant improvements. Notably, AVP outperforms the best agentic method by 5.7% in average accuracy while only requires 18.4% inference time and 12.4% input tokens."}

In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study to uncover the distinguishing patterns of Pink Slime content and propose detection strategies based on these insights. Beyond traditional generation methods, we highlight a new adversarial vector: modifications through large language models (LLMs). Our findings reveal that even consumer-accessible LLMs can significantly undermine existing detection systems, reducing their performance by up to 40% in F1-score. To counter this threat, we introduce a robust learning framework specifically designed to resist LLM-based adversarial attacks and adapt to the evolving landscape of automated pink slime journalism, and showed and improvement by up to 27%."}

Accurate postoperative facial appearance prediction remains challenging due to the complex nonlinear interactions between skeletal movements and facial soft tissue. Existing biomechanical, parametric models and deep-learning approaches either lack computational efficiency or fail to fully capture these intricate interactions. To address these limitations, we propose Neural Implicit Craniofacial Model (NICE) which employs implicit neural representations for accurate anatomical reconstruction and surgical outcome prediction. NICE comprises a shape module, which employs region-specific implicit Signed Distance Function (SDF) decoders to reconstruct the facial surface, maxilla, and mandible, and a surgery module, which employs region-specific deformation decoders. These deformation decoders are driven by a shared surgical latent code to effectively model the complex, nonlinear biomechanical response of the facial surface to skeletal movements, incorporating anatomical prior knowledge. The deformation decoders output point-wise displacement fields, enabling precise modeling of surgical outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NICE outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, notably improving prediction accuracy in critical facial regions such as lips and chin, while robustly preserving anatomical integrity. This work provides a clinically viable tool for enhanced surgical planning and patient consultation in orthognathic procedures."}

We show that TopK SAEs can reveal biologically meaningful latent features, but high feature concept correlation does not guarantee causal control over generation. In contrast, Ordered SAEs impose an hierarchical structure that reliably identifies steerable features, but at the expense of more complex and less interpretable activation patterns. These findings advance the mechanistic interpretability of domain-specific protein language models and suggest that, while TopK SAEs are sufficient for mapping latent features to concepts, Ordered SAEs are preferable when precise generative steering is required."}

Recent works address these challenges by constructing a clustering prototype bank and then refining masks in a separate stage; however, such two-stage pipelines are costly, sensitive to hyperparameters, and decouple prototype discovery from segmentation learning, limiting their effectiveness and efficiency. We propose a cluster-free, one-stage learnable-prototype framework with diversity regularization to enhance morphological intra-class heterogeneity coverage. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on BCSS-WSSS, outperforming prior methods in mIoU and mDice. Qualitative segmentation maps show sharper boundaries and fewer mislabels, and activation heatmaps further reveal that, compared with clustering-based prototypes, our learnable prototypes cover more diverse and complementary regions within each class, providing consistent qualitative evidence for their effectiveness."}

A significant challenge in robotic assistance lies in surgical path planning, which often relies on the registration of intraoperative 2D images with preoperative 3D CT scans. This requirement can be burdensome and costly, particularly in procedures like vertebroplasty, where preoperative CT scans are not routinely performed. To address this issue, we introduce a differentiable rendering-based framework for 3D transpedicular path planning utilizing bi-planar 2D X-rays. Our method integrates differentiable rendering with a vertebral atlas generated through a Statistical Shape Model (SSM) and employs a learned similarity loss to refine the SSM shape and pose dynamically, independent of fixed imaging geometries. We evaluated our framework in two stages: first, through vertebral reconstruction from orthogonal X-rays for benchmarking, and second, via clinician-in-the-loop path planning using arbitrary-view X-rays. Our results indicate that our method outperformed a normalized cross-correlation baseline in reconstruction metrics (DICE: 0.75 vs. 0.65) and achieved comparable performance to the state-of-the-art model ReVerteR (DICE: 0.77), while maintaining generalization to arbitrary views. Success rates for bipedicular planning reached 82% with synthetic data and 75% with cadaver data, exceeding the 66% and 31% rates of a 2D-to-3D baseline, respectively. In conclusion, our framework facilitates versatile, CT-free 3D path planning for robot-assisted vertebroplasty, effectively accommodating real-world imaging diversity without the need for preoperative CT scans."}

Object verification has relied heavily on human eyes, which usually results in significant labor costs. In order to address this limitation and reduce the reliance on manual intervention, we propose a multi-input convolutional neural network integrated with a convolutional block attention module. This method is specifically tailored to enhance the moving object detection system that we have developed and used previously. The current method introduces two innovations. This first one is a multi-input architecture that processes multiple stacked images simultaneously. The second is the incorporation of the convolutional block attention module which enables the model to focus on essential features in both spatial and channel dimensions. These advancements facilitate efficient learning from multiple inputs, leading to more robust detection of moving objects. The performance of the model is evaluated on a dataset consisting of approximately 2,000 observational images. We achieved an accuracy of nearly 99% with AUC (an Area Under the Curve) of >0.99.

Despite these exceptional capabilities, controllable video models often hallucinate - generating future video frames that are misaligned with physical reality - which raises serious concerns in many tasks such as robot policy evaluation and planning. However, state-of-the-art video models lack the ability to assess and express their confidence, impeding hallucination mitigation. To rigorously address this challenge, we propose C3, an uncertainty quantification (UQ) method for training continuous-scale calibrated controllable video models for dense confidence estimation at the subpatch level, precisely localizing the uncertainty in each generated video frame. Our UQ method introduces three core innovations to empower video models to estimate their uncertainty. First, our method develops a novel framework that trains video models for correctness and calibration via strictly proper scoring rules. Second, we estimate the video model's uncertainty in latent space, avoiding training instability and prohibitive training costs associated with pixel-space approaches. Third, we map the dense latent-space uncertainty to interpretable pixel-level uncertainty in the RGB space for intuitive visualization, providing high-resolution uncertainty heatmaps that identify untrustworthy regions. Through extensive experiments on large-scale robot learning datasets (Bridge and DROID) and real-world evaluations, we demonstrate that our method not only provides calibrated uncertainty estimates within the training distribution, but also enables effective out-of-distribution detection."}

Recent approaches such as MindJourney attempt to mitigate this gap through test-time scaling where a world model imagines action-conditioned trajectories and a heuristic verifier selects helpful views from such trajectories. In this work, we systematically examine how such test-time verifiers behave across benchmarks, uncovering both their promise and their pitfalls. Our uncertainty-based analyses show that MindJourney's verifier provides little meaningful calibration, and that random scoring often reduces answer entropy equally well, thus exposing systematic action biases and unreliable reward signals. To mitigate these, we introduce a Verification through Spatial Assertions (ViSA) framework that grounds the test-time reward in verifiable, frame-anchored micro-claims. This principled verifier consistently improves spatial reasoning on the SAT-Real benchmark and corrects trajectory-selection biases through more balanced exploratory behavior. However, on the challenging MMSI-Bench, none of the verifiers, including ours, achieve consistent scaling, suggesting that the current world models form an information bottleneck where imagined views fail to enrich fine-grained reasoning. Together, these findings chart the bad, good, and ugly aspects of test-time verification for world-model-based reasoning.

We introduce MusWikiDB, a vector database of 3.2M passages from 144K music-related Wikipedia pages, and ArtistMus, a benchmark of 1,000 questions on 500 diverse artists with metadata such as genre, debut year, and topic. These resources enable systematic evaluation of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for MQA. Experiments show that RAG markedly improves factual accuracy; open-source models gain up to +56.8 percentage points (for example, Qwen3 8B improves from 35.0 to 91.8), approaching proprietary model performance. RAG-style fine-tuning further boosts both factual recall and contextual reasoning, improving results on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. MusWikiDB also yields approximately 6 percentage points higher accuracy and 40% faster retrieval than a general-purpose Wikipedia corpus.

Its success is largely attributed to deep learning, which leverages large datasets and effective loss functions to learn discriminative features. Despite these advances, facial recognition still faces challenges in explainability, demographic bias, privacy, and robustness to aging, pose variations, lighting changes, occlusions, and facial expressions. Privacy regulations have also led to the degradation of several datasets, raising legal, ethical, and privacy concerns. Synthetic facial data generation has been proposed as a promising solution. It mitigates privacy issues, enables experimentation with controlled facial attributes, alleviates demographic bias, and provides supplementary data to improve models trained on real data. This study compares the effectiveness of synthetic facial datasets generated using different techniques in facial recognition tasks. We evaluate accuracy, rank-1, rank-5, and the true positive rate at a false positive rate of 0.01% on eight leading datasets, offering a comparative analysis not extensively explored in the literature.

However, effective MSA is challenged by alignment and fusion issues. Alignment requires synchronizing both temporal and semantic information across modalities, while fusion involves integrating these aligned features into a unified representation. Existing methods often address alignment or fusion in isolation, leading to limitations in performance and efficiency. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel framework called Dual-stream Alignment with Hierarchical Bottleneck Fusion (DashFusion). Firstly, dual-stream alignment module synchronizes multimodal features through temporal and semantic alignment. Temporal alignment employs cross-modal attention to establish frame-level correspondences among multimodal sequences. Semantic alignment ensures consistency across the feature space through contrastive learning. Secondly, supervised contrastive learning leverages label information to refine the modality features. Finally, hierarchical bottleneck fusion progressively integrates multimodal information through compressed bottleneck tokens, which achieves a balance between performance and computational efficiency. We evaluate DashFusion on three datasets: CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS. Experimental results demonstrate that DashFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our alignment and fusion techniques.

We model SIMs as trainable linear operators capable of emulating both supervised linear aligners and zero-shot Parseval-frame-based equalizers. To realize these operators physically, we develop a gradient-based optimization procedure that tailors the metasurface transfer function to a desired semantic mapping. Experiments with heterogeneous vision transformer (ViT) encoders show that SIMs can accurately reproduce both supervised and zero-shot semantic equalizers, achieving up to 90% task accuracy in regimes with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), while maintaining strong robustness even at low SNR values."}

The former is considered to be a sign of a healthy classifier, whereas the latter is assumed to suggest overfitting on spurious correlations. A major challenge, however, is that these intuitive interpretations are difficult to test quantitatively, and hence the output of such explanations lacks an explanation itself. One particular reason is that correlations in real-world data are difficult to avoid, and whether they are spurious or legitimate is debatable. Synthetic data in turn can facilitate to actively enable or disable correlations where desired but often lack a sufficient quantification of realism and stochastic properties.

In this paper, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based medical QA system that combines domain-specific knowledge retrieval with open-source LLMs to answer medical questions. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art open LLMs (LLaMA~2 and Falcon) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient domain specialization. The system retrieves relevant medical literature to ground the LLM's answers, thereby improving factual correctness and reducing hallucinations. We evaluate the approach on benchmark datasets (PubMedQA and MedMCQA) and show that retrieval augmentation yields measurable improvements in answer accuracy compared to using LLMs alone. Our fine-tuned LLaMA~2 model achieves 71.8% accuracy on PubMedQA, substantially improving over the 55.4% zero-shot baseline, while maintaining transparency by providing source references. We also detail the system design and fine-tuning methodology, demonstrating that grounding answers in retrieved evidence reduces unsupported content by approximately 60%. These results highlight the potential of RAG-augmented open-source LLMs for reliable biomedical QA, pointing toward practical clinical informatics applications."}

Simultaneously, existing deep learning models exhibit high computational complexity, which limits their practical deployment for real-time underwater applications. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel underwater image enhancement model, called Adaptive Frequency Fusion and Illumination Aware Network (AQUA-Net). It integrates a residual encoder decoder with dual auxiliary branches, which operate in the frequency and illumination domains. The frequency fusion encoder enriches spatial representations with frequency cues from the Fourier domain and preserves fine textures and structural details. Inspired by Retinex, the illumination-aware decoder performs adaptive exposure correction through a learned illumination map that separates reflectance from lighting effects. This joint spatial, frequency, and illumination design enables the model to restore color balance, visual contrast, and perceptual realism under diverse underwater conditions. Additionally, we present a high-resolution, real-world underwater video-derived dataset from the Mediterranean Sea, which captures challenging deep-sea conditions with realistic visual degradations to enable robust evaluation and development of deep learning models. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that AQUA-Net performs on par with SOTA in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations while using less number of parameters. Ablation studies further confirm that the frequency and illumination branches provide complementary contributions that improve visibility and color representation. Overall, the proposed model shows strong generalization capability and robustness, and it provides an effective solution for real-world underwater imaging applications."}

Applying a flexible sparsity regularisation under a constrained-loss objective, we show on models up to 1B parameters that it is possible to retain the original pretraining loss while reducing attention connectivity to $\\approx 0.3 \\%$ of its edges. Unlike sparse-attention methods designed for computational efficiency, our approach leverages sparsity as a structural prior: it preserves capability while exposing a more organized and interpretable connectivity pattern. We find that this local sparsity cascades into global circuit simplification: task-specific circuits involve far fewer components (attention heads and MLPs) with up to 100x fewer edges connecting them. These results demonstrate that transformer attention can be made orders of magnitude sparser, suggesting that much of its computation is redundant and that sparsity may serve as a guiding principle for more structured and interpretable models."}

In this work, we propose a deliberative editing framework to 'think' while they edit, which simulates the human cognitive loop by iteratively executing a Think-while-Edit cycle: Critiquing results and Refining instructions , followed by Repeating the generation until satisfactory.

However, it remains an open question of how to best determine which of the many possible model checkpoints resulting from a large training run to use as the starting point. This becomes especially important when data for the target task of interest is scarce, unlabeled and out-of-distribution. In such scenarios, common methods relying on in-distribution validation data become unreliable or inapplicable. This work proposes a novel approach for model selection that operates reliably on just a few unlabeled examples from the target task. Our approach is based on a novel concept: Neural Coherence, which entails characterizing a model's activation statistics for source and target domains, allowing one to define model selection methods with high data-efficiency. We provide experiments where models are pre-trained on ImageNet1K and examine target domains consisting of Food-101, PlantNet-300K and iNaturalist. We also evaluate it in many meta-learning settings. Our approach significantly improves generalization across these different target domains compared to established baselines. We further demonstrate the versatility of Neural Coherence as a powerful principle by showing its effectiveness in training data selection."}

We argue this conclusion misidentifies the bottleneck: it confuses the ocean with the net. Pattern repositories are the necessary System-1 substrate; the missing component is a System-2 coordination layer that selects, constrains, and binds these patterns. We formalize this layer via UCCT, a theory of semantic anchoring that models reasoning as a phase transition governed by effective support (rho_d), representational mismatch (d_r), and an adaptive anchoring budget (gamma log k). Under this lens, ungrounded generation is simply an unbaited retrieval of the substrate's maximum likelihood prior, while \"reasoning\" emerges when anchors shift the posterior toward goal-directed constraints. We translate UCCT into architecture with MACI, a coordination stack that implements baiting (behavior-modulated debate), filtering (Socratic judging), and persistence (transactional memory). By reframing common objections as testable coordination failures, we argue that the path to AGI runs through LLMs, not around them."}

Despite these exceptional capabilities, controllable video models often hallucinate - generating future video frames that are misaligned with physical reality - which raises serious concerns in many tasks such as robot policy evaluation and planning. However, state-of-the-art video models lack the ability to assess and express their confidence, impeding hallucination mitigation. To rigorously address this challenge, we propose C3, an uncertainty quantification (UQ) method for training continuous-scale calibrated controllable video models for dense confidence estimation at the subpatch level, precisely localizing the uncertainty in each generated video frame. Our UQ method introduces three core innovations to empower video models to estimate their uncertainty. First, our method develops a novel framework that trains video models for correctness and calibration via strictly proper scoring rules. Second, we estimate the video model's uncertainty in latent space, avoiding training instability and prohibitive training costs associated with pixel-space approaches. Third, we map the dense latent-space uncertainty to interpretable pixel-level uncertainty in the RGB space for intuitive visualization, providing high-resolution uncertainty heatmaps that identify untrustworthy regions. Through extensive experiments on large-scale robot learning datasets (Bridge and DROID) and real-world evaluations, we demonstrate that our method not only provides calibrated uncertainty estimates within the training distribution, but also enables effective out-of-distribution detection."}

A promising alternative, latent visual reasoning, circumvents this bottleneck yet currently forces a critical trade-off: methods either sacrifice precise perceptual modeling by over-compressing features or fail to model dynamic problems due to static, non-interleaved structures. We introduce Interleaved Latent Visual Reasoning (ILVR), a framework that unifies dynamic state evolution with precise perceptual modeling. ILVR interleaves textual generation with latent visual representations that act as specific, evolving cues for subsequent reasoning. To enable this, we employ a self-supervision strategy where a Momentum Teacher Model selectively distills relevant features from helper images into sparse supervision targets. This adaptive selection mechanism guides the model to autonomously generate context-aware visual signals. Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ILVR significantly outperforms existing approaches, effectively bridging the gap between fine-grained perception and sequential multimodal reasoning."}

Combined with ground truth information about the location of the object in the input image (e.g., a binary mask), it is determined whether object pixels had a high impact on the classification result, or whether the classification focused on background pixels. The former is considered to be a sign of a healthy classifier, whereas the latter is assumed to suggest overfitting on spurious correlations. A major challenge, however, is that these intuitive interpretations are difficult to test quantitatively, and hence the output of such explanations lacks an explanation itself. One particular reason is that correlations in real-world data are difficult to avoid, and whether they are spurious or legitimate is debatable. Synthetic data in turn can facilitate to actively enable or disable correlations where desired but often lack a sufficient quantification of realism and stochastic properties. [...] Therefore, we systematically generate six synthetic datasets for the task of traffic sign recognition, which differ only in their degree of camera variation and background correlation [...] to quantify the isolated influence of background correlation, different levels of camera variation, and considered traffic sign shapes on the classification performance, as well as background feature importance.

However, transforming the resulting high-dimensional data into interpretable deformation pattern maps remains a resource-intensive and largely manual process. In this work, we introduce a data-driven workflow that automates this interpretation step using unsupervised and supervised learning. Grain-orientation-colored computational tomograph pictures obtained from CuNi alloy simulations were first compressed through an autoencoder to a 32-dimensional global feature vector. Despite this strong compression, the reconstructed images retained the essential microstructural motifs: grain boundaries, stacking faults, twins, and partial lattice rotations, while omitting only the finest defects. The learned representations were then combined with simulation metadata (composition, load, time, temperature, and spatial position) to train a CNN-MLP model to predict the dominant deformation pattern. The resulting model achieves a prediction accuracy of approximately 96% on validation data. A refined evaluation strategy, in which an entire spatial region containing distinct grains was excluded from training, provides a more robust measure of generalization. The approach demonstrates that essential tribological deformation signatures can be automatically identified and classified from structural images using Machine Learning. This proof of concept constitutes a first step towards fully automated, data-driven construction of tribological mechanism maps and, ultimately, toward predictive modeling frameworks that may reduce the need for large-scale MD simulation campaigns."}

To address these limitations, we propose Neural Implicit Craniofacial Model (NICE) which employs implicit neural representations for accurate anatomical reconstruction and surgical outcome prediction. NICE comprises a shape module, which employs region-specific implicit Signed Distance Function (SDF) decoders to reconstruct the facial surface, maxilla, and mandible, and a surgery module, which employs region-specific deformation decoders. These deformation decoders are driven by a shared surgical latent code to effectively model the complex, nonlinear biomechanical response of the facial surface to skeletal movements, incorporating anatomical prior knowledge. The deformation decoders output point-wise displacement fields, enabling precise modeling of surgical outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NICE outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, notably improving prediction accuracy in critical facial regions such as lips and chin, while robustly preserving anatomical integrity.

Standard imputation methods such as regression models, expectation-maximization, and multiple imputation rely on strong assumptions about linearity and independence. These assumptions rarely hold for complex or heterogeneous data, which can lead to biased or over-smoothed estimates. We propose Impugan, a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) for imputing missing values and integrating heterogeneous datasets. The model is trained on complete samples to learn how missing variables depend on observed ones. During inference, the generator reconstructs missing entries from available features, and the discriminator enforces realism by distinguishing true from imputed data. This adversarial process allows Impugan to capture nonlinear and multimodal relationships that conventional methods cannot represent. In experiments on benchmark datasets and a multi-source integration task, Impugan achieves up to 82\\% lower Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) and 70\\% lower mutual-information deviation (MI) compared to leading baselines.

To sustain this ecosystem, we need fair mechanisms to attribute and compensate content providers based on their contributions to generated answers. We introduce MaxShapley, an efficient algorithm for fair attribution in generative search pipelines that use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). MaxShapley is a special case of the celebrated Shapley value; it leverages a decomposable max-sum utility function to compute attributions with linear computation in the number of documents, as opposed to the exponential cost of Shapley values. We evaluate MaxShapley on three multi-hop QA datasets (HotPotQA, MuSiQUE, MS MARCO); MaxShapley achieves comparable attribution quality to exact Shapley computation, while consuming a fraction of its tokens--for instance, it gives up to an 8x reduction in resource consumption over prior state-of-the-art methods at the same attribution accuracy."}

However, they lack a grounded understanding of physical dynamics. This limitation arises from training VLMs on static internet-scale visual-language data that contain no causal interactions or action-conditioned changes. Consequently, it remains challenging to leverage VLMs for fine-grained robotic manipulation tasks that require physical understanding, reasoning, and corresponding action planning. To overcome this, we present SIMPACT, a test-time, SIMulation-enabled ACTion Planning framework that equips VLMs with physical reasoning through simulation-in-the-loop world modeling, without requiring any additional training. From a single RGB-D observation, SIMPACT efficiently constructs physics simulations, enabling the VLM to propose informed actions, observe simulated rollouts, and iteratively refine its reasoning. By integrating language reasoning with physics prediction, our simulation-enabled VLM can understand contact dynamics and action outcomes in a physically grounded way. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on five challenging, real-world rigid-body and deformable manipulation tasks that require fine-grained physical reasoning, outperforming existing general-purpose robotic manipulation models. Our results demonstrate that embedding physics understanding via efficient simulation into VLM reasoning at test time offers a promising path towards generalizable embodied intelligence.

Simultaneously, existing deep learning models exhibit high computational complexity, which limits their practical deployment for real-time underwater applications. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel underwater image enhancement model, called Adaptive Frequency Fusion and Illumination Aware Network (AQUA-Net). It integrates a residual encoder decoder with dual auxiliary branches, which operate in the frequency and illumination domains. The frequency fusion encoder enriches spatial representations with frequency cues from the Fourier domain and preserves fine textures and structural details. Inspired by Retinex, the illumination-aware decoder performs adaptive exposure correction through a learned illumination map that separates reflectance from lighting effects. This joint spatial, frequency, and illumination design enables the model to restore color balance, visual contrast, and perceptual realism under diverse underwater conditions. Additionally, we present a high-resolution, real-world underwater video-derived dataset from the Mediterranean Sea, which captures challenging deep-sea conditions with realistic visual degradations to enable robust evaluation and development of deep learning models. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that AQUA-Net performs on par with SOTA in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations while using less number of parameters. Ablation studies further confirm that the frequency and illumination branches provide complementary contributions that improve visibility and color representation. Overall, the proposed model shows strong generalization capability and robustness, and it provides an effective solution for real-world underwater imaging applications."}

However, growing evidence shows that models trained in such way often suffer from a significant loss in diversity. We argue that this arises because RL implicitly optimizes the \"mode-seeking\" or \"zero-forcing\" Reverse KL to a target distribution causing the model to concentrate mass on certain high-probability regions of the target while neglecting others. In this work, we instead begin from an explicit target distribution, obtained by filtering out incorrect answers while preserving the relative probabilities of correct ones. Starting from a pre-trained LLM, we approximate this target distribution using the $α$-divergence family, which unifies prior approaches and enables direct control of the precision-diversity trade-off by interpolating between mode-seeking and mass-covering divergences. On a Lean theorem-proving benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance along the coverage-precision Pareto frontier, outperforming all prior methods on the coverage axis."}

However, this inpainting method introduces computational overhead that increases inference latency. In this work, we propose a simple alternative: simulating inference delay at training time and conditioning on action prefixes directly, eliminating any inference-time overhead. Our method requires no modifications to the model architecture or robot runtime, and can be implemented with only a few additional lines of code. In simulated experiments, we find that training-time RTC outperforms inference-time RTC at higher inference delays. In real-world experiments on box building and espresso making tasks with the $π_{0.6}$ VLA, we demonstrate that training-time RTC maintains both task performance and speed parity with inference-time RTC while being computationally cheaper. Our results suggest that training-time action conditioning is a practical drop-in replacement for inference-time inpainting in real-time robot control."}
