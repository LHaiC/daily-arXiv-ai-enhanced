We investigate whether symmetry constraints can\nprevent this phenomenon. We prove that strongly symmetric thermal states\n(canonical ensemble) of generic Hamiltonians with on-site Abelian symmetries\nremain entangled with non-zero entanglement negativity at arbitrarily high\ntemperatures, under mild conditions on the symmetry actions and the charge\nsector of the strong symmetry. Our results extend to weakly symmetric thermal\nstates (Gibbs ensemble) under superselection rules, which restrict state\ndecompositions to be symmetric. In particular, we show that fermionic Gibbs\nstates do not exhibit sudden death of entanglement and have persistent\nfermionic negativity at high temperatures. These findings demonstrate that\nglobal symmetry correlations can preserve quantum entanglement despite thermal\ndecoherence, providing new insights into the interplay between symmetry and\nquantum information in thermal equilibrium."}

In our model, individuals in a\npopulation deploy a variety of unbiased and biased level-k reasoning strategies\nto anticipate others' behaviour in sequential interactions, represented by the\nIncremental Centipede Game. Positively biased reasoning strategies have a\nsystematic inference bias towards higher but uncertain rewards, while\nnegatively biased strategies reflect the opposite tendency.

This bias co-evolves with bounded rationality, as\nthe reasoning depth remains limited in the population.

Our\nmethod integrates two key components: (1) a novelty scoring system that\nevaluates the uniqueness of experimental results, and (2) a strategic sampling\nmechanism that promotes exploration of under-sampled regions even if they\nappear less promising by conventional criteria. We validate this approach on a\npre-acquired dataset with a known ground truth comprising of image-spectral\npairs. We further implement the process on autonomous scanning probe microscopy\nexperiments. INS2ANE significantly increases the diversity of explored\nphenomena in comparison to conventional optimization routines, enhancing the\nlikelihood of discovering previously unobserved phenomena. These results\ndemonstrate the potential for AE to enhance the depth of scientific discovery;\nin combination with the efficiency provided by AEs, this approach promises to\naccelerate scientific research by simultaneously navigating complex\nexperimental spaces to uncover new phenomena."}

This work demonstrates that adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG\ncan be readily applied to modern machine learning approaches, with potential to\nimprove performance. It is a promising alternative to fixed-length segmentation\nfor signal preprocessing and should be considered as part of the standard\npreprocessing repertoire in EEG machine learning applications."}

Experiments show that TCIA improves open-source LLMs' performance\nby an average of 8.7% across four real-world, task-specific applications, and\nin some cases outperforming leading closed-source models. These improvements do\nnot compromise general instruction-following ability, making TCIA a scalable\nand efficient solution for adapting LLMs to real-world, task-focused\napplications."}

However, one key limitation of BB codes is their high qubit\nconnectivity degree requirements (degree 6), which exacerbates the noise\nsusceptibility of the system. Building on the recent progress in implementing\nmultiple two-qubit gates on a single chip, this work introduces Louvre -- a\nrouting-based framework designed to reduce qubit connectivity requirements in\nGB codes. Specifically, Louvre-7 achieves degree reduction while preserving the\ndepth of the syndrome extraction circuit, whereas Louvre-8 further minimizes\nthe connectivity by slightly increasing the circuit depth. When applied to BB\ncodes, these two schemes could reduce the average degree to 4.5 and 4,\nrespectively.

Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations\ncharacterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and\nvarying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning\n(RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and\nconvergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional\ntimetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key\ninnovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by\naugmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station\nID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy,\nvelocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to\ncapture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs\ninto a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function\naligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway\ndeviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule\nadherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves\nmore stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g.,\n-430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions).

To address these problems, we propose a\ndescriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core\nidea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based\ntext-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained\nText-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion.\nSpecifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a\nCross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference\nimage features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its\ntext-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction\ndataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other\nextensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it\nimproves editing accuracy and consistency."}

In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines\nto promote the development of trustworthy AI.

To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of\nguideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby\ntesting whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly\nviolate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses\nthat do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of\n``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that\nprovoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying\npotential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method\nfinally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence\nand highlighting any violations.\n  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs,\nincluding Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4,\nGPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued\nguidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics.

However,\nensuring high-quality service for real-time edge systems is a significant\nchallenge due to the considerable computational demands and resource\nrequirements of these models. Existing strategies typically either offload\ntransformer computations to other devices or directly deploy compressed models\non individual edge devices. These strategies, however, result in either\nconsiderable communication overhead or suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy\nand efficiency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a collaborative\ninference system for general transformer models, termed CoFormer. The central\nidea behind CoFormer is to exploit the divisibility and integrability of\ntransformer. An off-the-shelf large transformer can be decomposed into multiple\nsmaller models for distributed inference, and their intermediate results are\naggregated to generate the final output. We formulate an optimization problem\nto minimize both inference latency and accuracy degradation under heterogeneous\nhardware constraints. DeBo algorithm is proposed to first solve the\noptimization problem to derive the decomposition policy, and then progressively\ncalibrate decomposed models to restore performance. We demonstrate the\ncapability to support a wide range of transformer models on heterogeneous edge\ndevices, achieving up to 3.1$\\times$ inference speedup with large transformer\nmodels.

Recent research has\ndemonstrated that these safety mechanisms can be bypassed by ablating or\nremoving specific representational directions within the model. In this paper,\nwe propose the opposite approach: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box\nmethod that amplifies a model's safety alignment by permanently steering its\nactivations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. ROSI operates as a simple,\nfine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream\nwrite matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set\nof harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently\nincreases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while\npreserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU,\nHellaSwag, and Arc. Furthermore, we show that ROSI can also re-align\n'uncensored' models by amplifying their own latent safety directions,\ndemonstrating its utility as an effective last-mile safety procedure.

To address this challenge, we\nintroduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily\navailable web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images\nfrom the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a\nsimpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization.\nSpecifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and\naccurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level.

Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a\nlarge-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually\nforged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than\nexisting handcrafted datasets like IMD20.

We present the winning\nsolution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge, which\nstress-tests watermark robustness under varying degrees of adversary knowledge.\nThe challenge consisted of two tracks: a black-box and beige-box track,\ndepending on whether the adversary knows which watermarking method was used by\nthe provider. For the beige-box track, we leverage an adaptive VAE-based\nevasion attack, with a test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in\nCIELAB space to preserve the image's quality. For the black-box track, we first\ncluster images based on their artifacts in the spatial or frequency-domain.\nThen, we apply image-to-image diffusion models with controlled noise injection\nand semantic priors from ChatGPT-generated captions to each cluster with\noptimized parameter settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method\nsuccessfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible\nimpact on the residual image's quality. We hope that our attacks inspire the\ndevelopment of more robust image watermarking methods."}

Methods: This study introduces SNNDeep, the first\ntailored SNN specifically optimized for binary classification of liver health\nstatus from computed tomography (CT) features. To ensure clinical relevance and\nbroad generalizability, the model was developed and evaluated using the\nTask03\\Liver dataset from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD), a\nstandardized benchmark widely used for assessing performance across diverse\nmedical imaging tasks. We benchmark three fundamentally different learning\nalgorithms, namely Surrogate Gradient Learning, the Tempotron rule, and\nBio-Inspired Active Learning across three architectural variants: a fully\ncustomized low-level model built from scratch, and two implementations using\nleading SNN frameworks, i.e., snnTorch and SpikingJelly.

In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines\nto promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are\ntypically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in\ntranslating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.\n  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\\textbf{G}uideline\n\\textbf{U}pholding Test through \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{R}ole-play and\nJailbreak \\textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize\nguidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM\nadherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of\nguideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby\ntesting whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly\nviolate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses\nthat do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of\n``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that\nprovoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying\npotential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method\nfinally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence\nand highlighting any violations.\n  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs,\nincluding Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4,\nGPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued\nguidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can\ntransfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its\nusage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications."}

This is a preprint version. 14 pages, 6\n  figures", "summary": "We investigated the adaptation and performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs)\nwith Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for self-supervised representation\nlearning on one-dimensional (1D) ultrasound signals. Although MAEs have\ndemonstrated significant success in computer vision and other domains, their\nuse for 1D signal analysis, especially for raw ultrasound data, remains largely\nunexplored. Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as\nnon-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where\nlabeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We\npropose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic\nultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that\nenhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF)\nclassification. This study systematically investigated the impact of model\nsize, patch size, and masking ratio on pre-training efficiency and downstream\naccuracy. Our results show that pre-trained models significantly outperform\nmodels trained from scratch and strong convolutional neural network (CNN)\nbaselines optimized for the downstream task.

However, scaling diffusion transformers to generate long-context\nvideos is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which\nmakes memory and computation intractable and difficult to optimize for long\nsequences. We recast long-context video generation as an internal information\nretrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module,\nMixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine.\nIn MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory\nanchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that\nprevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the\nrouting, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities,\nactions, and scenes over minutes of content. Efficiency follows as a byproduct\nof retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and\nsynthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes."}
