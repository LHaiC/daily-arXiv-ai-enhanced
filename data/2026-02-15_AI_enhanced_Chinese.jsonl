The simplest mode of non-convergence is cyclical or periodic behavior. Such cycles are fundamental objects, and have inspired a number of significant insights in the field, beginning with the pioneering work of Shapley (1964). However a central question remains unanswered: which cycles are stable under game dynamics? In this paper we give a complete and computational answer to this question for the two best-studied dynamics, fictitious play/best-response dynamics and the replicator dynamic. We show (1) that a periodic sequence of profiles is stable under one of these dynamics if and only it is stable under the other, and (2) we provide a polynomial-time spectral stability test to determine whether a given periodic sequence is stable under either dynamic. Finally, we give an entirely `structural' sufficient condition for stability: every cycle that is a sink equilibrium of the preference graph of the game is stable, and moreover it is an attractor of the replicator dynamic. This result generalizes the famous theorems of Shapley (1964) and Jordan (1993), and extends the frontier of recent work relating the preference graph to the replicator attractors.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Focusing on whole-brain Dynamic Mean Field (DMF) models, a baseline where 20 parameters were shared across the brain was compared against a heterogeneous formulation where different sets of 20 parameters were used for the seven canonical brain regions. The heterogeneous model was optimized using four strategies: optimizing all parameters at once, a curricular approach following the hierarchy of brain networks (HICO), a reversed curricular approach, and a randomly shuffled curricular approach. While all heterogeneous strategies fit the data well, only curricular approaches generalized to new subjects. Most importantly, only HICO made it possible to use the parameter sets to predict the subjects' behavioral abilities as well.

The methodology involves embedding the trained neural network into the system's dynamical equations, rendering the closed-loop system autonomous. The system flow is then approximated by high-order Taylor polynomials, which are subsequently manipulated to construct polynomial maps that project state uncertainties onto an event manifold. Automatic domain splitting ensures the polynomials are accurate over their relevant subdomains, whilst also allowing an extensive state-space to be analysed efficiently.

Conventional models distinguish between trion-related A-type blinking and defect-assisted BC-type blinking, both expected to degrade single-photon purity in a dark state. Here, time-resolved spectroscopy on individual PQDs reveals a qualitatively different regime in which low emitting dark states exhibit higher single-photon purity than bright states. For those PQDs state-resolved $g^{(2)}(\u03c4)$ analysis shows that the exciton photoluminescence quantum yield decreases by a factor of $\\sim 8$, while the biexciton one is suppressed by a factor of $\\sim 10$. This leads to a moderate improvement of single-photon purity with $g^{(2)}_0$ decreased from 0.155 to 0.120. In contrast, PQDs with fluorescence lifetime--intensity distribution patterns characteristic for A-type blinking, display the expected increase of $g^{(2)}_0$ in charged, trion-dominated states. To explain the observed improvement of single-photon purity of low-emitting dark states, we propose a self-trapped-exciton (STE) mechanism that selectively blocks biexciton formation by diverting hot excitons into long-lived, weakly emissive STE configurations.

This has been studied extensively under the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) formulation, which reduces the problem to finding some type of Steiner subgraph on a network. Group surveillance like wastewater or aerosol monitoring is a form of mass/pooled testing where samples from multiple individuals are pooled together and tested once for all. While a single negative test clears multiple individuals, a positive test does not reveal the infected individuals in the test pool. We introduce the POOLCASCADEMLE problem in the setting of a network propagation process, where the goal is to find a MLE cascade subgraph which is consistent with the pooled test outcomes. Previous work on reconstruction assumes that the test results are of individuals, i.e., pools of size one, and requires a consistent cascade to connect the positive testing nodes. In POOLCASCADEMLE, a consistent cascade must choose at least one node in each positive pool, adding another combinatorial layer. We show that, under the Independent Cascade (IC) model, POOLCASCADEMLE is NP-hard, and present an approximation algorithm based on a reduction to the Group Steiner Tree problem. We also consider a one-hop version of this problem, in which the disease can spread for one time step after being seeded. We show that even this restricted version is NP-hard, and develop a method using linear programming relaxation and rounding.

Verified reasoning is an important goal in high-stakes scenarios such as deploying agents in the physical world or in domains such as law and finance. However, current techniques either rely on the generate-test paradigm that verifies only after the final answer is produced, or verify partial output through a step-extraction paradigm where the task execution is externally broken down into structured steps. The former is inefficient while the latter artificially restricts a model's problem solving strategies. Instead, we propose to verify a model's reasoning trace as-is, taking full advantage of a model's reasoning capabilities while verifying and steering the model's output only when needed.

This assumption -- that useful memories are similar memories -- fails to capture a fundamental property of biological memory: association through temporal co-occurrence. We propose Predictive Associative Memory (PAM), an architecture in which a JEPA-style predictor, trained on temporal co-occurrence within a continuous experience stream, learns to navigate the associative structure of an embedding space. We introduce an Inward JEPA that operates over stored experience (predicting associatively reachable past states) as the complement to the standard Outward JEPA that operates over incoming sensory data (predicting future states). We evaluate PAM as an associative recall system -- testing faithfulness of recall for experienced associations -- rather than as a retrieval system evaluated on generalisation to unseen associations. On a synthetic benchmark, the predictor's top retrieval is a true temporal associate 97% of the time (Association Precision@1 = 0.970); it achieves cross-boundary Recall@20 = 0.421 where cosine similarity scores zero; and it separates experienced-together from never-experienced-together states with a discrimination AUC of 0.916 (cosine: 0.789). Even restricted to cross-room pairs where embedding similarity is uninformative, the predictor achieves AUC = 0.849 (cosine: 0.503, chance).

To address these challenges, we present VF-Editor, which enables native editing of Gaussian primitives by predicting attribute variations in a feedforward manner. To accurately and efficiently estimate these variations, we design a novel variation predictor distilled from 2D editing knowledge. The predictor encodes the input to generate a variation field and employs two learnable, parallel decoding functions to iteratively infer attribute changes for each 3D Gaussian. Thanks to its unified design, VF-Editor can seamlessly distill editing knowledge from diverse 2D editors and strategies into a single predictor, allowing for flexible and effective knowledge transfer into the 3D domain.

Adding calibrated random noise before communication to satisfy differential privacy offers a proven defense; however, most existing methods are tailored to specific downstream tasks and lack a general, protocol-level privacy-preserving solution. To bridge this gap, we propose Differentially Private Perturbed Push-Sum (DPPS), a lightweight differential privacy protocol for decentralized communication. Since protocol-level differential privacy introduces the unique challenge of obtaining the sensitivity for each communication round, DPPS introduces a novel sensitivity estimation mechanism that requires each node to compute and broadcast only one scalar per round, enabling rigorous differential privacy guarantees. This design allows DPPS to serve as a plug-and-play, low-cost privacy-preserving solution for downstream applications built on it. To provide a concrete instantiation of DPPS and better balance the privacy-utility trade-off, we design PartPSP, a privacy-preserving decentralized algorithm for non-convex optimization that integrates a partial communication mechanism. By partitioning model parameters into local and shared components and applying DPPS only to the shared parameters, PartPSP reduces the dimensionality of consensus data, thereby lowering the magnitude of injected noise and improving optimization performance. We theoretically prove that PartPSP converges under non-convex objectives and, with partial communication, achieves better optimization performance under the same privacy budget.

Our algorithms are given in two new computational models: tape machines and deque machines. We also study more restricted models, queue machines and stack machines, and show that they cannot enumerate all binary words with constant auxiliary space, even with unrestricted delay.\n  A tape machine is a Turing machine that stores the current binary word on a single working tape of length $\\ell$. The machine has a single head and must edit its tape to reach all possible words of $\\{0,1\\}^{\\ell}$ , and output them (in unit time, by entering special output states), with no duplicates. We construct a tape machine that achieves this task with constant delay between consecutive outputs, which implies that the machine implements a so-called skew-tolerant quasi-Gray code. We then construct a more involved tape machine that implements a Gray code.\n  A deque machine stores the current binary word on a double-ended queue of length $\\ell$, and stores a constant-size internal state. It works as a tape machine, except that it modifies the content of the deque by performing push and pop operations on the endpoints. We construct deque machines that enumerate all words of $\\{0,1\\}^\\ell$ with constant-delay.

This assumption is inconsistent with state-resolved optical pumping experiments and basic spectroscopic constraints. Here we present a microscopic theory of optical gain explicitly anchored in the Einstein relations governing absorption and stimulated emission. Within this framework, gain is determined by a spectral balance between stimulated emission from single excitons and excited-state absorption into biexcitonic manifolds, rather than by biexciton lifetimes. Using a spin-boson description of excitons coupled to a lattice bath, we show that gain thresholds and effective gain cross sections are controlled by the interplay of biexciton stabilization and exciton-lattice dressing.

To address the large-signal system strength assessment, a control type-dependent metric, Power Margin Ratio (PMR), is proposed in this paper. PMR is defined as the ratio between the maximum power that can be injected to the system without causing any instability and the nominal power of the IBR.

In real-world driving environments, radar signals often undergo multipath propagation due to reflections from surfaces such as guardrails. These indirect paths can produce ghost targets - false detections that appear at incorrect locations - posing challenges to autonomous navigation. A recent method, the Multi-Path Iterative Adaptive Approach (MP-IAA), addresses this by jointly estimating the DOA/DOD angle grid, identifying mismatches as indicators of ghost targets. However, its effectiveness declines in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) settings. To enhance robustness, we introduce a physics-inspired regularizer that captures structural patterns inherent to multipath propagation. This regularizer is incorporated into the estimation cost, forming a new loss function that guides our proposed algorithm, TIGRE (Target-Induced angle-Grid Regularized Estimation). TIGRE iteratively minimizes this regularized loss and we show that our proposed regularizer asymptotically enforces L0 sparsity on the DOA/DOD grid.

Prior work on reward learning from human videos attempts to measure the long-term value of a visual state as the temporal distance between it and the terminal state in a demonstration video. These approaches make assumptions that limit performance when learning from video. They must also transfer the learned value function across the embodiment and environment gap. Our method models human preferences by learning to predict the motion of tracked points between subsequent images and defines a reward function as the agreement between predicted and observed object motion in a robot's behavior at each step. We then use a modified Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm initialized with 10 on-robot demonstrations to estimate a value function from this reward and optimize a policy that maximizes this value function, all on the robot. Our approach is capable of learning on a real robot, and we show that policies learned with our reward model match or outperform prior work across multiple tasks in both simulation and on the real robot.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We study a defensive setting in which a data publisher (defender) seeks to conceal a community of interest while making limited, utility-aware changes in the network. Our analysis indicates that community concealment is strongly influenced by two quantifiable factors: connectivity at the community boundary and feature similarity between the protected community and adjacent communities.

The proposed method outperforms DICE in our experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real network graphs under identical perturbation budgets.

Even compounds with nominal Au2+ usually disproportionate into Au1+ and Au3+. Recently, Cs4Au3Cl12 was synthesized, where gold took the 2+ state in the bulk. Here, we investigate this compound using first-principles calculations and show that stabilization of the Au2+ ion is through the formation of a polaron crystal. The electronic and phononic structure suggest that the bonding network can be interpreted as a collection of [Au2+Cl4]2- and [Au3+Cl4]1- square planar motifs, and the crystal lacks a smooth pathway for Au2+ to disproportionate into Au1+ and Au3+. The electronic states of Au are contained within each [AuCl4] motif, which allows for the Au2+ state to be localized and isolated electronically. The Au2+-sites form an ordered structure, which is driven by a strong repulsive interaction between [Au2+Cl4]2- motifs due to their lattice distortion. The electron-phonon coupling between Au2+ and Cl explains the stability of Au2+, which suggests this material to be interpreted as a polaron crystal. By considering redox reaction, we show that Cs4Au3Cl12 has the maximal density of Au2+, and further oxidation will induce a delocalized state. Cs4Au3Cl12 has distinctive electronic structure, with a narrow gap, isolated HOMO and LUMO bands strongly localized at the Au-sites, and magnetization at the Au2+-sites making Cs4Au3Cl12 unique among quantum materials. Magnetism in gold is rare, and Cs4Au3Cl12 can be a testbed to explore novel gold chemistry as well as polaron crystal transport.

We introduce DEpiABS, a scalable, differentiable agent-based model (DABM) that balances mechanistic detail, computational efficiency and interpretability. DEpiABS captures individual-level heterogeneity in health status, behaviour, and resource constraints, while also modelling epidemic processes like viral mutation and reinfection dynamics. The model is fully differentiable, enabling fast simulation and gradient-based parameter calibration. Building on this foundation, we introduce a z-score-based scaling method that maps small-scale simulations to any real-world population sizes with negligible loss in output granularity, reducing the computational burden when modelling large populations. We validate DEpiABS through sensitivity analysis and calibration to COVID-19 and flu data from ten regions of varying scales. Compared to the baseline, DEpiABS is more detailed, fully interpretable, and has reduced the average normal deviation in forecasting from 0.97 to 0.92 on COVID-19 mortality data and from 0.41 to 0.32 on influenza-like-illness data.

Yet, almost all fast convergence guarantees in learning in games require prior knowledge of the utility scale. To address this, we develop learning dynamics that achieve fast convergence while being both scale-free, requiring no prior information about utilities, and scale-invariant, remaining unchanged under positive rescaling of utilities. For two-player zero-sum games, we obtain scale-free and scale-invariant dynamics with external regret bounded by $\\tilde{O}(A_{\\mathrm{diff}})$, where $A_{\\mathrm{diff}}$ is the payoff range, which implies an $\\tilde{O}(A_{\\mathrm{diff}} / T)$ convergence rate to Nash equilibrium after $T$ rounds.

This yields an $O(U_{\\mathrm{max}} \\log T / T)$ convergence rate to correlated equilibrium. Our learning dynamics are based on optimistic follow-the-regularized-leader with an adaptive learning rate that incorporates the squared path length of the opponents' gradient vectors, together with a new stopping-time analysis that exploits negative terms in regret bounds without scale-dependent tuning.

To address these limitations, we introduce TexSpot, a diffusion-based texture enhancement framework. At its core is Texlet, a novel 3D texture representation that merges the geometric expressiveness of point-based 3D textures with the compactness of UV-based representation.

High-level planning treats LIOS actions as deterministic and so -- informed by model-based calculations of the expected cost of each -- generates plans that interleave search and execution for effective, sound, and complete learning-informed task planning despite uncertainty.

The most consistent assumption is that parties do not have access to a global clock, only their local time since wake-up. This is surprising because the assumption of a global clock is both technologically realistic and algorithmically interesting. It enriches the problem, and opens the door to entirely new techniques.

Our primal-dual algorithm is in the spirit of the work Buchbinder, Kimbrel, Levi, Makarychev, and Sviridenko, which maintains a wavefront dual solution to decide when to place an order and which items to order. The main twist is in deciding which requests to serve early. In contrast to the work of Moseley et al., which ranks early requests in ascending order of desired service time and serves them until their total holding cost matches the ordering cost incurred for that item, we extend to the non-uniform case by instead ranking in ascending order of when the delay cost of a demand would reach its current holding cost. An important special case of the JRP is the single-item lot-sizing problem. Here, Moseley et al. gave a 3-competitive algorithm when the holding and delay costs are uniform across demands.

Unfortunately, for regular distributions, adding $m$ additional buyers is sometimes indeed necessary, so the \"competition complexity\" of the VCG auction is $m$. We seek proving better competition complexity results in two dimensions.\n  First, under stronger distributional assumptions, the competition complexity of VCG auction drops dramatically. In balanced markets (where $m=n$) with MHR distributions, it is sufficient to only add $(e^{1/e} - 1 + o(1))n \\approx 0.4447n$ additional buyers to match the optimal revenue -- less than half the number that is necessary under regularity -- and this bound is asymptotically tight. We provide both exact finite-market results for small value of $n$, and closed-form asymptotic formulas for general market with any $m\\leq n$, and any target fraction of the optimal revenue.\n  Second, we analyze a supply-limiting variant of VCG auction that caps the number of units sold in a prior-independent way.

The resulting ``Helical Metal'' has a complex spin-texture beyond a simple Rashba splitting.

To address this challenge, we develop an alternating-optimization (AO) framework that alternates between a closed-form maximum-ratio-transmission (MRT) update at the BS and an {optimal} FRIS-configuration update. The key step of the proposed FRIS configuration is a Minkowski-geometry reformulation of the FRIS codebook superposition: by convexifying the feasible reflected-sum set and exploiting support-function identities, we convert the FRIS subproblem into a one-dimensional maximization over a directional parameter. For each direction, the optimal configuration is obtained constructively via per-port directional scoring, Top-$M_o$ port selection, and optimal codeword assignment. For the practically important regular $M_p$-gon phase-shifter codebook, we further derive closed-form score expressions and establish a piecewise-smooth structure of the resulting support function, which leads to a finite critical-angle search that provably identifies the global optimum without exhaustive angular sweeping.

To address these issues, we propose ReaDy-Go, a novel real-to-sim simulation pipeline that synthesizes photorealistic dynamic scenarios for target environments. ReaDy-Go generates photorealistic navigation datasets for dynamic environments by combining a reconstructed static GS scene with dynamic human GS obstacles, and trains policies robust to both the sim-to-real gap and moving obstacles.

ReaDy-Go outperforms baselines across target environments in both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating improved navigation performance even after sim-to-real transfer and in the presence of moving obstacles.

In this article, a unified analytical framework is proposed to characterize the maintainability of PASS. Within this framework, random waveguide failures and repairs are modeled by treating the waveguide lifetime and repair time as exponentially distributed random variables, which are characterized by the failure rate and the repair rate, respectively. The operational state of the waveguide is described by a two-state continuous-time Markov chain, for which the transition probabilities and steady-state probabilities of the waveguide being working or failed are analyzed. By incorporating the randomness of the waveguide operational state into the transmission rate, system maintainability is characterized using the probability of non-zero rate (PNR) and outage probability (OP). The proposed framework is applied to both a conventional PASS employing a single long waveguide and a segmented waveguide-enabled pinching-antenna system (SWAN) composed of multiple short waveguide segments under two operational protocols: segment switching (SS) and segment aggregation (SA). Closed-form expressions for the PNR and OP are derived for both architectures, and the corresponding scaling laws are analyzed with respect to the service-region size and the number of segments. It is proven that both SS-based and SA-based SWAN achieve higher PNR and lower OP than conventional PASS, which confirms the maintainability advantage of segmentation.

Also, we model the residual information that is hard to linguistically describe in the prompt with an additional learnable token. This aids BO to sample more high-performing hyperparameters. In addition, by leveraging the observation of the strong correlation between the respective performance obtained from full and subset training datasets in LoRA training regimes, we introduce proxy training and evaluation with a data subset.

However, because general anonymous contracts can suffer from multiple equilibria with unbounded gaps in principal utility, we identify uniform anonymous contracts as a desirable subclass. We prove that uniform anonymous contracts guarantee a unique equilibrium, thereby providing robust performance guarantees.\n  In terms of efficiency, we prove that under limited liability, anonymous contracts cannot generally approximate the social welfare better than a factor logarithmic in the spread of agent success probabilities. We show that uniform contracts are sufficient to match this theoretical limit. Finally, we demonstrate that removing limited liability significantly boosts performance: anonymous contracts generally achieve an $O(\\log n)$ approximation to the social welfare and, surprisingly, can extract the full welfare whenever agents' success probabilities are distinct. This reveals a structural reversal: widely spread probabilities are the hardest case under limited liability, whereas identical probabilities become the hardest case when limited liability is removed.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This study aims to increase the similarity between robot and human gaze behavior across various social situations, including both human and non-human stimuli (e.g., conversations, pointing, door openings, and object drops). A key innovation in this study, is the investigation of gaze responses to non-human stimuli, a critical yet underexplored area in prior research. These scenarios, were simulated in the Unity software as a 3D animation and a 360-degree real-world video. Data on gaze directions from 41 participants were collected via virtual reality (VR) glasses. Preprocessed data, trained two neural networks-LSTM and Transformer-to build predictive models based on individuals' gaze patterns. In the animated scenario, the LSTM and Transformer models achieved prediction accuracies of 67.6% and 70.4%, respectively; In the real-world scenario, the LSTM and Transformer models achieved accuracies of 72% and 71.6%, respectively. Despite the gaze pattern differences among individuals, our models outperform existing approaches in accuracy while uniquely considering non-human stimuli, offering a significant advantage over previous literature.

Realizing this requires low photon-loss rates and qubits with tunable electric dipole moments that couple strongly to the resonator's electric field while maintaining long coherence times. For spin qubits, spin-photon coupling is typically achieved via spin-charge hybridization. However, this introduces a fundamental trade-off: a large spin-charge admixture enhances the coupling strength, which boosts readout and resonator-mediated gate speeds, but exposes the qubit to increased decoherence, thereby increasing the threshold required for strong coupling and limiting the time available for accurate state measurement. This makes it essential to identify optimal operating points for each qubit platform. We address this for the donor-based flip-flop qubit, whose microwave-controllable electron-nuclear spin states make it suitable for coupling to microwave resonators. We demonstrate that, by choosing intermediate tunnel couplings that balance strong interaction with long qubit lifetimes, high-fidelity readout and strong coupling are simultaneously achievable. We also map out the respective charge-photon couplings and photon-loss rates required.

However, conventional SIM designs rely on rigid planar layers with fixed interlayer spacing, which constrain the propagation geometry and can lead to performance saturation as the number of layers increases. This paper investigates the potential of introducing structural flexibility into SIM-enabled communication systems. Specifically, we consider two flexible SIM architectures: distance-adaptive SIM (DSIM), where interlayer distances are optimized, and stacked flexible intelligent metasurface (SFIM), where each metasurface layer is fully morphable. We jointly design the meta-atom positions and responses together with the transmit beamformer to maximize the system sum rate under per-user rate, quantization, morphing, and interlayer distance constraints. An alternating optimization framework combining gradient projection, penalty-based method, and successive convex approximation is developed to address the resulting non-convex problems. Perturbation analysis reveals that the flexibility gains of both DSIM and SFIM scale approximately linearly with the morphing range, with SFIM exhibiting a faster growth rate. Simulation results demonstrate that flexible SIM designs mitigate performance saturation with increasing layers and achieve significant transmit power savings compared to rigid SIMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

By decomposing the free energy of mixing into enthalpic, configurational, and rotational entropic contributions, we show that although the enthalpy of mixing is generally positive, the solid solutions are thermodynamically stable against phase separation due to the large configurational entropy associated with random substitution on cation and halide sublattices. Mixing reduces the rotational entropy of the organic cations, partially offsetting the configurational stabilization. However, within our model, this rotational penalty is not sufficient to overcome the configurational driving force, and a curvature analysis within a regular-solution model does not predict a miscibility gap for any of the mixing channels considered. Analysis of hydrogen-bond dynamics shows that MA--Y (Y = I, Br) interactions are more persistent than FA--Y interactions, while the dominant FA-donated N$-$H$\\cdots$I hydrogen bonds remain nearly composition-invariant. Cs-containing mixtures, in which Cs$^{+}$ forms no hydrogen bonds, can nevertheless be thermodynamically stable.

To meet practical error-rate targets, existing linear methods require an excessively high number of access point antennas relative to the number of supported users, leading to disproportionate increases in power consumption.Efficient non-linear processing frameworks for uplink MIMO transmissions, such as NL-COMM, have been proposed. However, downlink non-linear precoding methods, such as Vector Perturbation (VP), remain impractical for real-world deployment due to their exponentially increasing computational complexity with the number of supported streams. This work presents ViPer NL-COMM, the first practical algorithmic and implementation framework for VP-based precoding. ViPer NL-COMM extends the core principles of NL-COMM to the precoding problem, enabling scalable parallelization and real-time computational performance while maintaining the substantial spectral-efficiency benefits of VP precoding. ViPer NL-COMM consists of a novel mathematical framework and an FPGA prototype capable of supporting large MIMO configurations (up to 16x16), high-order modulation (256-QAM), and wide bandwidths (100 MHz) within practical power and resource budgets. System-level evaluations demonstrate that ViPer NL-COMM achieves target error rates using only half the number of transmit antennas required by linear precoding, yielding net power savings on the order of hundreds of Watts at the RF front end.

However, existing methods that explicitly store language vectors in grid or node-based maps struggle to scale to large environments due to excessive memory requirements and limited resolution for fine-grained planning. We introduce LAMP (Language Map), a novel neural language field-based navigation framework that learns a continuous, language-driven map and directly leverages it for fine-grained path generation. Unlike prior approaches, our method encodes language features as an implicit neural field rather than storing them explicitly at every location. By combining this implicit representation with a sparse graph, LAMP supports efficient coarse path planning and then performs gradient-based optimization in the learned field to refine poses near the goal. This coarse-to-fine pipeline, language-driven, gradient-guided optimization is the first application of an implicit language map for precise path generation. This refinement is particularly effective at selecting goal regions not directly observed by leveraging semantic similarities in the learned feature space. To further enhance robustness, we adopt a Bayesian framework that models embedding uncertainty via the von Mises-Fisher distribution, thereby improving generalization to unobserved regions. To scale to large environments, LAMP employs a graph sampling strategy that prioritizes spatial coverage and embedding confidence, retaining only the most informative nodes and substantially reducing computational overhead. Our experimental results, both in NVIDIA Isaac Sim and on a real multi-floor building, demonstrate that LAMP outperforms existing explicit methods in both memory efficiency and fine-grained goal-reaching accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Analyzing few-shot effects reveals how much contextual supervision is sufficient to balance data efficiency and predictive accuracy, particularly in low-data environments. Results show that large language models exhibit strong inherent temporal understanding of human behavior: even in zero-shot settings, they produce coherent daily activity predictions, while adding one or two demonstrations further refines duration calibration and categorical accuracy. Beyond a few examples, performance saturates, indicating diminishing returns. Sequence-level evaluation confirms consistent temporal alignment across few-shot conditions.

To address this limitation, we propose a novel and flexible Arbitrary Ratio Feature Compression (ARFC) framework, which supports any compression ratio with a single model, eliminating the need for multiple specialized models. At its core, the Arbitrary Ratio Compressor (ARC) is an auto-regressive model that performs compression via next-token prediction. This allows the compression ratio to be controlled at inference simply by adjusting the number of generated tokens. To enhance the quality of the compressed features, two key modules are introduced. The Mixture of Solutions (MoS) module refines the compressed tokens by utilizing multiple compression results (solutions), reducing uncertainty and improving robustness. The Entity Relation Graph Constraint (ERGC) is integrated into the training process to preserve semantic and structural relationships during compression. Extensive experiments on cross-modal retrieval, image classification, and image retrieval tasks across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches at various compression ratios.

Its collaboration with vision is highly expected to enhance performances of the manipulation policy in complex tasks. However, recent studies have reported inconsistent observations on the generalization of vision-proprioception policies. In this work, we investigate this by conducting temporally controlled experiments. We found that during task sub-phases that robot's motion transitions, which require target localization, the vision modality of the vision-proprioception policy plays a limited role. Further analysis reveals that the policy naturally gravitates toward concise proprioceptive signals that offer faster loss reduction when training, thereby dominating the optimization and suppressing the learning of the visual modality during motion-transition phases. To alleviate this, we propose the Gradient Adjustment with Phase-guidance (GAP) algorithm that adaptively modulates the optimization of proprioception, enabling dynamic collaboration within the vision-proprioception policy. Specifically, we leverage proprioception to capture robotic states and estimate the probability of each timestep in the trajectory belonging to motion-transition phases. During policy learning, we apply fine-grained adjustment that reduces the magnitude of proprioception's gradient based on estimated probabilities, leading to robust and generalizable vision-proprioception policies. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate GAP is applicable in both simulated and real-world environments, across one-arm and dual-arm setups, and compatible with both conventional and Vision-Language-Action models.

Text-based metadata and image-based vision data are then processed and integrated into a unified format, where well-trained Deep Convolutional Neural Networks extract key attributes, including damage state, material type, and damage level. Finally, all data are fed into an LLM with carefully designed prompts, enabling the LLM-DRS to generate summary reports for individual structures or affected regions based on aggregated attributes and metadata.

Unfortunately, existing world models lack the physical fidelity necessary for policy improvement: they are predominantly trained on demonstration datasets that lack coverage of many different physical interactions (particularly failure cases) and struggle to accurately model small yet critical physical details in contact-rich object manipulation. We propose a simple iterative improvement algorithm that uses real-world roll-out data to improve the fidelity of the world model, which can then, in turn, be used to generate supplemental synthetic data for improving the VLA model.

This is achieved by using a contact-based multi-object trajectory optimizer within a model predictive controller, integrated with a physics-aware perception system that estimates object poses even during inevitable occlusions, and a method that suggests physically-feasible locations to place the object inside the container.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Prior studies suggest that replacing critical tokens can refine reasoning trajectories. Nonetheless, reliably identifying and exploiting critical tokens remains challenging. To address this, we propose the Paraphrastic Probing and Consistency Verification~(PPCV) framework. PPCV operates in two stages. In the first stage, we roll out an initial reasoning path from the original question and then concatenate paraphrased versions of the question with this reasoning path. And we identify critical tokens based on mismatches between the predicted top-1 token and the expected token in the reasoning path. A criterion is employed to confirm the final critical token. In the second stage, we substitute critical tokens with candidate alternatives and roll out new reasoning paths for both the original and paraphrased questions. The final answer is determined by checking the consistency of outputs across these parallel reasoning processes. We evaluate PPCV on mainstream LLMs across multiple benchmarks.

Our findings show that model scaling and adaptation strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, fine-tuning) yield consistent improvements, outperforming encoder-only baselines like XLM-R and ModernBERT. We argue that improving critical error detection in MT contributes to safer, more trustworthy, and socially accountable information systems by reducing the risk of disinformation, miscommunication, and linguistic harm, especially in high-stakes or underrepresented contexts.

This paper investigates the use of LLMs to generate agricultural synthetic simulation environments from natural language prompts, specifically to address the limitations of lacking domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. A modular multi-LLM pipeline was developed, integrating 3D asset retrieval, domain knowledge injection, and code generation for the Unreal rendering engine using its API. This results in a 3D environment with realistic planting layouts and environmental context, all based on the input prompt and the domain knowledge. To enhance accuracy and scalability, the system employs a hybrid strategy combining LLM optimization techniques such as few-shot prompting, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), finetuning, and validation. Unlike monolithic models, the modular architecture enables structured data handling, intermediate verification, and flexible expansion. The system was evaluated using structured prompts and semantic accuracy metrics.

This paper argues that these limitations are closely tied to an overlooked component, pretrained visual representation, which offers insufficient knowledge on both aspects of environment understanding and policy prior. Through an in-depth analysis, we find that commonly used visual representations in VLAs, whether pretrained via language-image contrastive learning or image-based self-supervised learning, remain inadequate at capturing crucial, task-relevant environment information and at inducing effective policy priors, i.e., anticipatory knowledge of how the environment evolves under successful task execution. In contrast, we discover that predictive embeddings pretrained on videos, in particular V-JEPA 2, are adept at flexibly discarding unpredictable environment factors and encoding task-relevant temporal dynamics, thereby effectively compensating for key shortcomings of existing visual representations in VLAs. Building on these observations, we introduce JEPA-VLA, a simple yet effective approach that adaptively integrates predictive embeddings into existing VLAs.

To address this issue, we notably find and demonstrate that Tsallis Entropy (TE), a generalized form of SE, is naturally suited for characterizing biased distributions by introducing a non-extensive parameter q, with the performance of SE serving as a lower bound for TE. Building upon this, we generalize TE into Adaptive Debiasing Tsallis Entropy (ADTE) for TTA, customizing a class-specific parameter q^l derived by normalizing the estimated label bias from continuously incoming test instances, for each category. This adaptive approach allows ADTE to accurately select high-confidence views and seamlessly integrate with a label adjustment strategy to enhance adaptation, without introducing distribution-specific hyperparameter tuning.

In this work, we present DMAP, a mathematically grounded method that maps a text, via a language model, to a set of samples in the unit interval that jointly encode rank and probability information. This representation enables efficient, model-agnostic analysis and supports a range of applications. We illustrate its utility through three case studies: (i) validation of generation parameters to ensure data integrity, (ii) examining the role of probability curvature in machine-generated text detection, and (iii) a forensic analysis revealing statistical fingerprints left in downstream models that have been subject to post-training on synthetic data.

To address this, we propose Region-to-Image Distillation, which transforms zooming from an inference-time tool into a training-time primitive, thereby internalizing the benefits of agentic zooming into a single forward pass of an MLLM. In particular, we first zoom in to micro-cropped regions to let strong teacher models generate high-quality VQA data, and then distill this region-grounded supervision back to the full image. After training on such data, the smaller student model improves \"single-glance\" fine-grained perception without tool use.

Although deep learning models have demonstrated significant accuracy, they frequently suffer from miscalibration, manifested as overconfidence in erroneous predictions.

In order to address this necessity, the present paper proposes a generalizable probabilistic optimization framework grounded in Bayesian deep learning. Specifically, a novel Confidence-Uncertainty Boundary Loss (CUB-Loss) is introduced that imposes penalties on high-certainty errors and low-certainty correct predictions, explicitly enforcing alignment between prediction correctness and uncertainty estimates. Complementing this training-time optimization, a Dual Temperature Scaling (DTS) strategy is devised for post-hoc calibration, further refining the posterior distribution to improve intuitive explainability. The proposed framework is validated on three distinct medical imaging tasks: automatic screening of pneumonia, diabetic retinopathy detection, and identification of skin lesions.

Methods This paper presents an HDR imaging system that leverages the spatial modulation capability of a digital micromirror device (DMD). The system architecture enables autonomous regional segmentation and adaptive exposure control for high-dynamic-range scenes through an integrated framework comprising two synergistic subsystems: a DMD-based optical modulation unit and an adaptive computational imaging pipeline. Results The system achieves a measurable dynamic range of 127 dB, effectively eliminating satu ration artifacts under high glare. Experimental results demonstrate a 78% reduction in strain error and improved DIC positioning accuracy, confirming reliable performance across extreme intensity variations. Conclusion The DMD-based system provides high fidelity adaptive HDR imaging, overcoming key limitations of conventional sensors. It exhibits strong potential for optical metrology and stress analysis in high-glare environments where traditional methods are inadequate.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Especially the capacity of Small Language Models (SLMs) is limited, leading to factually incorrect generations. This problem is often mitigated by giving the SLM access to an outside source: the ability to query a larger model, documents, or a database. Under this setting, we study the fundamental question of \\emph{which tokens an SLM can and should learn} during pretraining, versus \\emph{which ones it should delegate} via a \\texttt{<CALL>} token. We find that this is not simply a question of loss: although the loss is predictive of whether a predicted token mismatches the ground-truth, some tokens are \\emph{acceptable} in that they are truthful alternative continuations of a pretraining document, and should not trigger a \\texttt{<CALL>} even if their loss is high. We find that a spaCy grammar parser can help augment the loss signal to decide which tokens the SLM should learn to delegate to prevent factual errors and which are safe to learn and predict even under high losses. We propose LaCy, a novel pretraining method based on this token selection philosophy. Our experiments demonstrate that LaCy models successfully learn which tokens to predict and where to delegate for help. This results in higher FactScores when generating in a cascade with a bigger model and outperforms Rho or LLM-judge trained SLMs, while being simpler and cheaper.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Specifically, we observe that video attention is not reliably sparse, but instead combines pronounced periodic structure driven by spatiotemporal position with dynamic, sparse semantic correspondences and dense mixing, exceeding the representational capacity of even oracle top-k attention.

However, this global dependency incurs quadratic complexity in sequence length, inducing an inherent \"encode-the-whole-utterance\" latency profile. For streaming use cases, this causes TTFT to grow linearly with utterance length as the encoder must process the entire prefix before any decoder token can be emitted.

When downstream data exhibit a substantial distribution shift from the model's prior training distribution, SFT can induce catastrophic forgetting. To narrow this gap, data rewriting has been proposed as a data-centric approach that rewrites downstream training data prior to SFT. However, existing methods typically sample rewrites from a prompt-induced conditional distribution, so the resulting targets are not necessarily aligned with the model's natural QA-style generation distribution. Moreover, reliance on fixed templates can lead to diversity collapse. To address these issues, we cast data rewriting as a policy learning problem and learn a rewriting policy that better matches the backbone's QA-style generation distribution while preserving diversity. Since distributional alignment, diversity and task consistency are automatically evaluable but difficult to optimize end-to-end with differentiable objectives, we leverage reinforcement learning to optimize the rewrite distribution under reward feedback and propose an RL-based data-rewriting agent. The agent jointly optimizes QA-style distributional alignment and diversity under a hard task-consistency gate, thereby constructing a higher-quality rewritten dataset for downstream SFT.

Classical results in compressed sensing imply that for $k$-sparse inputs, $d = O(k\\log (m/k))$ suffices if we allow non-linear decoding algorithms (Candes and Tao, 2006; Candes et al., 2006; Donoho, 2006). However, the additional requirement of linear decoding takes the problem out of the classical compressed sensing, into linear compressed sensing.\n  Our main theoretical result establishes nearly-matching upper and lower bounds for linear compressed sensing. We prove that $d = \u03a9_\u03b5(\\frac{k^2}{\\log k}\\log (m/k))$ is required while $d = O_\u03b5(k^2\\log m)$ suffices. The lower bound establishes a quantitative gap between classical and linear compressed setting, illustrating how linear accessibility is a meaningfully stronger hypothesis than linear representation alone. The upper bound confirms that neurons can store an exponential number of features under the LRH, giving theoretical evidence for the \"superposition hypothesis\" (Elhage et al., 2022).\n  The upper bound proof uses standard random constructions of matrices with approximately orthogonal columns. The lower bound proof uses rank bounds for near-identity matrices (Alon, 2003) together with Tur\u00e1n's theorem (bounding the number of edges in clique-free graphs). We also show how our results do and do not constrain the geometry of feature representations and extend our results to allow decoders with an activation function and bias.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this work, we introduce the Prototype Transformer (ProtoT) -- an autoregressive LM architecture based on prototypes (parameter vectors), posed as an alternative to the standard self-attention-based transformers. ProtoT works by means of two-way communication between the input sequence and the prototypes, and we show that this leads to the prototypes automatically capturing nameable concepts (e.g. \"woman\") during training.

However, they often generate over-long chains-of-thought that, driven by substantial reflections such as repetitive self-questioning and circular reasoning, lead to high token consumption, substantial computational overhead, and increased latency without improving accuracy, particularly in smaller models. Our observation reveals that increasing problem complexity induces more excessive and unnecessary reflection, which in turn reduces accuracy and increases token overhead. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Reflection and Length Coordinated Penalty (ARLCP), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to dynamically balance reasoning efficiency and solution accuracy. ARLCP introduces two key innovations: (1) a reflection penalty that adaptively curtails unnecessary reflective steps while preserving essential reasoning, and (2) a length penalty calibrated to the estimated complexity of the problem. By coordinating these penalties, ARLCP encourages the model to generate more concise and effective reasoning paths. We evaluate our method on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B models. Experimental results show that ARLCP achieves a superior efficiency-accuracy trade-off compared to existing approaches. For the 1.5B model, it reduces the average response length by 53.1% while simultaneously improving accuracy by 5.8%. For the 7B model, it achieves a 35.0% reduction in length with a 2.7% accuracy gain.

At inference time, the selector performs a single vectorized scoring pass over the full candidate pool and returns the top-k demonstrations, requiring no model fine-tuning, no online exploration, and no additional LLM calls. This yields deterministic rankings and makes the selection mechanism straightforward to audit via interpretable feature weights.\n  Beyond proposing Meta-Sel, we provide a broad empirical study of demonstration selection, benchmarking 12 methods -- spanning prompt engineering baselines, heuristic selection, reinforcement learning, and influence-based approaches -- across four intent datasets and five open-source LLMs. Across this benchmark, Meta-Sel consistently ranks among the top-performing methods, is particularly effective for smaller models where selection quality can partially compensate for limited model capacity, and maintains competitive selection-time overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

To test this, we design a suite of four diverse \"vulnerability games\", each presenting a unique, exploitable flaw related to context-conditional compliance, proxy metrics, reward tampering, and self-evaluation. Our experiments show that models consistently learn to exploit these vulnerabilities, discovering opportunistic strategies that significantly increase their reward at the expense of task correctness or safety. More critically, we find that these exploitative strategies are not narrow \"tricks\" but generalizable skills; they can be transferred to new tasks and even \"distilled\" from a capable teacher model to other student models through data alone. Our findings reveal that capability-oriented training induced risks pose a fundamental challenge to current alignment approaches, suggesting that future AI safety work must extend beyond content moderation to rigorously auditing and securing the training environments and reward mechanisms themselves.

In this work, we first theoretically show that OPD is a special case of dense KL-constrained RL where the reward function and the KL regularization are always weighted equally and the reference model can by any model. Then, we propose the Generalized On-Policy Distillation (G-OPD) framework, which extends the standard OPD objective by introducing a flexible reference model and a reward scaling factor that controls the relative weight of the reward term against the KL regularization. Through comprehensive experiments on math reasoning and code generation tasks, we derive two novel insights: (1) Setting the reward scaling factor to be greater than 1 (i.e., reward extrapolation), which we term ExOPD, consistently improves over standard OPD across a range of teacher-student size pairings. In particular, in the setting where we merge the knowledge from different domain experts, obtained by applying domain-specific RL to the same student model, back into the original student, ExOPD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's performance boundary and outperform the domain teachers. (2) Building on ExOPD, we further find that in the strong-to-weak distillation setting (i.e., distilling a smaller student from a larger teacher), performing reward correction by choosing the reference model as the teacher's base model before RL yields a more accurate reward signal and further improves distillation performance. However, this choice assumes access to the teacher's pre-RL variant and incurs more computational overhead. We hope our work offers new insights for future research on OPD.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Traditional compression techniques, such as dictionary-based and statistical methods, often struggle to optimally exploit the structure and redundancy in complex data formats. Recent advancements in deep learning have opened new avenues for compression; however, many existing approaches depend on dense vector representations that obscure the underlying token structure. To address these limitations, we propose a novel lossless compression method that leverages Reinforcement Learning applied to a T5 language model architecture. This approach enables the compression of data into sequences of tokens rather than traditional vector representations. Unlike auto-encoders, which typically encode information into continuous latent spaces, our method preserves the token-based structure, aligning more closely with the original data format. This preservation allows for higher compression ratios while maintaining semantic integrity. By training the model using an off-policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm, we optimize sequence length to minimize redundancy and enhance compression efficiency. Our method introduces an efficient and adaptive data compression system built upon advanced Reinforcement Learning techniques, functioning independently of external grammatical or world knowledge. This approach shows significant improvements in compression ratios compared to conventional methods. By leveraging the latent information within language models, our system effectively compresses data without requiring explicit content understanding, paving the way for more robust and practical compression solutions across various applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Here, we use a cognitively-grounded definition of ToM to develop and test a new evaluation framework. Specifically, our approach probes whether LLMs have a coherent, domain-general, and consistent model of how mental states cause behavior -- regardless of whether that model matches a human-like ToM. We find that even though LLMs succeed in approximating human judgments in a simple ToM paradigm, they fail at a logically equivalent task and exhibit low consistency between their action predictions and corresponding mental state inferences.

However, current methods for distillation via synthetic data lack pedagogical awareness, treating knowledge transfer as a one-off data synthesis and training task rather than a systematic learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel pedagogically-inspired framework for LLM knowledge distillation that draws from fundamental educational principles. Our approach introduces a three-stage pipeline -- Knowledge Identifier, Organizer, and Adapter (IOA) -- that systematically identifies knowledge deficiencies in student models, organizes knowledge delivery through progressive curricula, and adapts representations to match the cognitive capacity of student models. We integrate Bloom's Mastery Learning Principles and Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development to create a dynamic distillation process where student models approach teacher model's performance on prerequisite knowledge before advancing, and new knowledge is introduced with controlled, gradual difficulty increments. Extensive experiments using LLaMA-3.1/3.2 and Qwen2.5 as student models demonstrate that IOA achieves significant improvements over baseline distillation methods, with student models retaining 94.7% of teacher performance on DollyEval while using less than 1/10th of the parameters.

First, the configuration space for developing a mixing method is not well understood -- design choices across existing methods lack justification or consensus and overlook practical issues like data constraints. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study of this space, identifying which design choices lead to a strong mixing method. Second, in practice, the domain set evolves throughout LM development as datasets are added, removed, partitioned, and revised -- a problem setting largely unaddressed by existing works, which assume fixed domains. We study how to efficiently recompute the mixture after the domain set is updated, leveraging information from past mixtures. We introduce mixture reuse, a mechanism that reuses existing ratios and recomputes ratios only for domains affected by the update.

In this work, we present CATTS, a simple technique for dynamically allocating compute for multi-step agents. We first conduct an empirical study of inference-time scaling for web agents. We find that uniformly increasing per-step compute quickly saturates in long-horizon environments. We then investigate stronger aggregation strategies, including an LLM-based Arbiter that can outperform naive voting, but that can overrule high-consensus decisions. We show that uncertainty statistics derived from the agent's own vote distribution (entropy and top-1/top-2 margin) correlate with downstream success and provide a practical signal for dynamic compute allocation.
