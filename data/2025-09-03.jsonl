We identify the dominant limiting mechanism to be\nthe long-range longitudinal optical phonon scattering, which is significantly\nsuppressed at high doping due to free-carrier screening, leading to enhanced\nphonon-limited mobility. While ionized impurity scattering emerges as a\ncompeting mechanism at carrier concentrations up to ~10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$, the\nphonon scattering reduction dominates, yielding a net mobility increase with\npredicted room-temperature values reaching about twice the highest experimental\nreport.

The spectroscopic signature of such interaction\nis often subtle and requires special probes to observe. To this end,\ninter-layer excitons trapped in the periodic potential wells of a moir\\'e\nsuperlattice offer rich interaction physics, specifically due to the presence\nof both attractive and repulsive components in the interaction. Here we show\nthat the Coulomb force between two inter-layer excitons switches from repulsive\nto attractive when the length scale reduces from inter-moir\\'e-pocket to\nintra-moir\\'e-pocket in a WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ hetero-bilayer - thanks to the complex\ncompetition between direct and exchange interaction. The finding is a departure\nfrom the usual notion of repelling inter-layer excitons due to layer\npolarization. This manifests as the simultaneous observation of an anomalous\nsuperlinear power-law of moir\\'e exciton and a stabilization of moir\\'e trapped\nbiexciton. The experimental observation is facilitated by placing the\nhetero-bilayer on a polymer-nanopillar/gold-film stack which significantly\nreduces the inhomogeneous spectral broadening by selectively probing a smaller\nensemble of moir\\'e pockets compared with a flat sample.

We examine the interplay of four\ncritical factors -- velocity, position, smoothing, and data density -- on\nreconstruction performance. A key contribution of this study is evaluation of\nthese methods across sparse and dense datasets, providing insights into the\ntrade-off between accuracy and resource allocation. Our evaluation framework\ncombines traditional mathematical error metrics for positional and velocity\nwith practical considerations, such as physical realism (e.g., aligning\nvelocity and acceleration with stopped states, deceleration rates, and speed\nvariability).

Therefore, while recent methods (e.g., IntrinsicAnything)\nhave achieved breakthroughs by harnessing powerful diffusion priors, they\nremain predominantly trained on large-scale synthetic datasets (e.g.,\nObjaverse) and applied directly to real-world RGB images, which ignores the\nlarge domain gap between synthetic and real-world data and leads to suboptimal\ngeneralization performance. In this work, we address this gap by proposing\nIntrinsicReal, a novel domain adaptation framework that bridges the\nabove-mentioned domain gap for real-world intrinsic image decomposition.\nSpecifically, our IntrinsicReal adapts IntrinsicAnything to the real domain by\nfine-tuning it using its high-quality output albedos selected by a novel dual\npseudo-labeling strategy: i) pseudo-labeling with an absolute confidence\nthreshold on classifier predictions, and ii) pseudo-labeling using the relative\npreference ranking of classifier predictions for individual input objects. This\nstrategy is inspired by human evaluation, where identifying the highest-quality\noutputs is straightforward, but absolute scores become less reliable for\nsub-optimal cases. In these situations, relative comparisons of outputs become\nmore accurate. To implement this, we propose a novel two-phase pipeline that\nsequentially applies these pseudo-labeling techniques to effectively adapt\nIntrinsicAnything to the real domain.

Although contemporary dehazing models have\ndemonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated\nhigh-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to\ndownsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads\nto a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the\ndifficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with\nlocalized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this\nchapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local\nFeatures Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for\nhigh-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:\nthe Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The\nGFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual\nunderstanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary\noutput by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby\ncapturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To\nevaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer\narchitecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on\nhigh-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak\nsignal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in\naddressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is\nmodel-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed\nglobal-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners\ncan harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving\nvisual fidelity in high-resolution environments."}

Despite these advancements, 3D-GS still\nstruggles to meet the frames per second (FPS) demands of real-time\napplications. In this paper, we introduce GS-TG, a tile-grouping-based\naccelerator that enhances 3D-GS rendering speed by reducing redundant sorting\noperations and preserving rasterization efficiency. GS-TG addresses a critical\ntrade-off issue in 3D-GS rendering: increasing the tile size effectively\nreduces redundant sorting operations, but it concurrently increases unnecessary\nrasterization computations. So, during sorting of the proposed approach, GS-TG\ngroups small tiles (for making large tiles) to share sorting operations across\ntiles within each group, significantly reducing redundant computations. During\nrasterization, a bitmask assigned to each Gaussian identifies relevant small\ntiles, to enable efficient sharing of sorting results. Consequently, GS-TG\nenables sorting to be performed as if a large tile size is used by grouping\ntiles during the sorting stage, while allowing rasterization to proceed with\nthe original small tiles by using bitmasks in the rasterization stage. GS-TG is\na lossless method requiring no retraining or fine-tuning and it can be\nseamlessly integrated with previous 3D-GS optimization techniques. Experimental\nresults show that GS-TG achieves an average speed-up of 1.54 times over\nstate-of-the-art 3D-GS accelerators."}

This paper presents LinkBo, an innovative single-wire\nprotocol that offers reduced latency, enhanced throughput, and greater\nrobustness with hardware-interrupt for variable-distance inter-chip\ncommunication. The LinkBo protocol-level guarantees that high-priority messages\nare delivered with an error detection feature in just 50.4 $\\mu$s, surpassing\ncurrent commercial options, 1-wire and UNI/O by at least 20X and 6.3X,\nrespectively.

However, the general case with arbitrary\nconcave speedup functions -- which more accurately capture real-world workloads\n-- has remained open.\n  In this paper, we solve this open problem by developing optimal scheduling\nalgorithms for parallel jobs under general concave speedup functions. We first\ndiscover a fundamental and broadly-applicable rule for optimal parallel\nscheduling, namely the Consistent Derivative Ratio (CDR) Rule, which states\nthat the ratio of the derivatives of the speedup functions across active jobs\nremains constant over time. To efficiently compute the optimal allocations that\nsatisfy the CDR Rule, we propose the General Water-Filling (GWF) method, a more\ngeneral version of classical water-filling in wireless communications.\nCombining these insights, we design the SmartFill Algorithm to solve the\ngeneral scheduling problem.

To\naddress this, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates\nbreast ultrasound (BUS) images with structured clinical data to improve\ndiagnostic accuracy. We developed a dual-branch neural network that extracts\nand fuses features from ultrasound images and patient metadata from 81 subjects\nwith confirmed PTs. Class-aware sampling and subject-stratified 5-fold\ncross-validation were applied to prevent class imbalance and data leakage. The\nresults show that our proposed multimodal method outperforms unimodal baselines\nin classifying benign versus borderline/malignant PTs. Among six image\nencoders, ConvNeXt and ResNet18 achieved the best performance in the multimodal\nsetting, with AUC-ROC scores of 0.9427 and 0.9349, and F1-scores of 0.6720 and\n0.7294, respectively.

This lack of mechanistic insight is a\ncentral challenge for deploying learned policies in real-world robotics, where\nrobustness and explainability are critical. Motivated by advances in\nmechanistic interpretability for large language models, we introduce the first\nframework for interpreting and steering VLAs via their internal\nrepresentations, enabling direct intervention in model behavior at inference\ntime. We project feedforward activations within transformer layers onto the\ntoken embedding basis, identifying sparse semantic directions - such as speed\nand direction - that are causally linked to action selection. Leveraging these\nfindings, we introduce a general-purpose activation steering method that\nmodulates behavior in real time, without fine-tuning, reward signals, or\nenvironment interaction. We evaluate this method on two recent open-source\nVLAs, Pi0 and OpenVLA, and demonstrate zero-shot behavioral control in\nsimulation (LIBERO) and on a physical robot (UR5). This work demonstrates that\ninterpretable components of embodied VLAs can be systematically harnessed for\ncontrol - establishing a new paradigm for transparent and steerable foundation\nmodels in robotics."}

One of the main challenges towards the successful\ndeployment of LLMs is memory management, since they typically involve billions\nof parameters. To this end, architectures based on Mixture-of-Experts have been\nproposed, which aim to reduce the size of the parameters that are activated\nwhen producing a token. This raises the equally critical issue of efficiently\nmanaging the limited cache of the system, in that frequently used experts\nshould be stored in the fast cache rather than in the slower secondary memory.\n  In this work, we introduce and study a new paging problem that models expert\nmanagement optimization. Our formulation captures both the layered architecture\nof LLMs and the requirement that experts are cached efficiently. We first\npresent lower bounds on the competitive ratio of both deterministic and\nrandomized algorithms, which show that under mild assumptions, LRU-like\npolicies have good theoretical competitive performance. We then propose a\nlayer-based extension of LRU that is tailored to the problem at hand.\n  Extensive simulations on both synthetic datasets and actual traces of MoE\nusage show that our algorithm outperforms policies for the classic paging\nproblem, such as the standard LRU."}

Asynchronous FL addresses this by allowing clients\nto update independently, offering better scalability and responsiveness in\nheterogeneous environments.\n  Our research develops an asynchronous decentralized FL approach in two\nprogressive phases.

The system autonomously\nsamples, processes and identifies signals from a casing collar locator (CCL) in\nsitu within oil and gas wells. Casing collar identification is achieved using a\nlightweight dynamic threshold and physical plausibility algorithm deployed on\nan embedded platform, which serves as the system's processor. Field tests\nconducted in an actual oil well in Sichuan, China, demonstrated the DTPPMP's\nability to accurately identify casing collar signals, measure depths, and\neffectively perforate at designated perforating intervals in real-time. The\nsystem achieved a perforation variation of less than the length of a single\nperforating interval and a F1 score of 98.6% for casing collar identification.\nThese results provide valuable recommendations for advancing automation and\nintelligence in future perforation operations."}

Surprisingly,\nwe observe substantial boosts in performances, which points to the potential of\nadapting a subset of the model's parameters in the transductive few-shot\nsetting. We report comprehensive evaluations, which show that LIMO outperforms\nthe very recent transductive few-shot CLIP methods by a large margin and yields\nsignificant gains over the best-performing inductive methods.

The results show that human dialogues are significantly superior to\ntheir AI counterparts in utterance length, as well as in questioning (I-Q) and\ngeneral feedback (F-F) behaviors. More importantly, ENA results reveal a\nfundamental divergence in interactional patterns: human dialogues are more\ncognitively guided and diverse, centered around a \"question-factual\nresponse-feedback\" teaching loop that clearly reflects pedagogical guidance and\nstudent-driven thinking; in contrast, simulated dialogues exhibit a pattern of\nstructural simplification and behavioral convergence, revolving around an\n\"explanation-simplistic response\" loop that is essentially a simple information\ntransfer between the teacher and student.

To address\nthis modality imbalance, we introduce BALM-TSF (Balanced Multimodal Alignment\nfor LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting), a lightweight time series forecasting\nframework that maintains balance between the two modalities.

Evaluating a suite of\nstate-of-the-art models on these original and rewritten prompts, we find that\nrewritten \"deploy-like\" prompts induce a significant and consistent shift in\nbehavior. Across all models, we observed an average increase in honest\nresponses of 5.26% and a corresponding average decrease in deceptive responses\nof 12.40%. Furthermore, refusal rates increased by an average of 6.38%,\nindicating heightened safety compliance. Our findings demonstrate that\nevaluation awareness is a quantifiable and manipulable factor that directly\ninfluences LLM behavior, revealing that models are more prone to unsafe or\ndeceptive outputs in perceived test environments. This underscores the urgent\nneed for more realistic evaluation frameworks to accurately gauge true model\nalignment before deployment."}

However, hallucination\nissues still persist. Similar to the bimodal setting, the priors from the text\nmodality tend to dominate, leading OLLMs to rely more heavily on textual cues\nwhile neglecting visual and audio information. In addition, fully multimodal\nscenarios introduce new challenges. Most existing models align visual or\nauditory modalities with text independently during training, while ignoring the\nintrinsic correlations between video and its corresponding audio. This\noversight results in hallucinations when reasoning requires interpreting hidden\naudio cues embedded in video content. To address these challenges, we propose\nOmniDPO, a preference-alignment framework designed to mitigate hallucinations\nin OLLMs. Specifically, OmniDPO incorporates two strategies: (1) constructing\ntext-preference sample pairs to enhance the model's understanding of\naudio-video interactions; and (2) constructing multimodal-preference sample\npairs to strengthen the model's attention to visual and auditory information.\nBy tackling both challenges, OmniDPO effectively improves multimodal grounding\nand reduces hallucination. Experiments conducted on two OLLMs demonstrate that\nOmniDPO not only effectively mitigates multimodal hallucinations but also\nsignificantly enhances the models' reasoning capabilities across modalities.\nAll code and datasets will be released upon paper acceptance."}

We introduce a heterogenous basin graph where every\nland and river pixel is a node connected by physical hydrological flow\ndirections and inter-catchment relationships. We propose HydroGAT, a\nspatiotemporal network that adaptively learns local temporal importance and the\nmost influential upstream locations. Evaluated in two Midwestern US basins and\nacross five baseline architectures, our model achieves higher NSE (up to 0.97),\nimproved KGE (up to 0.96), and low bias (PBIAS within $\\pm$5%) in hourly\ndischarge prediction, while offering interpretable attention maps that reveal\nsparse, structured intercatchment influences. To support high-resolution\nbasin-scale training, we develop a distributed data-parallel pipeline that\nscales efficiently up to 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs on NERSC Perlmutter supercomputer,\ndemonstrating up to 15x speedup across machines.

While many efforts have been made to apply pre-trained visual\nmodels to 3D domains through \"high-to-low\" mapping, these approaches often lead\nto the loss of spatial geometries and lack a generalizable framework for\nadapting any modality to 3D. This paper, therefore, attempts to directly\nleverage point features to calibrate the heterogeneous foundation model of any\nmodality for 3D point cloud analysis. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive\nPoint-Prompt Tuning (APPT) method, which fine-tunes pre-trained models with a\nmodest number of parameters, enabling direct point cloud processing without\nheterogeneous mappings. We convert raw point clouds into point embeddings by\naggregating local geometry to capture spatial features followed by linear\nlayers to ensure seamless utilization of frozen pre-trained models. Given the\ninherent disorder of point clouds, in contrast to the structured nature of\nimages and language, we employ a permutation-invariant feature to capture the\nrelative positions of point embeddings, thereby obtaining point tokens enriched\nwith location information to optimize self-attention mechanisms. To calibrate\nself-attention across source domains of any modality to 3D and reduce\ncomputational overhead, we introduce a prompt generator that shares weights\nwith the point embedding module, dynamically producing point-prompts without\nadding additional parameters.

The spatial safe planning is guided by a\ndynamic hazard field (DHF) for risk assessment, while temporal safe planning is\nbased on a space-time graph. Besides, the quintic polynomial sampling and\nsub-reward of comforts are used to ensure comforts during lane-changing. The\nsub-reward of efficiency is used to maintain driving efficiency. Finally, the\nproposed DHF-enhanced objective function integrates multiple objectives,\nproviding a proper optimization tasks for QP-MPC. Extensive simulations\ndemonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms benchmark optimization\nmethods in terms of efficiency, stability, and comfort across a variety of\nscenarios likes lane-changing, overtaking, and crossing intersections."}

Classical optimization-based methods typically rely on the gradients\nof signed distance fields (SDFs) to impose collision-avoidance constraints.\nHowever, these methods are susceptible to local minima and may fail when the\nSDF gradients vanish. Recently, Configuration Space Distance Fields (CDFs) have\nbeen introduced, which directly model distances in the robot's configuration\nspace.

On the other hand, gradient-free\napproaches such as Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control leverage\nlong-horizon rollouts to achieve collision avoidance.

The growth of lithium\ndendrites in the electrolyte not only reduces the Coulombic efficiency of the\nbattery but also poses a risk of puncturing the electrolyte, leading to\ninternal short circuits between the anode and cathode. This study is to solve\nthe problem of lithium dendrite growth in solid-state lithium batteries by\nemploying phase-field theory for numerical simulations. A phase-field model is\ndeveloped by coupling the mechanical stress field, thermal field, and\nelectrochemical field, to investigate the morphology and evolution of lithium\ndendrites under the condition of different ambient temperatures, external\npressures, and their combined effects. The results indicate that higher\ntemperature and greater external pressure significantly suppress lithium\ndendrite growth, leading to fewer side branches, smoother surfaces, and more\nuniform electrochemical deposition. Increased external pressure inhibits\nlongitudinal dendrite growth, resulting in a compressed morphology with higher\ncompactness, but at the cost of increased mechanical instability. The combined\neffect of temperature and pressure exhibits a pronounced inhibitory influence\non dendrite growth, with stress concentrating at the dendrite roots.

Here we show that, when suitably engineered, environmental noise can\ninduce a \"Zeno-like\" stabilization of the charging process in a spin-chain\nquantum battery. To explore this interplay, we study a system size N=6, which\nprovides large storage capacity with moderate computational cost, and more\nimportantly, allows the stored energy to become almost fully extractable since\nthe ergotropy nearly coincides with the total capacity. We analyze three local\nnoise channels: bit flip, phase flip, and bit phase flip. We vary the strength\nof each channel to emulate frequent environmental monitoring, reminiscent of\nthe quantum Zeno effect, and track its influence on the charging dynamics and\nstored energy. The phase-flip channel slows charging under strong noise but\nstabilizes stored energy and ergotropy. The bit-flip channel enables faster\ncharging but saturates at low capacities, while the bit phase flip channel\ncombines both features. In the discharging stage, different noise channels lead\nto distinct release dynamics, showing that noise can paradoxically enhance and\nstabilize quantum battery operation."}

Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot\nsystem, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level\ncontroller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to\nfollow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally\nwith human within an end-to-end framework. Robix further introduces novel\ncapabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and\ncontext-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix\nleverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training\nstrategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning\nabilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and\ntask-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot\ninteraction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3)\nreinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon\ntask coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both\nopen-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in\ninteractive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse\ninstruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and\ninterrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery\nshopping, and dietary filtering."}

This problem suggests that general relativity and possibly also\nquantum mechanics need fundamental corrections. Most physicists expect that\ngravity should be quantum in character, but gravity is fundamentally different\nto the other forces because it alone is described by spacetime geometry.\nExperiments are needed to test whether gravity, and hence space-time, is\nquantum or classical. We propose an experiment to test the quantum nature of\ngravity by checking whether gravity can entangle two micron-sized crystals. A\npathway to this is to create macroscopic quantum superpositions of each crystal\nfirst using embedded spins and Stern-Gerlach forces. These crystals could be\nnanodiamonds containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres. The spins can\nsubsequently be measured to witness the gravitationally generated entanglement.\nThis is based on extensive theoretical feasibility studies and experimental\nprogress in quantum technology. The eventual experiment will require a\nmedium-sized consortium with excellent suppression of decoherence including\nvibrations and gravitational noise. In this white paper, we review the progress\nand plans towards realizing this. While implementing these plans, we will\nfurther explore the most macroscopic superpositions that are possible, which\nwill test theories that predict a limit to this."}

However, transferring VLMs from the natural\nimage domain to remote sensing (RS) segmentation remains challenging due to the\nlimited category diversity in RS datasets and the domain gap between natural\nand RS imagery. Here, we propose a training-free framework, DGL-RSIS, that\ndecouples visual and textual inputs, performing visual-language alignment at\nboth the local semantic and global contextual levels through tailored\nstrategies. Specifically, we first introduce a global-local decoupling (GLD)\nmodule, where text inputs are divided into local class nouns and global\nmodifiers using natural language processing (NLP) techniques; image inputs are\npartitioned into a set of class-agnostic mask proposals via unsupervised mask\nproposal networks. Second, visual and textual features are aligned at local\nscale, through a novel context-aware cropping strategy for extracting image\npatches with proper boundaries and introducing RS-specific knowledge to enrich\nthe text inputs. By matching the enhanced text features with mask-guided visual\nfeatures, we enable the mask classification, supporting open-vocabulary\nsemantic segmentation (OVSS). Third, at the global scale, we propose a\nCross-Scale Grad-CAM module to refine Grad-CAM maps using contextual\ninformation from global modifiers. A subsequent mask selection module\nintegrates pixel-level Grad-CAM activations into the mask-level segmentation\noutput, such that accurate and interpretable alignment can be realized across\nglobal and local dimensions for referring expression segmentation (RES)."}

Existing KG-based RAG\napproaches, however, generally assume that anchor entities are accessible to\ninitiate graph traversal, which limits their robustness in open world settings\nwhere accurate linking between the query and the entity is unreliable. To\novercome this limitation, we propose AnchorRAG, a novel multi-agent\ncollaboration framework for open-world RAG without the predefined anchor\nentities. Specifically, a predictor agent dynamically identifies candidate\nanchor entities by aligning user query terms with KG nodes and initializes\nindependent retriever agents to conduct parallel multi-hop explorations from\neach candidate.

To explore this interplay, we study a system size N=6, which\nprovides large storage capacity with moderate computational cost, and more\nimportantly, allows the stored energy to become almost fully extractable since\nthe ergotropy nearly coincides with the total capacity. We analyze three local\nnoise channels: bit flip, phase flip, and bit phase flip. We vary the strength\nof each channel to emulate frequent environmental monitoring, reminiscent of\nthe quantum Zeno effect, and track its influence on the charging dynamics and\nstored energy. The phase-flip channel slows charging under strong noise but\nstabilizes stored energy and ergotropy. The bit-flip channel enables faster\ncharging but saturates at low capacities, while the bit phase flip channel\ncombines both features.

Our core insight is that\nthe challenge is not merely to apply a better LLM, but to architect a decoupled\ncontrol plane that separates the AI's role of semantic reasoning (\"what to\noptimize\") from the system's role of execution (\"how to observe and act\").\nImplemented as Model Context Protocol(MCP) server, SchedCP provides a stable\ninterface with three key services: a Workload Analysis Engine, an evolving\nScheduler Policy Repository, and an Execution Verifier that validates all\nAI-generated code and configure before deployment with static and dynamic\nanalysis.\n  We demonstrate this architecture's power with sched-agent, a multi-agent\nsystem that autonomously analyzes workloads, synthesizes custom eBPF scheduling\npolicies, and deploys them via the sched\\_ext infrastructure. Our evaluation\nshows that SchedCP achieves up to an 1.79x performance improvement, and a 13x\ncost reduction compared to naive agentic approaches, all while maintaining high\nsuccess rate.

To determine the relevant data from prior\ndatasets, retrieval-based approaches most commonly calculate a prior data\npoint's minimum distance to a point in the target dataset in latent space.\nWhile retrieval-based methods have shown success using this metric for data\nselection, we demonstrate its equivalence to the limit of a Gaussian kernel\ndensity (KDE) estimate of the target data distribution.

Its primary obstacle,\nhowever, is decoherence often caused by spontaneous emission, which is\ninherently difficult to control. In contrast, superradiance offers a more\ncontrollable alternative. The temporal dynamics of superradiance can be tuned\nvia external experimental parameters, unlike those of spontaneous emission.\nIncorporating superradiance into quantum state engineering could therefore\nprovide more accessible control over quantum systems. Motivated by this, we\npresent a theoretical model for an ensemble of atoms in a V - type three -\nlevel configuration. Our numerical data are analyzed against key superradiance\ncharacteristics. The system successively emits a pair of superradiance pulses,\neffectively synthesizing the dynamically decoupled sub - ensembles into a\nsingle macroscopic ensemble involving all atoms. To our knowledge, this\nprocess, which we term superradiant synthesis, is demonstrated here for the\nfirst time.

Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the\ndynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual\nstimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel\nframework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and\nsemantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper\n(RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video\nReconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to\nextract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain\nregions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the\nTDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal\nconsistency between the feature representations and the original neural\nrecordings.

Deep learning methods such as CNN and Transformer\nhave been widely used in these domains. State Space Models recently highlighted\nthat prior methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity. As a result,\nmodeling longer-range dependencies of spatial-spectral features imposes an\noverwhelming burden on the network. Mamba solves this problem by incorporating\ntime-varying parameters into ordinary SSM and performing hardware optimization,\nbut it cannot perform feature fusion directly. In order to make full use of\nMamba's low computational burden and explore the potential of internal\nstructure in multimodal feature fusion, we propose Cross State Fusion Mamba\n(CSFMamba) Network. Specifically, we first design the preprocessing module of\nremote sensing image information for the needs of Mamba structure, and combine\nit with CNN to extract multi-layer features. Secondly, a cross-state module\nbased on Mamba operator is creatively designed to fully fuse the feature of the\ntwo modalities. The advantages of Mamba and CNN are combined by designing a\nmore powerful backbone. We capture the fusion relationship between HSI and\nLiDAR modalities with stronger full-image understanding.

However,\nprocessing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and\ndemands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced\nthroughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system\nefficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary\nobjective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In\nRAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval,\nwith only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often\nexhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during\nre-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those\nin standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most\ncomputations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be\neliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG,\nan efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve\nlatency in RAG applications.

We further demonstrate the versatility of SimulMEGA by extending it to\nstreaming TTS with a unidirectional backbone, yielding superior latency quality\ntradeoffs."}

Then, by incrementally introducing noisy exemplars,\nwe examine how the model balances pretrained priors against erroneous\nin-context information. Finally, we investigate whether prompt engineering can\ninduce slow thinking in large language models. Our extensive experiments reveal\nthree key findings: (1) The model not only quickly learns the reasoning\nstructure at the lexical level but also grasps deeper logical reasoning\npatterns, yet it heavily relies on pretrained priors. (2) Providing sufficient\nexemplars shifts the model's decision-making from pretrained priors to\nin-context signals, while misleading prompts introduce instability. (3) Long\nChain-of-Thought prompting can induce the model to generate longer reasoning\nchains, thereby improving its performance on downstream tasks."}

While\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) can generate code for search heuristics, their\napplication has largely been confined to adjusting simple functions within\nhuman-crafted frameworks, leaving their capacity for broader innovation an open\nquestion. To investigate this, we tasked an LLM with building a complete solver\nfor the constrained 3D Packing Problem. Direct code generation quickly proved\nfragile, prompting us to introduce two supports: constraint\nscaffolding--prewritten constraint-checking code--and iterative\nself-correction--additional refinement cycles to repair bugs and produce a\nviable initial population. Notably, even within a vast search space in a greedy\nprocess, the LLM concentrated its efforts almost exclusively on refining the\nscoring function. This suggests that the emphasis on scoring functions in prior\nwork may reflect not a principled strategy, but rather a natural limitation of\nLLM capabilities. The resulting heuristic was comparable to a human-designed\ngreedy algorithm, and when its scoring function was integrated into a\nhuman-crafted metaheuristic, its performance rivaled established solvers,\nthough its effectiveness waned as constraints tightened.

Here we\nexperimentally study the two-particle correlation dynamics via quantum walks in\nsuperconducting Bose-Hubbard qutrit arrays, with tunable on-site interaction\n$U$ realized by Floquet engineering. Quantum walks show the characteristic\nchange from bosonic bunching to fermionic antibunching with increasing $U$. The\ntwo-particle entanglement and quantum correlation dynamics, as measured by\nnegativity and quantum discord, are investigated. We find that depending on the\ninitial state, the propagation of entanglement can be strongly suppressed with\nincreasing $U$, while that of quantum discord exhibits considerably larger\namplitude; or both of them appear insensitive to $U$. Furthermore, the forms of\nentanglement are found to persist throughout particle walks for $U =$ 0 and it\nis generally not the case when $U$ increases.

Since blurring artifacts usually undermine pose\nestimation, pose errors could be accumulated to produce inferior reconstruction\nresults. To address this issue, we introduce a unified optimization framework\nby incorporating camera poses as learnable parameters complementary to 3DGS\nattributes for end-to-end optimization. Specifically, we recast camera and\nobject motion as per-primitive SE(3) affine transformations on 3D Gaussians and\nformulate a unified optimization objective. For stable optimization, we\nintroduce a three-stage training schedule that optimizes camera poses and\nGaussians alternatively.

This appeals to the\nstrengths of both the quantum and classical hardware; where state-sampling is\nclassically hard, the quantum computer can provide computational advantage in\nthe selection of high quality configuration subspaces, while the final\nmolecular energies are evaluated by solving an interaction matrix on HPC and is\ntherefore not corrupted by hardware noise. In this work, we present an\nalgorithm that leverages stochastic Hamiltonian time evolution in\nQuantum-Selected Configuration Interaction (QSCI), with multireference\nperturbation theory capturing missed correlations outside the configuration\nsubspace. The approach is validated through a hardware demonstration utilising\n42 qubits of an IQM superconducting device to calculate the potential energy\ncurve of the inorganic silane molecule, SiH4 using a 6-31G atomic orbital basis\nset, under a stretching of the Si-H bond length. In the regime of strong\ncorrelation we obtain energies comparable to Heatbath Configuration\nInteraction, but with a configuration space more than 200 times smaller,\nproviding the first evidence that QSCI can produce more compact representations\nof the ground state wavefunction compared with conventional heuristics.

However, the current transfer learning model greatly\ndepends on the source domain and target domain data, which hinder the practical\napplication of emotion recognition. Therefore, we propose a Multi-domain\nAggregation Transfer Learning framework for EEG emotion recognition with\nDomain-Class prototype under unseen targets (MATL-DC). We design the feature\ndecoupling module to decouple class-invariant domain features from\ndomain-invariant class features from shallow features. In the model training\nstage, the multi-domain aggregation mechanism aggregates the domain feature\nspace to form a superdomain, which enhances the characteristics of emotional\nEEG signals. In each superdomain, we further extract the class prototype\nrepresentation by class features. In addition, we adopt the pairwise learning\nstrategy to transform the sample classification problem into the similarity\nproblem between sample pairs, which effectively alleviates the influence of\nlabel noise. It is worth noting that the target domain is completely unseen\nduring the training process. In the inference stage, we use the trained\ndomain-class prototypes for inference, and then realize emotion recognition.

Existing state-of-the-art approaches typically extract\nnews semantic clues, such as writing patterns that include emotional words,\nstylistic features, etc. However, detectors tuned solely to such semantic clues\ncan easily fall into surface detection patterns, which can shift rapidly in\ndynamic environments, leading to limited performance in the evolving news\nlandscape. To address this issue, this paper investigates a novel perspective\nby incorporating news intent into fake news detection, bridging intents and\nsemantics together. The core insight is that by considering news intents, one\ncan deeply understand the inherent thoughts behind news deception, rather than\nthe surface patterns within words alone. To achieve this goal, we propose\nGraph-based Intent-Semantic Joint Modeling (InSide) for fake news detection,\nwhich models deception clues from both semantic and intent signals via\ngraph-based joint learning.

To answer this\nquestion, we systematically evaluate 7 LLMs (e.g., GPT and Gemini family)\nacross 6 benchmarks, including both multiple-choice and open-ended tasks on 12\ndiverse prompt templates. We find that much of the prompt sensitivity stems\nfrom heuristic evaluation methods, including log-likelihood scoring and rigid\nanswer matching, which often overlook semantically correct responses expressed\nthrough alternative phrasings, such as synonyms or paraphrases. When we adopt\nLLM-as-a-Judge evaluations, we observe a substantial reduction in performance\nvariance and a consistently higher correlation in model rankings across\nprompts.

We propose a novel parameterization that leverages a\nsingle linear layer to capture intrinsic correlations among hand joints. This\nis enabled by formulating the hand joint output space as a probabilistic\ndistribution, allowing the linear layer to capture joint correlations. Our\nproposed parameterization is used as a task head layer, and can be applied as\nan add-on module on top of the existing models. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat our parameterization for uncertainty modeling outperforms existing\napproaches. Furthermore, the 3D hand pose estimation model equipped with our\nuncertainty head achieves favorable accuracy in 3D hand pose estimation while\nintroducing new uncertainty modeling capability to the model.

Extensive SOFA surgical dynamic\nsimulations demonstrate JEDP-RL's three key advantages over proximal policy\noptimization (PPO) baselines: 1) Convergence speed: 3.2x faster policy\nconvergence, 2) Navigation efficiency: requires 25% fewer steps to reach the\ntarget, and 3) Generalization ability: achieve 92% success rate under material\nproperty variations and achieve 83% (33% higher than PPO) success rate in the\nunseen tissue environment."}

Our results reveal that\nwhile explicit label definitions can enhance accuracy and explainability, their\nintegration into an LLM's task-solving processes is neither guaranteed nor\nconsistent, suggesting reliance on internalized representations in many cases.\nModels often default to their internal representations, particularly in general\ntasks, whereas domain-specific tasks benefit more from explicit definitions.\nThese findings underscore the need for a deeper understanding of how LLMs\nprocess external knowledge alongside their pre-existing capabilities."}

In\naddition, as the volume of patient data grows, long-term storage of all\nhistorical data becomes increasingly burdensome as training samples to\nrecognize new patterns and classify existing ECG signals accurately. Therefore,\nto enhance the performance of anomaly detection while addressing storage\nlimitations, we propose a pseudo-replay based semi-supervised continual\nlearning framework, which consists of two components: unsupervised\nidentification and replay-based detection. For unsupervised identification, an\nunsupervised generative adversarial network (GAN)-based framework is integrated\nto detect novel patterns. Besides, instead of directly storing all historical\ndata, a pseudo replay-based learning strategy is proposed which utilizes a\ngenerator to learn the data distribution for each individual task. When a new\ntask arises, the generator synthesizes pseudo data representative of previous\nlearnt classes, enabling the model to detect both the existed patterns and the\nnewly presented anomalies. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is\nvalidated in four public ECG datasets, which leverages supervised\nclassification problems for anomaly detection.

MILO is trained using pseudo-MOS (Mean Opinion Score)\nsupervision, in which reproducible distortions are applied to diverse images\nand scored via an ensemble of recent quality metrics that account for visual\nmasking effects. This approach enables accurate learning without requiring\nlarge-scale human-labeled datasets. Despite its compact architecture, MILO\noutperforms existing metrics across standard FR-IQA benchmarks and offers fast\ninference suitable for real-time applications. Beyond quality prediction, we\ndemonstrate the utility of MILO as a perceptual loss in both image and latent\ndomains. In particular, we show that spatial masking modeled by MILO, when\napplied to latent representations from a VAE encoder within Stable Diffusion,\nenables efficient and perceptually aligned optimization. By combining spatial\nmasking with a curriculum learning strategy, we first process perceptually less\nrelevant regions before progressively shifting the optimization to more\nvisually distorted areas. This strategy leads to significantly improved\nperformance in tasks like denoising, super-resolution, and face restoration,\nwhile also reducing computational overhead.

VARIN\nleverages a novel pseudo-inverse function for argmax sampling, named\nLocation-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI), to generate inverse Gumbel noises. These\ninverse noises enable precise reconstruction of the source image and facilitate\ntargeted, controllable edits aligned with textual prompts. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that VARIN effectively modifies source images according\nto specified prompts while significantly preserving the original background and\nstructural details, thus validating its efficacy as a practical editing\napproach."}

In contrast, the unstructured paradigm\ncenters on scaling transformer architectures with increasingly vast data and\nmodel sizes, as seen in modern large language models. Despite their divergence,\nthis thesis seeks to establish conceptual connections bridging these paradigms.\nTwo complementary forces, structure and destructure, emerge across both\nparadigms: structure organizes seen symbolic interactions, while destructure,\nthrough periodic embedding resets, improves model plasticity and generalization\nto unseen scenarios. These connections form a new recipe for developing general\nknowledge engines that can support transparent, controllable, and adaptable\nintelligent systems."}

Object-centric learning aims\nto mimic this process in an unsupervised manner. Recently, the slot\nattention-based framework has emerged as a leading approach in this area and\nhas been widely used in various downstream tasks. However, existing slot\nattention methods face two key limitations: (1) a lack of high-level semantic\ninformation. In current methods, image areas are assigned to slots based on\nlow-level features such as color and texture. This makes the model overly\nsensitive to low-level features and limits its understanding of object\ncontours, shapes, or other semantic characteristics. (2) The inability to\nfine-tune the encoder.

While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary\nobjective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration.

This paper addresses\nthe problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image\nclassification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal\nAdaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy\nlabels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution\nLearning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in\nordinal labels.

In medical imaging, the analysis of complex shapes - such as\norgans, tissues, or other anatomical structures - combined with the often\nanisotropic nature of high-dimensional images complicates these adaptations. In\nthis study, we critically examine the role of Positional Encodings (PEs),\narguing that commonly used approaches may be suboptimal for the specific\nchallenges of medical imaging. Sinusoidal Positional Encodings (SPEs) have\nproven effective in vision tasks, but they struggle to preserve Euclidean\ndistances in higher-dimensional spaces. Isotropic Fourier Feature Positional\nEncodings (IFPEs) have been proposed to better preserve Euclidean distances,\nbut they lack the ability to account for anisotropy in images. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE),\na generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and\ndomain-specific spatial dependencies. We systematically benchmark AFPE against\ncommonly used PEs on multi-label classification in chest X-rays, organ\nclassification in CT images, and ejection fraction regression in\nechocardiography. Our results demonstrate that choosing the correct PE can\nsignificantly improve model performance. We show that the optimal PE depends on\nthe shape of the structure of interest and the anisotropy of the data.

However, a fundamental question remains: Can LLMs effectively utilize\ncausal knowledge for prediction and generation? Through empirical studies, we\nfind that LLMs trained directly on large-scale data often capture spurious\ncorrelations rather than true causal relationships, leading to suboptimal\nperformance, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address this\nchallenge, we propose Causal Attention Tuning (CAT), a novel approach that\ninjects fine-grained causal knowledge into the attention mechanism. We propose\nan automated pipeline that leverages human priors to automatically generate\ntoken-level causal signals and introduce the Re-Attention mechanism to guide\ntraining, helping the model focus on causal structures while mitigating noise\nand biases in attention scores. Experimental results on our proposed Spurious\nToken Game (STG) benchmark and multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that our\napproach effectively leverages causal knowledge for prediction and remains\nrobust in OOD scenarios.

One such approach to few-shot\nimitation learning is retrieval-based imitation learning, which extracts\nrelevant samples from large, widely available prior datasets to augment a\nlimited demonstration dataset. To determine the relevant data from prior\ndatasets, retrieval-based approaches most commonly calculate a prior data\npoint's minimum distance to a point in the target dataset in latent space.\nWhile retrieval-based methods have shown success using this metric for data\nselection, we demonstrate its equivalence to the limit of a Gaussian kernel\ndensity (KDE) estimate of the target data distribution.

GS-TG addresses a critical\ntrade-off issue in 3D-GS rendering: increasing the tile size effectively\nreduces redundant sorting operations, but it concurrently increases unnecessary\nrasterization computations.

To\naddress these limitations, we introduce SATQuest, a systematic verifier\ndesigned to evaluate and enhance logical reasoning in LLMs by generating\ndiverse, Satisfiability-based logical reasoning problems directly from\nConjunctive Normal Form (CNF) instances. SATQuest structures these problems\nalong three orthogonal dimensions: instance scale, problem type, and question\nformat, employing randomized, SAT-based problem generation and objective answer\nverification via PySAT. This design mitigates memorization issues, allows for\nnuanced insights into reasoning performance, and enables effective\nreinforcement fine-tuning. Our extensive evaluation of various LLMs using\nSATQuest identified significant limitations in their logical reasoning,\nparticularly in generalizing beyond familiar mathematical formats.

While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary\nobjective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration.

While this approach\nachieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles\nwith precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced\ndivision of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a\ntranslator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the\ngeneration module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring\nthe original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the\nnew content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding\nmodule is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning\ntasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce\nDraw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i)\nDIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex\ninstruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K\nchain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design\nblueprints for image edits.

VariAntNet significantly outperforms an existing\nanalytical solution, achieving more than double the convergence rate while\nmaintaining high swarm connectivity across varying swarm sizes.

Existing speech-driven approaches often produce oversimplified,\nemotionally flat, and semantically inconsistent results, which are insufficient\nfor singing animation. To address this, we propose Think2Sing, a\ndiffusion-based framework that leverages pretrained large language models to\ngenerate semantically coherent and temporally consistent 3D head animations,\nconditioned on both lyrics and acoustics. A key innovation is the introduction\nof motion subtitles, an auxiliary semantic representation derived through a\nnovel Singing Chain-of-Thought reasoning process combined with acoustic-guided\nretrieval. These subtitles contain precise timestamps and region-specific\nmotion descriptions, serving as interpretable motion priors. We frame the task\nas a motion intensity prediction problem, enabling finer control over facial\nregions and improving the modeling of expressive motion.

In medical imaging, the analysis of complex shapes - such as\norgans, tissues, or other anatomical structures - combined with the often\nanisotropic nature of high-dimensional images complicates these adaptations. In\nthis study, we critically examine the role of Positional Encodings (PEs),\narguing that commonly used approaches may be suboptimal for the specific\nchallenges of medical imaging. Sinusoidal Positional Encodings (SPEs) have\nproven effective in vision tasks, but they struggle to preserve Euclidean\ndistances in higher-dimensional spaces. Isotropic Fourier Feature Positional\nEncodings (IFPEs) have been proposed to better preserve Euclidean distances,\nbut they lack the ability to account for anisotropy in images. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE),\na generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and\ndomain-specific spatial dependencies. We systematically benchmark AFPE against\ncommonly used PEs on multi-label classification in chest X-rays, organ\nclassification in CT images, and ejection fraction regression in\nechocardiography. Our results demonstrate that choosing the correct PE can\nsignificantly improve model performance. We show that the optimal PE depends on\nthe shape of the structure of interest and the anisotropy of the data.
