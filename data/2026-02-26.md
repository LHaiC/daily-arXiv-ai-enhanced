Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Generating multi-frame, action-rich visual narratives without fine-tuning faces a threefold tension: action text faithfulness, subject identity fidelity, and cross-frame background continuity. We propose StoryTailor, a zero-shot pipeline that runs on a single RTX 4090 (24 GB) and produces temporally coherent, identity-preserving image sequences from a long narrative prompt, per-subject references, and grounding boxes. Three synergistic modules drive the system: Gaussian-Centered Attention (GCA) to dynamically focus on each subject core and ease grounding-box overlaps; Action-Boost Singular Value Reweighting (AB-SVR) to amplify action-related directions in the text embedding space; and Selective Forgetting Cache (SFC) that retains transferable background cues, forgets nonessential history, and selectively surfaces retained cues to build cross-scene semantic ties. Compared with baseline methods, experiments show that CLIP-T improves by up to 10-15%, with DreamSim lower than strong baselines, while CLIP-I stays in a visually acceptable, competitive range. With matched resolution and steps on a 24 GB GPU, inference is faster than FluxKontext. Qualitatively, StoryTailor delivers expressive interactions and evolving yet stable scenes.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Forecasting dynamic scenes remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision, as limited observations make it difficult to capture coherent object-level motion and long-term temporal evolution. We present Motion Group-aware Gaussian Forecasting (MoGaF), a framework for long-term scene extrapolation built upon the 4D Gaussian Splatting representation. MoGaF introduces motion-aware Gaussian grouping and group-wise optimization to enforce physically consistent motion across both rigid and non-rigid regions, yielding spatially coherent dynamic representations. Leveraging this structured space-time representation, a lightweight forecasting module predicts future motion, enabling realistic and temporally stable scene evolution. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that MoGaF consistently outperforms existing baselines in rendering quality, motion plausibility, and long-term forecasting stability.

Abstract: Controllable driving scene generation is critical for realistic and scalable autonomous driving simulation, yet existing approaches struggle to jointly achieve photorealism and precise control. We introduce HorizonForge, a unified framework that reconstructs scenes as editable Gaussian Splats and Meshes, enabling fine-grained 3D manipulation and language-driven vehicle insertion. Edits are rendered through a noise-aware video diffusion process that enforces spatial and temporal consistency, producing diverse scene variations in a single feed-forward pass without per-trajectory optimization. To standardize evaluation, we further propose HorizonSuite, a comprehensive benchmark spanning ego- and agent-level editing tasks such as trajectory modifications and object manipulation. Extensive experiments show that Gaussian-Mesh representation delivers substantially higher fidelity than alternative 3D representations, and that temporal priors from video diffusion are essential for coherent synthesis. Combining these findings, HorizonForge establishes a simple yet powerful paradigm for photorealistic, controllable driving simulation, achieving an 83.4% user-preference gain and a 25.19% FID improvement over the second best state-of-the-art method.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as versatile solutions for zero-shot question answering (QA) across various domains. However, enabling VLMs to effectively comprehend structured graphs and perform accurate, efficient QA remains challenging. Existing approaches typically rely on one single graph topology representation (GTR), such as fixed-style visual images or unified text descriptions. This ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy often neglects model-specific and task-specific preferences, resulting in inaccurate or over-lengthy responses to graph-related queries. To address this, we propose the $\mbox{DynamicGTR}$ framework, which dynamically selects the optimal GTR for each query during inference, thereby enhancing the zero-shot graph QA capabilities of VLMs with a customizable accuracy and brevity trade-off. Extensive experiments show that DynamicGTR not only improves VLM-based graph algorithm QA performance but also successfully transfers the experience trained from synthetic graph algorithm tasks to real-world applications like link prediction and node classification, without any additional training. Additionally, DynamicGTR demonstrates strong transferability across tasks, domains, and models, suggesting its potential as a flexible solution for broad graph scenarios.

Abstract: Geometry-free view synthesis transformers have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance in Novel View Synthesis (NVS), outperforming traditional approaches that rely on explicit geometry modeling. Yet the factors governing their scaling with compute remain unclear. We present a systematic study of scaling laws for view synthesis transformers and derive design principles for training compute-optimal NVS models. Contrary to prior findings, we show that encoder-decoder architectures can be compute-optimal; we trace earlier negative results to suboptimal architectural choices and comparisons across unequal training compute budgets. Across several compute levels, we demonstrate that our encoder-decoder architecture, which we call the Scalable View Synthesis Model (SVSM), scales as effectively as decoder-only models, achieves a superior performance-compute Pareto frontier, and surpasses the previous state-of-the-art on real-world NVS benchmarks with substantially reduced training compute.

Abstract: Purpose: Curating large-scale datasets of operating room (OR) workflow, encompassing rare, safety-critical, or atypical events, remains operationally and ethically challenging. This data bottleneck complicates the development of ambient intelligence for detecting, understanding, and mitigating rare or safety-critical events in the OR.
  Methods: This work presents an OR video diffusion framework that enables controlled synthesis of rare and safety-critical events. The framework integrates a geometric abstraction module, a conditioning module, and a fine-tuned diffusion model to first transform OR scenes into abstract geometric representations, then condition the synthesis process, and finally generate realistic OR event videos. Using this framework, we also curate a synthetic dataset to train and validate AI models for detecting near-misses of sterile-field violations.
  Results: In synthesizing routine OR events, our method outperforms off-the-shelf video diffusion baselines, achieving lower FVD/LPIPS and higher SSIM/PSNR in both in- and out-of-domain datasets. Through qualitative results, we illustrate its ability for controlled video synthesis of counterfactual events. An AI model trained and validated on the generated synthetic data achieved a RECALL of 70.13% in detecting near safety-critical events. Finally, we conduct an ablation study to quantify performance gains from key design choices.
  Conclusion: Our solution enables controlled synthesis of routine and rare OR events from abstract geometric representations. Beyond demonstrating its capability to generate rare and safety-critical scenarios, we show its potential to support the development of ambient intelligence models.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multimodal learning that integrates genomics and histopathology has shown strong potential in cancer diagnosis, yet its clinical translation is hindered by the limited availability of paired histology-genomics data. Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a practical solution by transferring genomic supervision into histopathology models, enabling accurate inference using histology alone. However, existing KD methods rely on batch-local alignment, which introduces instability due to limited within-batch comparisons and ultimately degrades performance.
  To address these limitations, we propose Momentum Memory Knowledge Distillation (MoMKD), a cross-modal distillation framework driven by a momentum-updated memory. This memory aggregates genomic and histopathology information across batches, effectively enlarging the supervisory context available to each mini-batch. Furthermore, we decouple the gradients of the genomics and histology branches, preventing genomic signals from dominating histology feature learning during training and eliminating the modality-gap issue at inference time.
  Extensive experiments on the TCGA-BRCA benchmark (HER2, PR, and ODX classification tasks) and an independent in-house testing dataset demonstrate that MoMKD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MIL and multimodal KD baselines, delivering strong performance and generalization under histology-only inference. Overall, MoMKD establishes a robust and generalizable knowledge distillation paradigm for computational pathology.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Prompt learning has become a dominant paradigm for adapting vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP to downstream tasks without modifying pretrained weights. While extending prompts to both vision and text encoders across multiple transformer layers significantly boosts performance, it dramatically increases the number of trainable parameters, with state-of-the-art methods requiring millions of parameters and abandoning the parameter efficiency that makes prompt tuning attractive. In this work, we propose \textbf{MMLoP} (\textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{Lo}w-Rank \textbf{P}rompting), a framework that achieves deep multi-modal prompting with only \textbf{11.5K trainable parameters}, comparable to early text-only methods like CoOp. MMLoP parameterizes vision and text prompts at each transformer layer through a low-rank factorization, which serves as an implicit regularizer against overfitting on few-shot training data. To further close the accuracy gap with state-of-the-art methods, we introduce three complementary components: a self-regulating consistency loss that anchors prompted representations to frozen zero-shot CLIP features at both the feature and logit levels, a uniform drift correction that removes the global embedding shift induced by prompt tuning to preserve class-discriminative structure, and a shared up-projection that couples vision and text prompts through a common low-rank factor to enforce cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks and 11 diverse datasets demonstrate that MMLoP achieves a highly favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoff, outperforming the majority of existing methods including those with orders of magnitude more parameters, while achieving a harmonic mean of 79.70\% on base-to-novel generalization.

Abstract: We present FlowFixer, a refinement framework for subject-driven generation (SDG) that restores fine details lost during generation caused by changes in scale and perspective of a subject. FlowFixer proposes direct image-to-image translation from visual references, avoiding ambiguities in language prompts. To enable image-to-image training, we introduce a one-step denoising scheme to generate self-supervised training data, which automatically removes high-frequency details while preserving global structure, effectively simulating real-world SDG errors. We further propose a keypoint matching-based metric to properly assess fidelity in details beyond semantic similarities usually measured by CLIP or DINO. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowFixer outperforms state-of-the-art SDG methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, setting a new benchmark for high-fidelity subject-driven generation.

Abstract: Temporal Action Segmentation (TAS) requires dividing videos into action segments, yet the vast space of activities and alternative breakdowns makes collecting comprehensive datasets infeasible. Existing methods remain limited to closed vocabularies and fixed label sets. In this work, we explore the largely unexplored problem of Open-Vocabulary Zero-Shot Temporal Action Segmentation (OVTAS) by leveraging the strong zero-shot capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce a training-free pipeline that follows a segmentation-by-classification design: Frame-Action Embedding Similarity (FAES) matches video frames to candidate action labels, and Similarity-Matrix Temporal Segmentation (SMTS) enforces temporal consistency. Beyond proposing OVTAS, we present a systematic study across 14 diverse VLMs, providing the first broad analysis of their suitability for open-vocabulary action segmentation. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that OVTAS achieves strong results without task-specific supervision, underscoring the potential of VLMs for structured temporal understanding.

Abstract: We introduce the task of SVG extraction, which consists in translating specific visual inputs from an image into scalable vector graphics. Existing multimodal models achieve strong results when generating SVGs from clean renderings or textual descriptions, but they fall short in real-world scenarios where natural images introduce noise, clutter, and domain shifts. A central challenge in this direction is the lack of suitable benchmarks. To address this need, we introduce the WildSVG Benchmark, formed by two complementary datasets: Natural WildSVG, built from real images containing company logos paired with their SVG annotations, and Synthetic WildSVG, which blends complex SVG renderings into real scenes to simulate difficult conditions. Together, these resources provide the first foundation for systematic benchmarking SVG extraction. We benchmark state-of-the-art multimodal models and find that current approaches perform well below what is needed for reliable SVG extraction in real scenarios. Nonetheless, iterative refinement methods point to a promising path forward, and model capabilities are steadily improving

Abstract: Forest monitoring is critical for climate change mitigation. However, existing global tree height maps provide only static snapshots and do not capture temporal forest dynamics, which are essential for accurate carbon accounting. We introduce ECHOSAT, a global and temporally consistent tree height map at 10 m resolution spanning multiple years. To this end, we resort to multi-sensor satellite data to train a specialized vision transformer model, which performs pixel-level temporal regression. A self-supervised growth loss regularizes the predictions to follow growth curves that are in line with natural tree development, including gradual height increases over time, but also abrupt declines due to forest loss events such as fires. Our experimental evaluation shows that our model improves state-of-the-art accuracies in the context of single-year predictions. We also provide the first global-scale height map that accurately quantifies tree growth and disturbances over time. We expect ECHOSAT to advance global efforts in carbon monitoring and disturbance assessment. The maps can be accessed at https://github.com/ai4forest/echosat.

Abstract: Instrumented Timed Up and Go (TUG) analysis can support clinical and research decision-making, but robust and reproducible markerless pipelines are still limited. We present \textit{tugturn.py}, a Python-based workflow for 3D markerless TUG processing that combines phase segmentation, gait-event detection, spatiotemporal metrics, intersegmental coordination, and dynamic stability analysis. The pipeline uses spatial thresholds to segment each trial into stand, first gait, turning, second gait, and sit phases, and applies a relative-distance strategy to detect heel-strike and toe-off events within valid gait windows. In addition to conventional kinematics, \textit{tugturn} provides Vector Coding outputs and Extrapolated Center of Mass (XCoM)-based metrics. The software is configured through TOML files and produces reproducible artifacts, including HTML reports, CSV tables, and quality-assurance visual outputs. A complete runnable example is provided with test data and command-line instructions. This manuscript describes the implementation, outputs, and reproducibility workflow of \textit{tugturn} as a focused software contribution for markerless biomechanical TUG analysis.

Abstract: Medical Vision Language Models (VLMs) can change their answers when clinicians rephrase the same question, which raises deployment risks. We introduce Paraphrase Sensitivity Failure (PSF)-Med, a benchmark of 19,748 chest Xray questions paired with about 92,000 meaningpreserving paraphrases across MIMIC-CXR and PadChest. Across six medical VLMs, we measure yes/no flips for the same image and find flip rates from 8% to 58%. However, low flip rate does not imply visual grounding: text-only baselines show that some models stay consistent even when the image is removed, suggesting they rely on language priors. To study mechanisms in one model, we apply GemmaScope 2 Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to MedGemma 4B and analyze FlipBank, a curated set of 158 flip cases. We identify a sparse feature at layer 17 that correlates with prompt framing and predicts decision margin shifts. In causal patching, removing this feature's contribution recovers 45% of the yesminus-no logit margin on average and fully reverses 15% of flips. Acting on this finding, we show that clamping the identified feature at inference reduces flip rates by 31% relative with only a 1.3 percentage-point accuracy cost, while also decreasing text-prior reliance. These results suggest that flip rate alone is not enough; robustness evaluations should test both paraphrase stability and image reliance.

Abstract: Unified Vision-Language Models (UVLMs) aim to advance multimodal learning by supporting both understanding and generation within a single framework. However, existing approaches largely focus on architectural unification while overlooking the need for explicit interaction between the two capabilities during task solving. As a result, current models treat understanding and generation as parallel skills rather than synergistic processes. To achieve real synergy, we introduce the interleaved Analyzing-Drafting problem-solving loop (AD-Loop), a new think paradigm that dynamically alternates between analytic and drafting operations. By interleaving textual thoughts with visual thoughts, AD-Loop enables models to iteratively refine both comprehension and outputs, fostering genuine synergy. To train this mechanism, we design a two-stage strategy: supervised learning on interleaved thought data to initialize alternation, followed by reinforcement learning to promote adaptive and autonomous control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AD-Loop consistently improves performance across standard benchmarks for both understanding and generation, with strong transferability to various UVLMs architectures. Visual analyses further validate the effectiveness of implicit visual thoughts. These results highlight AD-Loop as a principled and broadly applicable strategy for synergizing comprehension and creation. The project page is at https://sqwu.top/AD-Loop.

Abstract: Introduction: Deep learning-based segmentation models are increasingly integrated into clinical imaging workflows, yet their robustness to adversarial perturbations remains incompletely characterized, particularly for ultrasound images. We evaluated adversarial attacks and inference-time defenses for thyroid nodule segmentation in B-mode ultrasound. Methods: Two black-box adversarial attacks were developed: (1) Structured Speckle Amplification Attack (SSAA), which injects boundary-targeted noise, and (2) Frequency-Domain Ultrasound Attack (FDUA), which applies bandpass-filtered phase perturbations in the Fourier domain. Three inference-time mitigations were evaluated on adversarial images: randomized preprocessing with test-time augmentation, deterministic input denoising, and stochastic ensemble inference with consistency-aware aggregation. Experiments were conducted on a U-Net segmentation model trained on cine-clips from a database of 192 thyroid nodules. Results: The baseline model achieved a mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.76 (SD 0.20) on unperturbed images. SSAA reduced DSC by 0.29 (SD 0.20) while maintaining high visual similarity (SSIM = 0.94). FDUA resulted in a smaller DSC reduction of 0.11 (SD 0.09) with lower visual fidelity (SSIM = 0.82). Against SSAA, all three defenses significantly improved DSC after correction, with deterministic denoising showing the largest recovery (+0.10, p < 0.001), followed by randomized preprocessing (+0.09, p < 0.001), and stochastic ensemble inference (+0.08, p = 0.002). No defense achieved statistically significant improvement against FDUA. Conclusion: Spatial-domain adversarial perturbations in ultrasound segmentation showed partial mitigation with input preprocessing, whereas frequency-domain perturbations were not mitigated by the defenses, highlighting modality-specific challenges in adversarial robustness evaluation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A key challenge in translating Visual Place Recognition (VPR) from the lab to long-term deployment is ensuring a priori that a system can meet user-specified performance requirements across different parts of an environment, rather than just on average globally. A critical mechanism for controlling local VPR performance is the density of the reference mapping database, yet this factor is largely neglected in existing work, where benchmark datasets with fixed, engineering-driven (sensors, storage, GPS frequency) sampling densities are typically used. In this paper, we propose a dynamic VPR mapping approach that uses pairs of reference traverses from the target environment to automatically select an appropriate map density to satisfy two user-defined requirements: (1) a target Local Recall@1 level, and (2) the proportion of the operational environment over which this requirement must be met or exceeded, which we term the Recall Achievement Rate (RAR). Our approach is based on the hypothesis that match patterns between multiple reference traverses, evaluated across different map densities, can be modelled to predict the density required to meet these performance targets on unseen deployment data. Through extensive experiments across multiple VPR methods and the Nordland and Oxford RobotCar benchmarks, we show that our system consistently achieves or exceeds the specified local recall level over at least the user-specified proportion of the environment. Comparisons with alternative baselines demonstrate that our approach reliably selects the correct operating point in map density, avoiding unnecessary over-densification. Finally, ablation studies and analysis evaluate sensitivity to reference map choice and local space definitions, and reveal that conventional global Recall@1 is a poor predictor of the often more operationally meaningful RAR metric.

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving and robotic perception, yet its reliance on large-scale manually annotated data limits scalability and adaptability. To reduce annotation dependency, unsupervised and sparsely-supervised paradigms have emerged. However, they face intertwined challenges: low-quality pseudo-labels, unstable feature mining, and a lack of a unified training framework. This paper proposes SPL, a unified training framework for both Unsupervised and Sparsely-Supervised 3D Object Detection via Semantic Pseudo-labeling and prototype Learning. SPL first generates high-quality pseudo-labels by integrating image semantics, point cloud geometry, and temporal cues, producing both 3D bounding boxes for dense objects and 3D point labels for sparse ones. These pseudo-labels are not used directly but as probabilistic priors within a novel, multi-stage prototype learning strategy. This strategy stabilizes feature representation learning through memory-based initialization and momentum-based prototype updating, effectively mining features from both labeled and unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on KITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that SPL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both settings. Our work provides a robust and generalizable solution for learning 3D object detectors with minimal or no manual annotations.

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning ability by generating long chain-of-thought (CoT) responses. However, CoT reasoning in multimodal contexts is highly vulnerable to visual hallucination propagation: once an intermediate reasoning step becomes inconsistent with the visual evidence, subsequent steps-even if logically valid-can still lead to incorrect final answers. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate this issue by training models to "think with images" via reinforcement learning (RL). While effective, these methods are costly, model-specific, and difficult to generalize across architectures. Differently, we present a lightweight method that bypasses RL training and provides an iterative, training-free, plug-and-play framework for visually-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our key idea is to supervise each reasoning step at test time with visual evidence, ensuring that every decoded token is justified by corresponding visual cues. Concretely, we construct a textual visual-evidence pool that guides the model's reasoning generation. When existing evidence is insufficient, a visual decider module dynamically extracts additional relevant evidence from the image based on the ongoing reasoning context, expanding the pool until the model achieves sufficient visual certainty to terminate reasoning and produce the final answer. Extensive experiments on multiple LVLM backbones and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our method achieves 16.5%-29.5% improvements on TreeBench and 13.7% RH-AUC gains on RH-Bench, substantially reducing hallucination rates while improving reasoning accuracy without additional training.

Our framework addresses two key issues: adapting training-free 2D editing to structured 3D representations, and overcoming the bottleneck of appearance fidelity in compressed 3D features. To ensure geometric consistency, we introduce Voxel FlowEdit, an edit-driven flow in the sparse voxel latent space that achieves globally consistent 3D deformation in a single pass. To restore high-fidelity details, we develop a normal-guided single to multi-view generation module as an external appearance prior, successfully recovering high-frequency textures. Experiments demonstrate that our method enables fast, globally consistent, and high-fidelity 3D model editing.

Abstract: Identical twin face verification represents an extreme fine-grained recognition challenge where even state-of-the-art systems fail due to overwhelming genetic similarity. Current face recognition methods achieve over 99.8% accuracy on standard benchmarks but drop dramatically to 88.9% when distinguishing identical twins, exposing critical vulnerabilities in biometric security systems. The difficulty lies in learning features that capture subtle, non-genetic variations that uniquely identify individuals. We propose the Asymmetric Hierarchical Attention Network (AHAN), a novel architecture specifically designed for this challenge through multi-granularity facial analysis. AHAN introduces a Hierarchical Cross-Attention (HCA) module that performs multi-scale analysis on semantic facial regions, enabling specialized processing at optimal resolutions. We further propose a Facial Asymmetry Attention Module (FAAM) that learns unique biometric signatures by computing cross-attention between left and right facial halves, capturing subtle asymmetric patterns that differ even between twins. To ensure the network learns truly individuating features, we introduce Twin-Aware Pair-Wise Cross-Attention (TA-PWCA), a training-only regularization strategy that uses each subject's own twin as the hardest possible distractor. Extensive experiments on the ND_TWIN dataset demonstrate that AHAN achieves 92.3% twin verification accuracy, representing a 3.4% improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: AI agents with tool-use capabilities show promise for integrating the domain expertise of various tools. In the medical field, however, tools are usually AI models that are inherently error-prone and can produce contradictory responses. Existing research on medical agents lacks sufficient understanding of the tools' realistic reliability and thus cannot effectively resolve tool conflicts. To address this gap, this paper introduces a framework that enables an agent to interact with tools and empirically learn their practical trustworthiness across different types of multimodal queries via agentic learning. As a concrete instantiation, we focus on chest X-ray analysis and present a tool-expertise-aware chest X-ray agent (TEA-CXA). When tool outputs disagree, the agent experimentally accepts or rejects multimodal tool results, receives rewards, and learns which tool to trust for each query type. Importantly, TEA-CXA extends existing codebases for reinforcement learning with multi-turn tool-calling that focus on textual inputs, to support multimodal contexts effectively. In addition, we enhance the codebase for medical use scenarios by supporting multiple tool calls in one turn, parallel tool inference, and multi-image accommodation within a single user query. Our code framework is applicable to general medical research on multi-turn tool-calling reinforcement learning in multimodal settings. Experiments show that TEA-CXA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and a comprehensive set of baselines. Code will be released.

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction under unposed sparse viewpoints is a highly challenging yet practically important problem, especially in outdoor scenes due to complex lighting and scale variation. With extremely limited input views, directly utilizing diffusion model to synthesize pseudo frames will introduce unreasonable geometry, which will harm the final reconstruction quality. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework for sparse-view outdoor reconstruction that achieves high-quality results through bidirectional pseudo frame restoration and scene perception Gaussian management. Specifically, we introduce a bidirectional pseudo frame restoration method that restores missing content by diffusion-based synthesis guided by adjacent frames with a lightweight pseudo-view deblur model and confidence mask inference algorithm. Then we propose a scene perception Gaussian management strategy that optimize Gaussians based on joint depth-density information. These designs significantly enhance reconstruction completeness, suppress floating artifacts and improve overall geometric consistency under extreme view sparsity. Experiments on outdoor benchmarks demonstrate substantial gains over existing methods in both fidelity and stability.

Abstract: Retrospective MRI harmonization is limited by poor scalability across modalities and reliance on traveling subject datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce IHF-Harmony, a unified invertible hierarchy flow framework for multi-modality harmonization using unpaired data. By decomposing the translation process into reversible feature transformations, IHF-Harmony guarantees bijective mapping and lossless reconstruction to prevent anatomical distortion. Specifically, an invertible hierarchy flow (IHF) performs hierarchical subtractive coupling to progressively remove artefact-related features, while an artefact-aware normalization (AAN) employs anatomy-fixed feature modulation to accurately transfer target characteristics. Combined with anatomy and artefact consistency loss objectives, IHF-Harmony achieves high-fidelity harmonization that retains source anatomy. Experiments across multiple MRI modalities demonstrate that IHF-Harmony outperforms existing methods in both anatomical fidelity and downstream task performance, facilitating robust harmonization for large-scale multi-site imaging studies. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Accurate Couinaud liver segmentation is critical for preoperative surgical planning and tumor localization.However, existing methods primarily rely on image intensity and spatial location cues, without explicitly modeling vascular topology. As a result, they often produce indistinct boundaries near vessels and show limited generalization under anatomical variability.We propose VasGuideNet, the first Couinaud segmentation framework explicitly guided by vascular topology. Specifically, skeletonized vessels, Euclidean distance transform (EDT)--derived geometry, and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) connectivity are encoded into topology features using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). These features are then injected into a 3D encoder--decoder backbone via a cross-attention fusion module. To further improve inter-class separability and anatomical consistency, we introduce a Structural Contrastive Loss (SCL) with a global memory bank.On Task08_HepaticVessel and our private LASSD dataset, VasGuideNet achieves Dice scores of 83.68% and 76.65% with RVDs of 1.68 and 7.08, respectively. It consistently outperforms representative baselines including UNETR, Swin UNETR, and G-UNETR++, delivering higher Dice/mIoU and lower RVD across datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness for anatomically consistent segmentation.

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene understanding is essential for embodied intelligence, with occupancy prediction emerging as a key task for reasoning about both objects and free space. Existing approaches largely rely on depth priors (e.g., DepthAnything) but make only limited use of 3D cues, restricting performance and generalization. Recently, visual geometry models such as VGGT have shown strong capability in providing rich 3D priors, but similar to monocular depth foundation models, they still operate at the level of visible surfaces rather than volumetric interiors, motivating us to explore how to more effectively leverage these increasingly powerful geometry priors for 3D occupancy prediction. We present GPOcc, a framework that leverages generalizable visual geometry priors (GPs) for monocular occupancy prediction. Our method extends surface points inward along camera rays to generate volumetric samples, which are represented as Gaussian primitives for probabilistic occupancy inference. To handle streaming input, we further design a training-free incremental update strategy that fuses per-frame Gaussians into a unified global representation. Experiments on Occ-ScanNet and EmbodiedOcc-ScanNet demonstrate significant gains: GPOcc improves mIoU by +9.99 in the monocular setting and +11.79 in the streaming setting over prior state of the art. Under the same depth prior, it achieves +6.73 mIoU while running 2.65$\times$ faster. These results highlight that GPOcc leverages geometry priors more effectively and efficiently. Code will be released at https://github.com/JuIvyy/GPOcc.

Abstract: Pose-guided human image animation aims to synthesize realistic videos of a reference character driven by a sequence of poses. While diffusion-based methods have achieved remarkable success, most existing approaches are limited to single-character animation. We observe that naively extending these methods to multi-character scenarios often leads to identity confusion and implausible occlusions between characters. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an extensible multi-character image animation framework built upon modern Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for video generation. At its core, our framework introduces two novel components-Identifier Assigner and Identifier Adapter - which collaboratively capture per-person positional cues and inter-person spatial relationships. This mask-driven scheme, along with a scalable training strategy, not only enhances flexibility but also enables generalization to scenarios with more characters than those seen during training. Remarkably, trained on only a two-character dataset, our model generalizes to multi-character animation while maintaining compatibility with single-character cases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-character image animation, surpassing existing diffusion-based baselines.

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are essential for autonomous driving, yet multi-modal fusion often suffers from inconsistency between camera and LiDAR modalities, leading to performance degradation under low-light conditions, occlusions, or sparse point clouds. To address this, we propose SEFMAP, a Subspace-Expert Fusion framework for robust multimodal HD map prediction. The key idea is to explicitly disentangle BEV features into four semantic subspaces: LiDAR-private, Image-private, Shared, and Interaction. Each subspace is assigned a dedicated expert, thereby preserving modality-specific cues while capturing cross-modal consensus. To adaptively combine expert outputs, we introduce an uncertainty-aware gating mechanism at the BEV-cell level, where unreliable experts are down-weighted based on predictive variance, complemented by a usage balance regularizer to prevent expert collapse. To enhance robustness in degraded conditions and promote role specialization, we further propose distribution-aware masking: during training, modality-drop scenarios are simulated using EMA-statistical surrogate features, and a specialization loss enforces distinct behaviors of private, shared, and interaction experts across complete and masked inputs. Experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse2 benchmarks demonstrate that SEFMAP achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing prior methods by +4.2% and +4.8% in mAP, respectively. SEF-MAPprovides a robust and effective solution for multi-modal HD map prediction under diverse and degraded conditions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative image compression has demonstrated remarkable potential for achieving realistic reconstruction at ultra-low bitrates. The key to unlocking this potential lies in making the entire compression process content-adaptive, ensuring that the encoder's representation and the decoder's generative prior are dynamically aligned with the semantic and structural characteristics of the input image. However, existing methods suffer from three critical limitations that prevent effective content adaptation. First, isotropic quantization applies a uniform quantization step, failing to adapt to the spatially varying complexity of image content and creating a misalignment with the diffusion model's noise-dependent prior. Second, the information concentration bottleneck -- arising from the dimensional mismatch between the high-dimensional noisy latent and the diffusion decoder's fixed input -- prevents the model from adaptively preserving essential semantic information in the primary channels. Third, existing textual conditioning strategies either need significant textual bitrate overhead or rely on generic, content-agnostic textual prompts, thereby failing to provide adaptive semantic guidance efficiently. To overcome these limitations, we propose a content-adaptive diffusion-based image codec with three technical innovations: 1) an Uncertainty-Guided Adaptive Quantization method that learns spatial uncertainty maps to adaptively align quantization distortion with content characteristics; 2) an Auxiliary Decoder-Guided Information Concentration method that uses a lightweight auxiliary decoder to enforce content-aware information preservation in the primary latent channels; and 3) a Bitrate-Free Adaptive Textual Conditioning method that derives content-aware textual descriptions from the auxiliary reconstructed image, enabling semantic guidance without bitrate cost.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance in class-conditional and multimodal generation, yet the structure of their learned conditional embeddings remains poorly understood. In this work, we present the first systematic study of these embeddings and uncover a notable redundancy: class-conditioned embeddings exhibit extreme angular similarity, exceeding 99\% on ImageNet-1K, while continuous-condition tasks such as pose-guided image generation and video-to-audio generation reach over 99.9\%. We further find that semantic information is concentrated in a small subset of dimensions, with head dimensions carrying the dominant signal and tail dimensions contributing minimally. By pruning low-magnitude dimensions--removing up to two-thirds of the embedding space--we show that generation quality and fidelity remain largely unaffected, and in some cases improve. These results reveal a semantic bottleneck in Transformer-based diffusion models, providing new insights into how semantics are encoded and suggesting opportunities for more efficient conditioning mechanisms.

Abstract: Deep intracranial tumors situated in eloquent brain regions controlling vital functions present critical diagnostic challenges. Clinical practice has shifted toward stereotactic biopsy for pathological confirmation before treatment. Yet biopsy carries inherent risks of hemorrhage and neurological deficits and struggles with sampling bias due to tumor spatial heterogeneity, because pathological changes are typically region-selective rather than tumor-wide. Therefore, advancing non-invasive MRI-based pathology prediction is essential for holistic tumor assessment and modern clinical decision-making.
  The primary challenge lies in data scarcity: low tumor incidence requires long collection cycles, and annotation demands biopsy-verified pathology from neurosurgical experts. Additionally, tiny lesion volumes lacking segmentation masks cause critical features to be overwhelmed by background noise. To address these challenges, we construct the ICT-MRI dataset - the first public biopsy-verified benchmark with 249 cases across four categories. We propose a Virtual Biopsy framework comprising: MRI-Processor for standardization; Tumor-Localizer employing vision-language models for coarse-to-fine localization via weak supervision; and Adaptive-Diagnoser with a Masked Channel Attention mechanism fusing local discriminative features with global contexts. Experiments demonstrate over 90% accuracy, outperforming baselines by more than 20%.

Abstract: This paper presents a new unified approach to semantic segmentation in both images and videos by using language modeling to output the masks as sequences of discrete tokens. We use run length encoding (RLE) to discretize the segmentation masks and then train a modified version of Pix2Seq \cite{p2s} to output these RLE tokens through autoregression. We propose novel tokenization strategies to compress the length of the token sequence to make it practicable to extend this approach to videos. We also show how instance information can be incorporated into the tokenization process to perform panoptic segmentation. We evaluate our proposed models on two datasets to show that they are competitive with the state of the art in spite of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources.

Abstract: Hand motion plays a central role in human interaction, yet modeling realistic 4D hand motion (i.e., 3D hand pose sequences over time) remains challenging. Research in this area is typically divided into two tasks: (1) Estimation approaches reconstruct precise motion from visual observations, but often fail under hand occlusion or absence; (2) Generation approaches focus on synthesizing hand poses by exploiting generative priors under multi-modal structured inputs and infilling motion from incomplete sequences. However, this separation not only limits the effective use of heterogeneous condition signals that frequently arise in practice, but also prevents knowledge transfer between the two tasks. We present UniHand, a unified diffusion-based framework that formulates both estimation and generation as conditional motion synthesis. UniHand integrates heterogeneous inputs by embedding structured signals into a shared latent space through a joint variational autoencoder, which aligns conditions such as MANO parameters and 2D skeletons. Visual observations are encoded with a frozen vision backbone, while a dedicated hand perceptron extracts hand-specific cues directly from image features, removing the need for complex detection and cropping pipelines. A latent diffusion model then synthesizes consistent motion sequences from these diverse conditions. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that UniHand delivers robust and accurate hand motion modeling, maintaining performance under severe occlusions and temporally incomplete inputs.

Abstract: Clinicians commonly interpret three-dimensional (3D) medical images, such as computed tomography (CT) scans, using multiple anatomical planes rather than as a single volumetric representation. In this multi-planar approach, the axial plane typically serves as the primary acquisition and diagnostic reference, while the coronal and sagittal planes provide complementary spatial information to increase diagnostic confidence. However, many existing 3D deep learning methods either process volumetric data holistically or assign equal importance to all planes, failing to reflect the axial-centric clinical interpretation workflow. To address this gap, we propose an axial-centric cross-plane attention architecture for 3D medical image classification that captures the inherent asymmetric dependencies between different anatomical planes. Our architecture incorporates MedDINOv3, a medical vision foundation model pretrained via self-supervised learning on large-scale axial CT images, as a frozen feature extractor for the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes. RICA blocks and intra-plane transformer encoders capture plane-specific positional and contextual information within each anatomical plane, while axial-centric cross-plane transformer encoders condition axial features on complementary information from auxiliary planes. Experimental results on six datasets from the MedMNIST3D benchmark demonstrate that the proposed architecture consistently outperforms existing 3D and multi-plane models in terms of accuracy and AUC. Ablation studies further confirm the importance of axial-centric query-key-value allocation and directional cross-plane fusion. These results highlight the importance of aligning architectural design with clinical interpretation workflows for robust and data-efficient 3D medical image analysis.

Abstract: Foundation models have recently achieved impressive success in computational pathology, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse histopathology tasks. However, existing models overlook the heterogeneous and non-uniform organization of pathological regions of interest (ROIs) because they rely on natural image backbones not tailored for tissue morphology. Consequently, they often fail to capture the coherent tissue architecture beyond isolated patches, limiting interpretability and clinical relevance. To address these challenges, we present Cross-modal Adaptive Region Encoder (CARE), a foundation model for pathology that automatically partitions WSIs into several morphologically relevant regions. Specifically, CARE employs a two-stage pretraining strategy: (1) a self-supervised unimodal pretraining stage that learns morphological representations from 34,277 whole-slide images (WSIs) without segmentation annotations, and (2) a cross-modal alignment stage that leverages RNA and protein profiles to refine the construction and representation of adaptive regions. This molecular guidance enables CARE to identify biologically relevant patterns and generate irregular yet coherent tissue regions, selecting the most representative area as ROI. CARE supports a broad range of pathology-related tasks, using either the ROI feature or the slide-level feature obtained by aggregating adaptive regions. Based on only one-tenth of the pretraining data typically used by mainstream foundation models, CARE achieves superior average performance across 33 downstream benchmarks, including morphological classification, molecular prediction, and survival analysis, and outperforms other foundation model baselines overall.

Abstract: Modeling 4D scenes requires capturing both spatial structure and temporal motion, which is challenging due to the need for physically consistent representations of complex rigid and non-rigid motions. Existing approaches mainly rely on translational displacements, which struggle to represent rotations, articulated transformations, often leading to spatial inconsistency and physically implausible motion. LieFlow, a dynamic radiance representation framework that explicitly models motion within the SE(3) Lie group, enabling coherent learning of translation and rotation in a unified geometric space. The SE(3) transformation field enforces physically inspired constraints to maintain motion continuity and geometric consistency. The evaluation includes a synthetic dataset with rigid-body trajectories and two real-world datasets capturing complex motion under natural lighting and occlusions. Across all datasets, LieFlow consistently improves view-synthesis fidelity, temporal coherence, and physical realism over NeRF-based baselines. These results confirm that SE(3)-based motion modeling offers a robust and physically grounded framework for representing dynamic 4D scenes.

Abstract: Image captioning remains a fundamental task for vision language understanding, yet ground-truth supervision still relies predominantly on human-annotated references. Because human annotations reflect subjective preferences and expertise, ground-truth captions are often incomplete or even incorrect, which in turn limits caption models. We argue that caption quality should be assessed by two objective aspects: completeness (does the caption cover all salient visual facts?) and correctness (are the descriptions true with respect to the image?). To this end, we introduce CCCaption: a dual-reward reinforcement learning framework with a dedicated fine-tuning corpus that explicitly optimizes these properties to generate \textbf{C}omplete and \textbf{C}orrect \textbf{Captions}. For completeness, we use diverse LVLMs to disentangle the image into a set of visual queries, and reward captions that answer more of these queries, with a dynamic query sampling strategy to improve training efficiency. For correctness, we penalize captions that contain hallucinations by validating the authenticity of sub-caption queries, which are derived from the caption decomposition. Our symmetric dual-reward optimization jointly maximizes completeness and correctness, guiding models toward captions that better satisfy these objective criteria. Extensive experiments across standard captioning benchmarks show consistent improvements, offering a principled path to training caption models beyond human-annotation imitation.

Abstract: Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has significantly advanced automated chest X-ray diagnosis but remains isolated from clinical workflows and lacks reliable decision support and interpretability. Human-AI collaboration seeks to enhance the reliability of diagnostic models by integrating the behaviors of controllable radiologists. However, the absence of interactive tools seamlessly embedded within diagnostic routines impedes collaboration, while the semantic gap between radiologists' decision-making patterns and model representations further limits clinical adoption. To overcome these limitations, we propose a visual cognition-guided collaborative network (VCC-Net) to achieve the cooperative diagnostic paradigm. VCC-Net centers on visual cognition (VC) and employs clinically compatible interfaces, such as eye-tracking or the mouse, to capture radiologists' visual search traces and attention patterns during diagnosis. VCC-Net employs VC as a spatial cognition guide, learning hierarchical visual search strategies to localize diagnostically key regions. A cognition-graph co-editing module subsequently integrates radiologist VC with model inference to construct a disease-aware graph. The module captures dependencies among anatomical regions and aligns model representations with VC-driven features, mitigating radiologist bias and facilitating complementary, transparent decision-making. Experiments on the public datasets SIIM-ACR, EGD-CXR, and self-constructed TB-Mouse dataset achieved classification accuracies of 88.40%, 85.05%, and 92.41%, respectively. The attention maps produced by VCC-Net exhibit strong concordance with radiologists' gaze distributions, demonstrating a mutual reinforcement of radiologist and model inference.

Abstract: Learning-based point cloud compression presents superior performance to handcrafted codecs. However, pretrained-based methods, which are based on end-to-end training and expected to generalize to all the potential samples, suffer from training data dependency. Implicit neural representation (INR) based methods are distribution-agnostic and more robust, but they require time-consuming online training and suffer from the bitstream overhead from the overfitted model. To address these limitations, we propose HybridINR-PCGC, a novel hybrid framework that bridges the pretrained model and INR. Our framework retains distribution-agnostic properties while leveraging a pretrained network to accelerate convergence and reduce model overhead, which consists of two parts: the Pretrained Prior Network (PPN) and the Distribution Agnostic Refiner (DAR). We leverage the PPN, designed for fast inference and stable performance, to generate a robust prior for accelerating the DAR's convergence. The DAR is decomposed into a base layer and an enhancement layer, and only the enhancement layer needed to be packed into the bitstream. Finally, we propose a supervised model compression module to further supervise and minimize the bitrate of the enhancement layer parameters. Based on experiment results, HybridINR-PCGC achieves a significantly improved compression rate and encoding efficiency. Specifically, our method achieves a Bpp reduction of approximately 20.43% compared to G-PCC on 8iVFB. In the challenging out-of-distribution scenario Cat1B, our method achieves a Bpp reduction of approximately 57.85% compared to UniPCGC. And our method exhibits a superior time-rate trade-off, achieving an average Bpp reduction of 15.193% relative to the LINR-PCGC on 8iVFB.

Abstract: Collaborative perception allows connected vehicles to overcome occlusions and limited viewpoints by sharing sensory information. However, existing approaches struggle to achieve high accuracy under strict bandwidth constraints and remain highly vulnerable to random transmission packet loss. We introduce QPoint2Comm, a quantized point-cloud communication framework that dramatically reduces bandwidth while preserving high-fidelity 3D information. Instead of transmitting intermediate features, QPoint2Comm directly communicates quantized point-cloud indices using a shared codebook, enabling efficient reconstruction with lower bandwidth than feature-based methods. To ensure robustness to possible communication packet loss, we employ a masked training strategy that simulates random packet loss, allowing the model to maintain strong performance even under severe transmission failures. In addition, a cascade attention fusion module is proposed to enhance multi-vehicle information integration. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that QPoint2Comm sets a new state of the art in accuracy, communication efficiency, and resilience to packet loss.

Abstract: Generative AI is widely used to create commercial posters. However, rapid advances in generation have outpaced automated quality assessment. Existing models emphasize generic esthetics or low level distortions and lack the functional criteria required for e-commerce design. It is especially challenging for Chinese content, where complex characters often produce subtle but critical textual artifacts that are overlooked by existing methods. To address this, we introduce E-comIQ-ZH, a framework for evaluating Chinese e-commerce posters. We build the first dataset E-comIQ-18k to feature multi dimensional scores and expert calibrated Chain of Thought (CoT) rationales. Using this dataset, we train E-comIQ-M, a specialized evaluation model that aligns with human expert judgment. Our framework enables E-comIQ-Bench, the first automated and scalable benchmark for the generation of Chinese e-commerce posters. Extensive experiments show our E-comIQ-M aligns more closely with expert standards and enables scalable automated assessment of e-commerce posters. All datasets, models, and evaluation tools will be released to support future research in this area.Code will be available at https://github.com/4mm7/E-comIQ-ZH.

Abstract: Scene flow estimation is an extremely important task in computer vision to support the perception of dynamic changes in the scene. For robust scene flow, learning-based approaches have recently achieved impressive results using either image-based or LiDAR-based modalities. However, these methods have tended to focus on the use of a single modality. To tackle these problems, we present a deep learning architecture, SF3D-RGB, that enables sparse scene flow estimation using 2D monocular images and 3D point clouds (e.g., acquired by LiDAR) as inputs. Our architecture is an end-to-end model that first encodes information from each modality into features and fuses them together. Then, the fused features enhance a graph matching module for better and more robust mapping matrix computation to generate an initial scene flow. Finally, a residual scene flow module further refines the initial scene flow. Our model is designed to strike a balance between accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, experiments show that our proposed method outperforms single-modality methods and achieves better scene flow accuracy on real-world datasets while using fewer parameters compared to other state-of-the-art methods with fusion.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit outstanding performance on vision-language tasks but struggle with hallucination problems. Through in-depth analysis of LVLM activation patterns, we reveal two key findings: 1) truthfulness and visual perception capabilities predominantly engage different subsets of attention heads within the model architecture; and 2) truthfulness steering vectors vary significantly across different semantic contexts. Based on these observations, we propose Dynamic Multimodal Activation Steering, a training-free approach for hallucination mitigation. Our method constructs a semantic-based truthfulness steering vector database and computes visual perception steering vectors, enabling context-aware interventions during inference by dynamically selecting the most relevant steering vectors based on input semantic similarity and applying them to the most influential attention heads. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple models and datasets, demonstrating that our approach significantly enhances model performance, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Accurate cone localization in 3D space is essential in autonomous racing for precise navigation around the track. Approaches that rely on traditional computer vision algorithms are sensitive to environmental variations, and neural networks are often trained on limited data and are infeasible to run in real time. We present a UNet-based neural network for keypoint detection on cones, leveraging the largest custom-labeled dataset we have assembled. Our approach enables accurate cone position estimation and the potential for color prediction. Our model achieves substantial improvements in keypoint accuracy over conventional methods. Furthermore, we leverage our predicted keypoints in the perception pipeline and evaluate the end-to-end autonomous system. Our results show high-quality performance across all metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of this approach and its potential for adoption in competitive autonomous racing systems.

Abstract: Minimally invasive surgery has dramatically improved patient operative outcomes, yet identifying safe operative zones remains challenging in critical phases, requiring surgeons to integrate visual cues, procedural phase, and anatomical context under high cognitive load. Existing AI systems offer binary safety verification or static detection, ignoring the phase-dependent nature of intraoperative reasoning. We introduce ResGo, a benchmark of laparoscopic frames annotated with Go Zone bounding boxes and clinician-authored rationales covering phase, exposure quality reasoning, next action and risk reminder. We introduce evaluation metrics that treat correct grounding under incorrect phase as failures, revealing that most vision-language models cannot handle such tasks and perform poorly. We then present SurGo-R1, a model optimized via RLHF with a multi-turn phase-then-go architecture where the model first identifies the surgical phase, then generates reasoning and Go Zone coordinates conditioned on that context. On unseen procedures, SurGo-R1 achieves 76.6% phase accuracy, 32.7 mIoU, and 54.8% hardcore accuracy, a 6.6$\times$ improvement over the mainstream generalist VLMs. Code, model and benchmark will be available at https://github.com/jinlab-imvr/SurGo-R1

Abstract: Accurate forest stand delineation is essential for forest inventory and management but remains a largely manual and subjective process. A recent study has shown that deep learning can produce stand delineations comparable to expert interpreters when combining aerial imagery and airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. However, temporal misalignment between data sources limits operational scalability. Canopy height models (CHMs) derived from digital photogrammetry (DAP) offer better temporal alignment but may smoothen canopy surface and canopy gaps, raising the question of whether they can reliably replace ALS-derived CHMs. Similarly, the inclusion of a digital terrain model (DTM) has been suggested to improve delineation performance, but has remained untested in published literature. Using expert-delineated forest stands as reference data, we assessed a U-Net-based semantic segmentation framework with municipality-level cross-validation across six municipalities in southeastern Norway. We compared multispectral aerial imagery combined with (i) an ALS-derived CHM, (ii) a DAP-derived CHM, and (iii) a DAP-derived CHM in combination with a DTM. Results showed comparable performance across all data combinations, reaching overall accuracy values between 0.90-0.91. Agreement between model predictions was substantially larger than agreement with the reference data, highlighting both model consistency and the inherent subjectivity of stand delineation. The similar performance of DAP-CHMs, despite the reduced structural detail, and the lack of improvements of the DTM indicate that the framework is resilient to variations in input data. These findings indicate that large datasets for deep learning-based stand delineations can be assembled using projects including temporally aligned ALS data and DAP point clouds.

Abstract: Tooth image segmentation is a cornerstone of dental digitization. However, traditional image encoders relying on fixed-resolution feature maps often lead to discontinuous segmentation and poor discrimination between target regions and background, due to insufficient modeling of environmental and global context. Moreover, transformer-based self-attention introduces substantial computational overhead because of its quadratic complexity (O(n^2)), making it inefficient for high-resolution dental images. To address these challenges, we introduce a three-stage encoder with hierarchical feature representation to capture scale-adaptive information in dental images. By jointly leveraging low-level details and high-level semantics through cross-scale feature fusion, the model effectively preserves fine structural information while maintaining strong contextual awareness. Furthermore, a bidirectional sequence modeling strategy is incorporated to enhance global spatial context understanding without incurring high computational cost.
  We validate our method on two dental datasets, with experimental results demonstrating its superiority over existing approaches. On the OralVision dataset, our model achieves a 1.1% improvement in mean intersection over union (mIoU).

Abstract: Rapid advances in AI-generated image (AIGI) technology enable highly realistic synthesis, threatening public information integrity and security. Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating texture-level artifact features alongside semantic features into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can enhance their AIGI detection capability. However, our preliminary analyses reveal that artifact features exhibit high intra-feature similarity, leading to an almost uniform attention map after the softmax operation. This phenomenon causes attention dilution, thereby hindering effective fusion between semantic and artifact features. To overcome this limitation, we propose a lightweight fusion adapter, TranX-Adapter, which integrates a Task-aware Optimal-Transport Fusion that leverages the Jensen-Shannon divergence between artifact and semantic prediction probabilities as a cost matrix to transfer artifact information into semantic features, and an X-Fusion that employs cross-attention to transfer semantic information into artifact features. Experiments on standard AIGI detection benchmarks upon several advanced MLLMs, show that our TranX-Adapter brings consistent and significant improvements (up to +6% accuracy).

Abstract: Large-scale, volumetric medical imaging datasets typically aggregate scans from different vendors and devices, resulting in highly variable resolution, slice thicknesses, and numbers of slices per study. Consequently, training representation models usually requires cropping or interpolating along the z-axis to obtain fixed-size blocks, which inevitably causes information loss. We propose a new training approach to overcome this limitation. Instead of absolute position embeddings, we interpret volumes as sequences of 3D chunks and adopt Rotary Position Embeddings, allowing us to treat the z-axis as an unconstrained temporal dimensions. Building on this idea, we introduce a new vision-language model: SigVLP. In SigVLP, we implement Rotary Position Embedding as the positional encoding method, which is applied directly within the attention operation, generating input-conditioned sine and cosine weights on the fly. This design ensures consistent alignment between query and key projections and adapts to any input sizes. To allow for variable input size during training, we sample Computed Tomography volumes in chunks and pair them with localized organ-wise textual observations. Compared to using entire reports for conditioning, chunkwise alignment provides finer-grained supervision, enabling the model to establish stronger correlations between the text and volume representations, thereby improving the precision of text-to-volume alignment. Our models are trained with the Muon optimizer and evaluated on a diverse set of downstream tasks, including zero-shot abnormality and organ classification, segmentation, and retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) for colonoscopy is hampered by the domain gap between simulated and real-world images. Existing image-to-image translation methods, which use depth as a posterior constraint, often produce structural distortions and specular highlights by failing to balance realism with structure consistency. To address this, we propose a Structure-to-Image paradigm that transforms the depth map from a passive constraint into an active generative foundation. We are the first to introduce phase congruency to colonoscopic domain adaptation and design a cross-level structure constraint to co-optimize geometric structures and fine-grained details like vascular textures. In zero-shot evaluations conducted on a publicly available phantom dataset, the MDE model that was fine-tuned on our generated data achieved a maximum reduction of 44.18% in RMSE compared to competing methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models. Extending these methods to multimodal settings, however, faces a critical challenge: the instability of std-based normalization, which is easily distorted by extreme samples with nearly positive or negative rewards. Unlike pure-text LLMs, multimodal models are particularly sensitive to such distortions, as both perceptual and reasoning errors influence their responses. To address this, we characterize each sample by its difficulty, defined through perceptual complexity (measured via visual entropy) and reasoning uncertainty (captured by model confidence). Building on this characterization, we propose difficulty-aware group normalization (Durian), which re-groups samples by difficulty levels and shares the std within each group. Our approach preserves GRPO's intra-group distinctions while eliminating sensitivity to extreme cases, yielding significant performance gains across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Advanced autonomous systems rely on multi-sensor fusion for safer and more robust perception. To enable effective fusion, calibrating directly from natural driving scenes (i.e., target-free) with high accuracy is crucial for precise multi-sensor alignment. Existing learning-based calibration methods are typically designed for only a single pair of sensor modalities (i.e., a bi-modal setup). Unlike these methods, we propose LiREC-Net, a target-free, learning-based calibration network that jointly calibrates multiple sensor modality pairs, including LiDAR, RGB, and event data, within a unified framework. To reduce redundant computation and improve efficiency, we introduce a shared LiDAR representation that leverages features from both its 3D nature and projected depth map, ensuring better consistency across modalities. Trained and evaluated on established datasets, such as KITTI and DSEC, our LiREC-Net achieves competitive performance to bi-modal models and sets a new strong baseline for the tri-modal use case.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in high-fidelity image, video, and audio generation, yet inference remains computationally expensive. Nevertheless, current diffusion acceleration methods based on distributed parallelism suffer from noticeable generation artifacts and fail to achieve substantial acceleration proportional to the number of GPUs. Therefore, we propose a hybrid parallelism framework that combines a novel data parallel strategy, condition-based partitioning, with an optimal pipeline scheduling method, adaptive parallelism switching, to reduce generation latency and achieve high generation quality in conditional diffusion models. The key ideas are to (i) leverage the conditional and unconditional denoising paths as a new data-partitioning perspective and (ii) adaptively enable optimal pipeline parallelism according to the denoising discrepancy between these two paths. Our framework achieves $2.31\times$ and $2.07\times$ latency reductions on SDXL and SD3, respectively, using two NVIDIA RTX~3090 GPUs, while preserving image quality. This result confirms the generality of our approach across U-Net-based diffusion models and DiT-based flow-matching architectures. Our approach also outperforms existing methods in acceleration under high-resolution synthesis settings. Code is available at https://github.com/kaist-dmlab/Hybridiff.

Abstract: Single-point annotation is increasingly prominent in visual tasks for labeling cost reduction. However, it challenges tasks requiring high precision, such as the point-prompted instance segmentation (PPIS) task, which aims to estimate precise masks using single-point prompts to train a segmentation network. Due to the constraints of point annotations, granularity ambiguity and boundary uncertainty arise the difficulty distinguishing between different levels of detail (eg. whole object vs. parts) and the challenge of precisely delineating object boundaries. Previous works have usually inherited the paradigm of mask generation along with proposal selection to achieve PPIS. However, proposal selection relies solely on category information, failing to resolve the ambiguity of different granularity. Furthermore, mask generators offer only finite discrete solutions that often deviate from actual masks, particularly at boundaries. To address these issues, we propose the Semantic-Aware Point-Prompted Instance Segmentation Network (SAPNet). It integrates Point Distance Guidance and Box Mining Strategy to tackle group and local issues caused by the point's granularity ambiguity. Additionally, we incorporate completeness scores within proposals to add spatial granularity awareness, enhancing multiple instance learning (MIL) in proposal selection termed S-MIL. The Multi-level Affinity Refinement conveys pixel and semantic clues, narrowing boundary uncertainty during mask refinement. These modules culminate in SAPNet++, mitigating point prompt's granularity ambiguity and boundary uncertainty and significantly improving segmentation performance. Extensive experiments on four challenging datasets validate the effectiveness of our methods, highlighting the potential to advance PPIS.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has achieved remarkable success in semantic alignment, yet state-of-the-art models frequently fail to render physically plausible results when editing involves complex causal dynamics, such as refraction or material deformation. We attribute this limitation to the dominant paradigm that treats editing as a discrete mapping between image pairs, which provides only boundary conditions and leaves transition dynamics underspecified. To address this, we reformulate physics-aware editing as predictive physical state transitions and introduce PhysicTran38K, a large-scale video-based dataset comprising 38K transition trajectories across five physical domains, constructed via a two-stage filtering and constraint-aware annotation pipeline. Building on this supervision, we propose PhysicEdit, an end-to-end framework equipped with a textual-visual dual-thinking mechanism. It combines a frozen Qwen2.5-VL for physically grounded reasoning with learnable transition queries that provide timestep-adaptive visual guidance to a diffusion backbone. Experiments show that PhysicEdit improves over Qwen-Image-Edit by 5.9% in physical realism and 10.1% in knowledge-grounded editing, setting a new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, while remaining competitive with leading proprietary models.

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for deepfake detection excel at identifying spatial artifacts but overlook a critical dimension: temporal inconsistencies in video forgeries. Adapting VLMs to reason about these dynamic cues remains a distinct challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose Forensic Answer-Questioning (FAQ), a large-scale benchmark that formulates temporal deepfake analysis as a multiple-choice task. FAQ introduces a three-level hierarchy to progressively evaluate and equip VLMs with forensic capabilities: (1) Facial Perception, testing the ability to identify static visual artifacts; (2) Temporal Deepfake Grounding, requiring the localization of dynamic forgery artifacts across frames; and (3) Forensic Reasoning, challenging models to synthesize evidence for final authenticity verdicts. We evaluate a range of VLMs on FAQ and generate a corresponding instruction-tuning set, FAQ-IT. Extensive experiments show that models fine-tuned on FAQ-IT achieve advanced performance on both in-domain and cross-dataset detection benchmarks. Ablation studies further validate the impact of our key design choices, confirming that FAQ is the driving force behind the temporal reasoning capabilities of these VLMs.

Abstract: Learning-based 3D visual geometry models have significantly advanced with the advent of large-scale transformers. Among these, StreamVGGT leverages frame-wise causal attention to deliver robust and efficient streaming 3D reconstruction. However, it suffers from unbounded growth in the Key-Value (KV) cache due to the massive influx of vision tokens from multi-image and long-video inputs, leading to increased memory consumption and inference latency as input frames accumulate. This ultimately limits its scalability for long-horizon applications. To address this gap, we propose XStreamVGGT, a tuning-free approach that seamlessly integrates pruning and quantization to systematically compress the KV cache, enabling extremely memory-efficient streaming inference. Specifically, redundant KVs generated from multi-frame inputs are initially pruned to conform to a fixed KV memory budget using an efficient token-importance identification mechanism that maintains full compatibility with high-performance attention kernels (e.g., FlashAttention). Additionally, leveraging the inherent distribution patterns of KV tensors, we apply dimension-adaptive KV quantization within the pruning pipeline to further minimize memory overhead while preserving numerical accuracy. Extensive evaluations show that XStreamVGGT achieves mostly negligible performance degradation while substantially reducing memory usage by 4.42$\times$ and accelerating inference by 5.48$\times$, enabling practical and scalable streaming 3D applications. The code is available at https://github.com/ywh187/XStreamVGGT/.

Abstract: Motion segmentation in dynamic scenes is highly challenging, as conventional methods heavily rely on estimating camera poses and point correspondences from inherently noisy motion cues. Existing statistical inference or iterative optimization techniques that struggle to mitigate the cumulative errors in multi-stage pipelines often lead to limited performance or high computational cost. In contrast, we propose a fully learning-based approach that directly infers moving objects from latent feature representations via attention mechanisms, thus enabling end-to-end feed-forward motion segmentation. Our key insight is to bypass explicit correspondence estimation and instead let the model learn to implicitly disentangle object and camera motion. Supported by recent advances in 4D scene geometry reconstruction (e.g., $π^3$), the proposed method leverages reliable camera poses and rich spatial-temporal priors, which ensure stable training and robust inference for the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by eliminating complex pre-processing and iterative refinement, our approach achieves state-of-the-art motion segmentation performance with high efficiency.

Abstract: SkyReels V4 is a unified multi modal video foundation model for joint video audio generation, inpainting, and editing. The model adopts a dual stream Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) architecture, where one branch synthesizes video and the other generates temporally aligned audio, while sharing a powerful text encoder based on the Multimodal Large Language Models (MMLM). SkyReels V4 accepts rich multi modal instructions, including text, images, video clips, masks, and audio references. By combining the MMLMs multi modal instruction following capability with in context learning in the video branch MMDiT, the model can inject fine grained visual guidance under complex conditioning, while the audio branch MMDiT simultaneously leverages audio references to guide sound generation. On the video side, we adopt a channel concatenation formulation that unifies a wide range of inpainting style tasks, such as image to video, video extension, and video editing under a single interface, and naturally extends to vision referenced inpainting and editing via multi modal prompts. SkyReels V4 supports up to 1080p resolution, 32 FPS, and 15 second duration, enabling high fidelity, multi shot, cinema level video generation with synchronized audio. To make such high resolution, long-duration generation computationally feasible, we introduce an efficiency strategy: Joint generation of low resolution full sequences and high-resolution keyframes, followed by dedicated super-resolution and frame interpolation models. To our knowledge, SkyReels V4 is the first video foundation model that simultaneously supports multi-modal input, joint video audio generation, and a unified treatment of generation, inpainting, and editing, while maintaining strong efficiency and quality at cinematic resolutions and durations.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic visual experiences from brain activity provides a compelling avenue for exploring the neural mechanisms of human visual perception. While recent progress in fMRI-based image reconstruction has been notable, extending this success to video reconstruction remains a significant challenge. Current fMRI-to-video reconstruction approaches consistently encounter two major shortcomings: (i) inconsistent visual representations of salient objects across frames, leading to appearance mismatches; (ii) poor temporal coherence, resulting in motion misalignment or abrupt frame transitions. To address these limitations, we introduce SemVideo, a novel fMRI-to-video reconstruction framework guided by hierarchical semantic information. At the core of SemVideo is SemMiner, a hierarchical guidance module that constructs three levels of semantic cues from the original video stimulus: static anchor descriptions, motion-oriented narratives, and holistic summaries. Leveraging this semantic guidance, SemVideo comprises three key components: a Semantic Alignment Decoder that aligns fMRI signals with CLIP-style embeddings derived from SemMiner, a Motion Adaptation Decoder that reconstructs dynamic motion patterns using a novel tripartite attention fusion architecture, and a Conditional Video Render that leverages hierarchical semantic guidance for video reconstruction. Experiments conducted on the CC2017 and HCP datasets demonstrate that SemVideo achieves superior performance in both semantic alignment and temporal consistency, setting a new state-of-the-art in fMRI-to-video reconstruction.

Abstract: We propose Light-Geometry Interaction (LGI) maps, a novel representation that encodes light-aware occlusion from monocular depth. Unlike ray tracing, which requires full 3D reconstruction, LGI captures essential light-shadow interactions reliably and accurately, computed from off-the-shelf 2.5D depth map predictions. LGI explicitly ties illumination direction to geometry, providing a physics-inspired prior that constrains generative models. Without such prior, these models often produce floating shadows, inconsistent illumination, and implausible shadow geometry. Building on this representation, we propose a unified pipeline for joint shadow generation and relighting - unlike prior methods that treat them as disjoint tasks - capturing the intrinsic coupling of illumination and shadowing essential for modeling indirect effects. By embedding LGI into a bridge-matching generative backbone, we reduce ambiguity and enforce physically consistent light-shadow reasoning. To enable effective training, we curated the first large-scale benchmark dataset for joint shadow and relighting, covering reflections, transparency, and complex interreflections. Experiments show significant gains in realism and consistency across synthetic and real images. LGI thus bridges geometry-inspired rendering with generative modeling, enabling efficient, physically consistent shadow generation and relighting.

Abstract: Visual storytelling models that correctly ground entities in images may still hallucinate semantic relationships, generating incorrect dialogue attribution, character interactions, or emotional states. We introduce StoryMovie, a dataset of 1,757 stories aligned with movie scripts and subtitles through LCS matching. Our alignment pipeline synchronizes screenplay dialogue with subtitle timestamps, enabling dialogue attribution by linking character names from scripts to temporal positions from subtitles. Using this aligned content, we generate stories that maintain visual grounding tags while incorporating authentic character names, dialogue, and relationship dynamics. We fine-tune Qwen Storyteller3 on this dataset, building on prior work in visual grounding and entity re-identification. Evaluation using DeepSeek V3 as judge shows that Storyteller3 achieves an 89.9% win rate against base Qwen2.5-VL 7B on subtitle alignment. Compared to Storyteller, trained without script grounding,
  Storyteller3 achieves 48.5% versus 38.0%, confirming that semantic alignment progressively improves dialogue attribution beyond visual grounding alone.

Abstract: Video foundation models aim to integrate video understanding, generation, editing, and instruction following within a single framework, making them a central direction for next-generation multimodal systems. However, existing evaluation benchmarks remain fragmented and limited in scope, as they each target a single task, rely on task-specific metrics, and typically use short or simple video clips. As a result, they do not capture the unified capabilities that these models are designed to deliver. To address this gap, we introduce UniVBench, a benchmark purpose-built for evaluating video foundation models across four core abilities: video understanding, video generation, video editing, and a newly proposed task, video reconstruction, which assesses how faithfully a model can reproduce video content it has encountered. Our benchmark substantially expands the complexity of evaluation by incorporating 200 high-quality, diverse and multi-shot videos, each paired with detailed captions, multi-format editing instructions, and reference images. All videos are human-created and carefully validated, offering richer cinematic information than prior benchmarks. In addition, we develop a unified agentic evaluation system (UniV-Eval) that standardizes prompting, instruction parsing, and scoring across all tasks, enabling fair, scalable, and reproducible comparisons of unified video models. By grounding evaluation in instruction-based multi-shot video tasks, UniVBench provides the first framework for measuring the integrated capabilities that video foundation models aim to achieve. Extensive human annotations ensure our evaluation aligns with human judgment, enabling rigorous assessment and accelerating progress toward robust video intelligence.

Abstract: Deep learning-based watermarking has made remarkable progress in recent years. To achieve robustness against various distortions, current methods commonly adopt a training strategy where a \underline{\textbf{s}}ingle \underline{\textbf{r}}andom \underline{\textbf{d}}istortion (SRD) is chosen as the noise layer in each training batch. However, the SRD strategy treats distortions independently within each batch, neglecting the inherent relationships among different types of distortions and causing optimization conflicts across batches. As a result, the robustness and generalizability of the watermarking model are limited. To address this issue, we propose a novel training strategy that enhances robustness and generalization via \underline{\textbf{meta}}-learning with \underline{\textbf{f}}eature \underline{\textbf{c}}onsistency (Meta-FC). Specifically, we randomly sample multiple distortions from the noise pool to construct a meta-training task, while holding out one distortion as a simulated ``unknown'' distortion for the meta-testing phase. Through meta-learning, the model is encouraged to identify and utilize neurons that exhibit stable activations across different types of distortions, mitigating the optimization conflicts caused by the random sampling of diverse distortions in each batch. To further promote the transformation of stable activations into distortion-invariant representations, we introduce a feature consistency loss that constrains the decoded features of the same image subjected to different distortions to remain consistent. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to the SRD training strategy, Meta-FC improves the robustness and generalization of various watermarking models by an average of 1.59\%, 4.71\%, and 2.38\% under high-intensity, combined, and unknown distortions.

Abstract: Object hallucination is a critical issue in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where outputs include objects that do not appear in the input image. A natural question arises from this phenomenon: Which component of the LVLM pipeline primarily contributes to object hallucinations? The vision encoder to perceive visual information, or the language decoder to generate text responses? In this work, we strive to answer this question through designing a systematic experiment to analyze the roles of the vision encoder and the language decoder in hallucination generation. Our observations reveal that object hallucinations are predominantly associated with the strong priors from the language decoder. Based on this finding, we propose a simple and training-free framework, No-Language-Hallucination Decoding, NoLan, which refines the output distribution by dynamically suppressing language priors, modulated based on the output distribution difference between multimodal and text-only inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that NoLan effectively reduces object hallucinations across various LVLMs on different tasks. For instance, NoLan achieves substantial improvements on POPE, enhancing the accuracy of LLaVA-1.5 7B and Qwen-VL 7B by up to 6.45 and 7.21, respectively. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/lingfengren/NoLan.

Abstract: Accurate annotation of endoscopic videos is essential yet time-consuming, particularly for challenging datasets such as dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus, where the affected regions are irregular and lack clear boundaries. Semi-automatic tools like Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can ease this process by propagating annotations across frames, but small errors often accumulate and reduce accuracy, requiring expert review and correction. To address this, we systematically study how annotation errors propagate across different prompt types, namely masks, boxes, and points, and propose Learning-to-Re-Prompt (L2RP), a cost-aware framework that learns when and where to seek expert input. By tuning a human-cost parameter, our method balances annotation effort and segmentation accuracy. Experiments on a private Barrett's dysplasia dataset and the public SUN-SEG benchmark demonstrate improved temporal consistency and superior performance over baseline strategies.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) facilitates the secure utilization of decentralized images, advancing applications in medical image recognition and autonomous driving. However, conventional FL faces two critical challenges in real-world deployment: ineffective knowledge fusion caused by model updates biased toward majority-class features, and prohibitive communication overhead due to frequent transmissions of high-dimensional model parameters. Inspired by the human brain's efficiency in knowledge integration, we propose a novel Generative Federated Prototype Learning (GFPL) framework to address these issues. Within this framework, a prototype generation method based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) captures the statistical information of class-wise features, while a prototype aggregation strategy using Bhattacharyya distance effectively fuses semantically similar knowledge across clients. In addition, these fused prototypes are leveraged to generate pseudo-features, thereby mitigating feature distribution imbalance across clients. To further enhance feature alignment during local training, we devise a dual-classifier architecture, optimized via a hybrid loss combining Dot Regression and Cross-Entropy. Extensive experiments on benchmarks show that GFPL improves model accuracy by 3.6% under imbalanced data settings while maintaining low communication cost.

Abstract: Image memorability, i.e., how likely an image is to be remembered, has traditionally been studied in computer vision either as a passive prediction task, with models regressing a scalar score, or with generative methods altering the visual input to boost the image likelihood of being remembered. Yet, none of these paradigms supports users at capture time, when the crucial question is how to improve a photo memorability. We introduce the task of Memorability Feedback (MemFeed), where an automated model should provide actionable, human-interpretable guidance to users with the goal to enhance an image future recall. We also present MemCoach, the first approach designed to provide concrete suggestions in natural language for memorability improvement (e.g., "emphasize facial expression," "bring the subject forward"). Our method, based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), is training-free and employs a teacher-student steering strategy, aligning the model internal activations toward more memorable patterns learned from a teacher model progressing along least-to-most memorable samples. To enable systematic evaluation on this novel task, we further introduce MemBench, a new benchmark featuring sequence-aligned photoshoots with annotated memorability scores. Our experiments, considering multiple MLLMs, demonstrate the effectiveness of MemCoach, showing consistently improved performance over several zero-shot models. The results indicate that memorability can not only be predicted but also taught and instructed, shifting the focus from mere prediction to actionable feedback for human creators.

Abstract: Accurate depth estimation plays a critical role in the navigation of endoscopic surgical robots, forming the foundation for 3D reconstruction and safe instrument guidance. Fine-tuning pretrained models heavily relies on endoscopic surgical datasets with precise depth annotations. While existing self-supervised depth estimation techniques eliminate the need for accurate depth annotations, their performance degrades in environments with weak textures and variable lighting, leading to sparse reconstruction with invalid depth estimation. Depth completion using sparse depth maps can mitigate these issues and improve accuracy. Despite the advances in depth completion techniques in general fields, their application in endoscopy remains limited. To overcome these limitations, we propose EndoDDC, an endoscopy depth completion method that integrates images, sparse depth information with depth gradient features, and optimizes depth maps through a diffusion model, addressing the issues of weak texture and light reflection in endoscopic environments. Extensive experiments on two publicly available endoscopy datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models in both depth accuracy and robustness. This demonstrates the potential of our method to reduce visual errors in complex endoscopic environments. Our code will be released at https://github.com/yinheng-lin/EndoDDC.

Abstract: Clouds are a major obstacle in Earth observation, limiting the usability and reliability of critical remote sensing applications such as fire disaster response, urban heat island monitoring, and snow and ice cover mapping. Therefore, the ability to detect clouds 24/7 is of paramount importance. While visible and near-infrared bands are effective for daytime cloud detection, their dependence on solar illumination makes them unsuitable for nighttime monitoring. In contrast, thermal infrared (TIR) imagery plays a crucial role in detecting clouds at night, when sunlight is absent. Due to their generally lower temperatures, clouds emit distinct thermal signatures that are detectable in TIR bands. Despite this, accurate nighttime cloud detection remains challenging due to limited spectral information and the typically lower spatial resolution of TIR imagery. To address these challenges, we present TIRAuxCloud, a multi-modal dataset centered around thermal spectral data to facilitate cloud segmentation under both daytime and nighttime conditions. The dataset comprises a unique combination of multispectral data (TIR, optical, and near-infrared bands) from Landsat and VIIRS, aligned with auxiliary information layers. Elevation, land cover, meteorological variables, and cloud-free reference images are included to help reduce surface-cloud ambiguity and cloud formation uncertainty. To overcome the scarcity of manual cloud labels, we include a large set of samples with automated cloud masks and a smaller manually annotated subset to further evaluate and improve models. Comprehensive benchmarks are presented to establish performance baselines through supervised and transfer learning, demonstrating the dataset's value in advancing the development of innovative methods for day and night time cloud detection.

Abstract: We present a geometry-aware method for heterogeneous single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstruction that predicts atomic backbone conformations. To incorporate protein-structure priors, we represent the backbone as a graph and use a graph neural network (GNN) autodecoder that maps per-image latent variables to 3D displacements of a template conformation. The objective combines a data-discrepancy term based on a differentiable cryo-EM forward model with geometric regularization, and it supports unknown orientations via ellipsoidal support lifting (ESL) pose estimation. On synthetic datasets derived from molecular dynamics trajectories, the proposed GNN achieves higher accuracy compared to a multilayer perceptron (MLP) of comparable size, highlighting the benefits of a geometry-informed inductive bias.

Abstract: Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) image restoration is trapped in a scalability crisis: existing models, bound to pixel-wise operations, demand unsustainable computation. While state space models (SSMs) like Mamba promise linear complexity, their pixel-serial scanning remains a fundamental bottleneck for the millions of pixels in UHD content. We ask: must we process every pixel to understand the image? This paper introduces C$^2$SSM, a visual state space model that breaks this taboo by shifting from pixel-serial to cluster-serial scanning. Our core discovery is that the rich feature distribution of a UHD image can be distilled into a sparse set of semantic centroids via a neural-parameterized mixture model. C$^2$SSM leverages this to reformulate global modeling into a novel dual-path process: it scans and reasons over a handful of cluster centers, then diffuses the global context back to all pixels through a principled similarity distribution, all while a lightweight modulator preserves fine details. This cluster-centric paradigm achieves a decisive leap in efficiency, slashing computational costs while establishing new state-of-the-art results across five UHD restoration tasks. More than a solution, C$^2$SSM charts a new course for efficient large-scale vision: scan clusters, not pixels.

Abstract: Scene-consistent video generation aims to create videos that explore 3D scenes based on a camera trajectory. Previous methods rely on video generation models with external memory for consistency, or iterative 3D reconstruction and inpainting, which accumulate errors during inference due to incorrect intermediary outputs, non-differentiable processes, and separate models. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ``geometry-as-context". It iteratively completes the following steps using an autoregressive camera-controlled video generation model: (1) estimates the geometry of the current view necessary for 3D reconstruction, and (2) simulates and restores novel view images rendered by the 3D scene. Under this multi-task framework, we develop the camera gated attention module to enhance the model's capability to effectively leverage camera poses. During the training phase, text contexts are utilized to ascertain whether geometric or RGB images should be generated. To ensure that the model can generate RGB-only outputs during inference, the geometry context is randomly dropped from the interleaved text-image-geometry training sequence. The method has been tested on scene video generation with one-direction and forth-and-back trajectories. The results show its superiority over previous approaches in maintaining scene consistency and camera control.

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring is a key predictor of cardiovascular risk, but it relies on ECG-gated CT scans, restricting its use to specialized cardiac imaging settings. We introduce an automated framework for CAC detection and lesion-specific Agatston scoring that operates across both gated and non-gated CT scans. At its core is CARD-ViT, a self-supervised Vision Transformer trained exclusively on gated CT data using DINO. Without any non-gated training data, our framework achieves 0.707 accuracy and a Cohen's kappa of 0.528 on the Stanford non-gated dataset, matching models trained directly on non-gated scans. On gated test sets, the framework achieves 0.910 accuracy with Cohen's kappa scores of 0.871 and 0.874 across independent datasets, demonstrating robust risk stratification. These results demonstrate the feasibility of cross-domain CAC scoring from gated to non-gated domains, supporting scalable cardiovascular screening in routine chest imaging without additional scans or annotations.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) progresses as a continuous and irreversible deterioration of the retina, following a well-defined clinical trajectory from mild to severe stages. However, most existing ordinal regression approaches model DR severity as a set of static, symmetric ranks, capturing relative order while ignoring the inherent unidirectional nature of disease progression. As a result, the learned feature representations may violate biological plausibility, allowing implausible proximity between non-consecutive stages or even reverse transitions. To bridge this gap, we propose Directed Ordinal Diffusion Regularization (D-ODR), which explicitly models the feature space as a directed flow by constructing a progression-constrained directed graph that strictly enforces forward disease evolution. By performing multi-scale diffusion on this directed structure, D-ODR imposes penalties on score inversions along valid progression paths, thereby effectively preventing the model from learning biologically inconsistent reverse transitions. This mechanism aligns the feature representation with the natural trajectory of DR worsening. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D-ODR yields superior grading performance compared to state-of-the-art ordinal regression and DR-specific grading methods, offering a more clinically reliable assessment of disease severity. Our code is available on https://github.com/HovChen/D-ODR.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of vision impairment worldwide. However, manual diagnosis is often time-consuming and prone to errors, leading to delays in screening. This paper presents a lightweight automated deep learning framework for efficient assessment of DR severity from digital fundus images. We use a MobileNetV3 architecture with a Consistent Rank Logits (CORAL) head to model the ordered progression of disease while maintaining computational efficiency for resource-constrained environments. The model is trained and validated on a combined dataset of APTOS 2019 and IDRiD images using a preprocessing pipeline including circular cropping and illumination normalization. Extensive experiments including 3-fold cross-validation and ablation studies demonstrate strong performance. The model achieves a Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) score of 0.9019 and an accuracy of 80.03 percent. Additionally, we address real-world deployment challenges through model calibration to reduce overconfidence and optimization for mobile devices. The proposed system provides a scalable and practical tool for early-stage diabetic retinopathy screening.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of vision loss worldwide, making early and accurate DR grading critical for timely intervention. Recent clinical practices leverage multi-view fundus images for DR detection with a wide coverage of the field of view (FOV), motivating deep learning methods to explore the potential of multi-view learning for DR grading. However, existing methods often overlook the inter-view correlations when fusing multi-view fundus images, failing to fully exploit the inherent consistency across views originating from the same patient. In this work, we present MVGFDR, an end-to-end Multi-View Graph Fusion framework for DR grading. Different from existing methods that directly fuse visual features from multiple views, MVGFDR is equipped with a novel Multi-View Graph Fusion (MVGF) module to explicitly disentangle the shared and view-specific visual features. Specifically, MVGF comprises three key components: (1) Multi-view Graph Initialization, which constructs visual graphs via residual-guided connections and employs Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients as frequency-domain anchors; (2) Multi-view Graph Fusion, which integrates selective nodes across multi-view graphs based on frequency-domain relevance to capture complementary view-specific information; and (3) Masked Cross-view Reconstruction, which leverages masked reconstruction of shared information across views to facilitate view-invariant representation learning. Extensive experimental results on MFIDDR, by far the largest multi-view fundus image dataset, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over existing state-of-the-art approaches in diabetic retinopathy grading.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLM) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, showing promise for end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Chain-of-Thought (CoT), as VLM's widely used reasoning strategy, is facing critical challenges. Existing textual CoT has a large gap between text semantic space and trajectory physical space. Although the recent approach utilizes future image to replace text as CoT process, it lacks clear planning-oriented objective guidance to generate images with accurate scene evolution. To address these, we innovatively propose MindDriver, a progressive multimodal reasoning framework that enables VLM to imitate human-like progressive thinking for autonomous driving. MindDriver presents semantic understanding, semantic-to-physical space imagination, and physical-space trajectory planning. To achieve aligned reasoning processes in MindDriver, we develop a feedback-guided automatic data annotation pipeline to generate aligned multimodal reasoning training data. Furthermore, we develop a progressive reinforcement fine-tuning method to optimize the alignment through progressive high- level reward-based learning. MindDriver demonstrates superior performance in both nuScences open-loop and Bench2Drive closed-loop evaluation. Codes are available at https://github.com/hotdogcheesewhite/MindDriver.

Abstract: Text Image Machine Translation (TIMT) aims to translate text embedded in images in the source-language into target-language, requiring synergistic integration of visual perception and linguistic understanding. Existing TIMT methods, whether cascaded pipelines or end-to-end multimodal large language models (MLLMs),struggle with high-resolution text-rich images due to cluttered layouts, diverse fonts, and non-textual distractions, resulting in text omission, semantic drift, and contextual inconsistency. To address these challenges, we propose GLoTran, a global-local dual visual perception framework for MLLM-based TIMT. GLoTran integrates a low-resolution global image with multi-scale region-level text image slices under an instruction-guided alignment strategy, conditioning MLLMs to maintain scene-level contextual consistency while faithfully capturing fine-grained textual details. Moreover, to realize this dual-perception paradigm, we construct GLoD, a large-scale text-rich TIMT dataset comprising 510K high-resolution global-local image-text pairs covering diverse real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GLoTran substantially improves translation completeness and accuracy over state-of-the-art MLLMs, offering a new paradigm for fine-grained TIMT under high-resolution and text-rich conditions.

It decomposes denoising into local texture extraction and global context aggregation, fused via a spatially aware patch fusion strategy. This design enables effective noise suppression while preserving fine structural and anatomical details. PatchDenoiser is ultra-lightweight, with far fewer parameters and lower computational complexity than CNN-, GAN-, and transformer-based denoisers.
  On the 2016 Mayo Low-Dose CT dataset, PatchDenoiser consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CNN- and GAN-based methods in PSNR and SSIM. It is robust to variations in slice thickness, reconstruction kernels, and HU windows, generalizes across scanners without fine-tuning, and reduces parameters by ~9x and energy consumption per inference by ~27x compared with conventional CNN denoisers.
  PatchDenoiser thus provides a practical, scalable, and computationally efficient solution for medical image denoising, balancing performance, robustness, and clinical deployability.

Abstract: The pose graph is a core component of Structure-from-Motion (SfM), where images act as nodes and edges encode relative poses. Since geometric verification is expensive, SfM pipelines restrict the pose graph to a sparse set of candidate edges, making initialization critical. Existing methods rely on image retrieval to connect each image to its $k$ nearest neighbors, treating pairs independently and ignoring global consistency. We address this limitation through the concept of edge prioritization, ranking candidate edges by their utility for SfM. Our approach has three components: (1) a GNN trained with SfM-derived supervision to predict globally consistent edge reliability; (2) multi-minimal-spanning-tree-based pose graph construction guided by these ranks; and (3) connectivity-aware score modulation that reinforces weak regions and reduces graph diameter. This globally informed initialization yields more reliable and compact pose graphs, improving reconstruction accuracy in sparse and high-speed settings and outperforming SOTA retrieval methods on ambiguous scenes. The ode and trained models are available at https://github.com/weitong8591/global_edge_prior.

Abstract: Metro trains often operate in highly complex environments, characterized by illumination variations, high-speed motion, and adverse weather conditions. These factors pose significant challenges for visual perception systems, especially those relying solely on conventional RGB cameras. To tackle these difficulties, we explore the integration of event cameras into the perception system, leveraging their advantages in low-light conditions, high-speed scenarios, and low power consumption. Specifically, we focus on Kilometer Marker Recognition (KMR), a critical task for autonomous metro localization under GNSS-denied conditions. In this context, we propose a robust baseline method based on a pre-trained RGB OCR foundation model, enhanced through multi-modal adaptation. Furthermore, we construct the first large-scale RGB-Event dataset, EvMetro5K, containing 5,599 pairs of synchronized RGB-Event samples, split into 4,479 training and 1,120 testing samples. Extensive experiments on EvMetro5K and other widely used benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for KMR. Both the dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/EvMetro5K_benchmark

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a leading technique for efficiently fine-tuning text-to-image diffusion models, and its widespread adoption on open-source platforms has fostered a vibrant culture of model sharing and customization. However, the same modular and plug-and-play flexibility that makes LoRA appealing also introduces a broader attack surface. To highlight this risk, we propose Masquerade-LoRA (MasqLoRA), the first systematic attack framework that leverages an independent LoRA module as the attack vehicle to stealthily inject malicious behavior into text-to-image diffusion models. MasqLoRA operates by freezing the base model parameters and updating only the low-rank adapter weights using a small number of "trigger word-target image" pairs. This enables the attacker to train a standalone backdoor LoRA module that embeds a hidden cross-modal mapping: when the module is loaded and a specific textual trigger is provided, the model produces a predefined visual output; otherwise, it behaves indistinguishably from the benign model, ensuring the stealthiness of the attack. Experimental results demonstrate that MasqLoRA can be trained with minimal resource overhead and achieves a high attack success rate of 99.8%. MasqLoRA reveals a severe and unique threat in the AI supply chain, underscoring the urgent need for dedicated defense mechanisms for the LoRA-centric sharing ecosystem.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as an efficient paradigm for solving PDEs, overcoming the limitations of traditional numerical methods and significantly improving computational efficiency. However, due to the diversity and complexity of PDE systems, existing neural operators typically rely on a single network architecture, which limits their capacity to fully capture heterogeneous features and complex system dependencies. This constraint poses a bottleneck for large-scale PDE pre-training based on neural operators. To address these challenges, we propose a large-scale PDE pre-trained neural operator based on a nested Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework. In particular, the image-level MoE is designed to capture global dependencies, while the token-level Sub-MoE focuses on local dependencies. Our model can selectively activate the most suitable expert networks for a given input, thereby enhancing generalization and transferability. We conduct large-scale pre-training on twelve PDE datasets from diverse sources and successfully transfer the model to downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: 360 panoramic images are increasingly used in virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics for holistic scene understanding. However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with 3D spatial reasoning on Equirectangular Projection (ERP) images due to geometric distortion and limited 3D supervision. We introduce PanoEnv, a large-scale VQA benchmark built from synthetic 3D environments, containing 14.8K questions across five categories (e.g., relative position, volume comparison) grounded in accurate 3D annotations including depth, segmentation, and bounding boxes. Benchmarking 14 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals limited 3D understanding, achieving only 49.34% overall accuracy and 8.36% on open-ended (OE) questions. To enhance 3D reasoning, we propose a reinforcement learning post-training framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a ground-truth-guided reward that incorporates five geometry-aware strategies such as distance tolerance and spatial consistency. A two-stage curriculum further mitigates catastrophic forgetting: Stage 1 trains on structured tasks (true/false and multiple choice), and Stage 2 fine-tunes on mixed open-ended data to improve generalization. Our 7B model achieves new state-of-the-art performance, improving overall accuracy to 52.93% (+3.59%) and open-ended accuracy to 14.83% while maintaining structured-task performance. It also achieves top semantic evaluation scores (Q-Score 6.24, P-Score 5.95), surpassing 32B models. These results demonstrate that PanoEnv-QA and our curriculum-based RL framework effectively instill 3D spatial intelligence in VLMs for omnidirectional perception.

Abstract: Vision-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (VisRAG) leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to jointly retrieve relevant visual documents and generate grounded answers based on multimodal evidence. However, existing VisRAG models degrade in performance when visual inputs suffer from distortions such as blur, noise, low light, or shadow, where semantic and degradation factors become entangled within pretrained visual encoders, leading to errors in both retrieval and generation stages. To address this limitation, we introduce RobustVisRAG, a causality-guided dual-path framework that improves VisRAG robustness while preserving efficiency and zero-shot generalization. RobustVisRAG uses a non-causal path to capture degradation signals through unidirectional attention and a causal path to learn purified semantics guided by these signals. Together with the proposed Non-Causal Distortion Modeling and Causal Semantic Alignment objectives, the framework enforces a clear separation between semantics and degradations, enabling stable retrieval and generation under challenging visual conditions. To evaluate robustness under realistic conditions, we introduce the Distortion-VisRAG dataset, a large-scale benchmark containing both synthetic and real-world degraded documents across seven domains, with 12 synthetic and 5 real distortion types that comprehensively reflect practical visual degradations. Experimental results show that RobustVisRAG improves retrieval, generation, and end-to-end performance by 7.35%, 6.35%, and 12.40%, respectively, on real-world degradations, while maintaining comparable accuracy on clean inputs.

Abstract: Intrinsic image decomposition (IID) of outdoor scenes is crucial for relighting, editing, and understanding large-scale environments, but progress has been limited by the lack of real-world datasets with reliable albedo and shading supervision. We introduce Olbedo, a large-scale aerial dataset for outdoor albedo--shading decomposition in the wild. Olbedo contains 5,664 UAV images captured across four landscape types, multiple years, and diverse illumination conditions. Each view is accompanied by multi-view consistent albedo and shading maps, metric depth, surface normals, sun and sky shading components, camera poses, and, for recent flights, measured HDR sky domes. These annotations are derived from an inverse-rendering refinement pipeline over multi-view stereo reconstructions and calibrated sky illumination, together with per-pixel confidence masks. We demonstrate that Olbedo enables state-of-the-art diffusion-based IID models, originally trained on synthetic indoor data, to generalize to real outdoor imagery: fine-tuning on Olbedo significantly improves single-view outdoor albedo prediction on the MatrixCity benchmark. We further illustrate applications of Olbedo-trained models to multi-view consistent relighting of 3D assets, material editing, and scene change analysis for urban digital twins. We release the dataset, baseline models, and an evaluation protocol to support future research in outdoor intrinsic decomposition and illumination-aware aerial vision.

Abstract: Referring Multi-Object Tracking has attracted increasing attention due to its human-friendly interactive characteristics, yet it exhibits limitations in low-visibility conditions, such as nighttime, smoke, and other challenging scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new RGB-Thermal RMOT task, named RT-RMOT, which aims to fuse RGB appearance features with the illumination robustness of the thermal modality to enable all-day referring multi-object tracking. To promote research on RT-RMOT, we construct the first Referring Multi-Object Tracking dataset under RGB-Thermal modality, named RefRT. It contains 388 language descriptions, 1,250 tracked targets, and 166,147 Language-RGB-Thermal (L-RGB-T) triplets. Furthermore, we propose RTrack, a framework built upon a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that integrates RGB, thermal, and textual features. Since the initial framework still leaves room for improvement, we introduce a Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) strategy to further exploit the model's potential. To alleviate training instability during RL fine-tuning, we introduce a Clipped Advantage Scaling (CAS) strategy to suppress gradient explosion. In addition, we design Structured Output Reward and Comprehensive Detection Reward to balance exploration and exploitation, thereby improving the completeness and accuracy of target perception. Extensive experiments on the RefRT dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RTrack framework.

Abstract: Automating garment assembly from sewing patterns remains a significant challenge due to the lack of standardized annotation protocols and the frequent absence of semantic cues. Existing methods often rely on panel labels or handcrafted heuristics, which limit their applicability to real-world, non-conforming patterns. We present AutoSew, a fully automatic, geometry-based approach for predicting stitch correspondences directly from 2D pattern contours. AutoSew formulates the problem as a graph matching task, leveraging a Graph Neural Network to capture local and global geometric context, and employing a differentiable optimal transport solver to infer stitching relationships-including multi-edge connections. To support this task, we update the GarmentCodeData dataset modifying over 18k patterns with realistic multi-edge annotations, reflecting industrial assembly scenarios. AutoSew achieves 96% F1-score and successfully assembles 73.3% of test garments without error, outperforming existing methods while relying solely on geometric input. Our results demonstrate that geometry alone can robustly guide stitching prediction, enabling scalable garment assembly without manual input.

Abstract: Precise Event Spotting aims to localize fast-paced actions or events in videos with high temporal precision, a key task for applications in sports analytics, robotics, and autonomous systems. Existing methods typically process all frames uniformly, overlooking the inherent spatio-temporal redundancy in video data. This leads to redundant computation on non-informative regions while limiting overall efficiency. To remain tractable, they often spatially downsample inputs, losing fine-grained details crucial for precise localization. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{AdaSpot}, a simple yet effective framework that processes low-resolution videos to extract global task-relevant features while adaptively selecting the most informative region-of-interest in each frame for high-resolution processing. The selection is performed via an unsupervised, task-aware strategy that maintains spatio-temporal consistency across frames and avoids the training instability of learnable alternatives. This design preserves essential fine-grained visual cues with a marginal computational overhead compared to low-resolution-only baselines, while remaining far more efficient than uniform high-resolution processing. Experiments on standard PES benchmarks demonstrate that \textbf{AdaSpot} achieves state-of-the-art performance under strict evaluation metrics (\eg, $+3.96$ and $+2.26$ mAP$@0$ frames on Tennis and FineDiving), while also maintaining strong results under looser metrics.

Abstract: Ego-centric driving videos available online provide an abundant source of visual data for autonomous driving, yet their lack of annotations makes it difficult to learn representations that capture both semantic structure and 3D geometry. Recent advances in large feedforward spatial models demonstrate that point maps and ego-motion can be inferred in a single forward pass, suggesting a promising direction for scalable driving perception. We therefore propose a label-free, teacher-guided framework for learning autonomous driving representations directly from unposed videos. Unlike prior self-supervised approaches that focus primarily on frame-to-frame consistency, we posit that safe and reactive driving depends critically on temporal context. To this end, we leverage a feedforward architecture equipped with a lightweight autoregressive module, trained using multi-modal supervisory signals that guide the model to jointly predict current and future point maps, camera poses, semantic segmentation, and motion masks. Multi-modal teachers provide sequence-level pseudo-supervision, enabling LFG to learn a unified pseudo-4D representation from raw YouTube videos without poses, labels, or LiDAR. The resulting encoder not only transfers effectively to downstream autonomous driving planning on the NAVSIM benchmark, surpassing multi-camera and LiDAR baselines with only a single monocular camera, but also yields strong performance when evaluated on a range of semantic, geometric, and qualitative motion prediction tasks. These geometry and motion-aware features position LFG as a compelling video-centric foundation model for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Advances in Generative AI (GenAI) have led to the development of various protection strategies to prevent the unauthorized use of images. These methods rely on adding imperceptible protective perturbations to images to thwart misuse such as style mimicry or deepfake manipulations. Although previous attacks on these protections required specialized, purpose-built methods, we demonstrate that this is no longer necessary. We show that off-the-shelf image-to-image GenAI models can be repurposed as generic ``denoisers" using a simple text prompt, effectively removing a wide range of protective perturbations. Across 8 case studies spanning 6 diverse protection schemes, our general-purpose attack not only circumvents these defenses but also outperforms existing specialized attacks while preserving the image's utility for the adversary. Our findings reveal a critical and widespread vulnerability in the current landscape of image protection, indicating that many schemes provide a false sense of security. We stress the urgent need to develop robust defenses and establish that any future protection mechanism must be benchmarked against attacks from off-the-shelf GenAI models.

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation is hindered by the long-tailed distribution of pathologies and the open-world nature of clinical environments. Existing benchmarks often rely on closed-set classes from single institutions, failing to capture the prevalence of rare diseases or the appearance of novel findings. To address this, we present the CXR-LT 2026 challenge. This third iteration of the benchmark introduces a multi-center dataset comprising over 145,000 images from PadChest and NIH Chest X-ray datasets. The challenge defines two core tasks: (1) Robust Multi-Label Classification on 30 known classes and (2) Open-World Generalization to 6 unseen (out-of-distribution) rare disease classes. We report the results of the top-performing teams, evaluating them via mean Average Precision (mAP), AUROC, and F1-score. The winning solutions achieved an mAP of 0.5854 on Task 1 and 0.4315 on Task 2, demonstrating that large-scale vision-language pre-training significantly mitigates the performance drop typically associated with zero-shot diagnosis.

Abstract: Editable high-fidelity 4D scenes are crucial for autonomous driving, as they can be applied to end-to-end training and closed-loop simulation. However, existing reconstruction methods are primarily limited to replicating observed scenes and lack the capability for diverse weather simulation. While image-level weather editing methods tend to introduce scene artifacts and offer poor controllability over the weather effects. To address these limitations, we propose WeatherCity, a novel framework for 4D urban scene reconstruction and weather editing. Specifically, we leverage a text-guided image editing model to achieve flexible editing of image weather backgrounds. To tackle the challenge of multi-weather modeling, we introduce a novel weather Gaussian representation based on shared scene features and dedicated weather-specific decoders. This representation is further enhanced with a content consistency optimization, ensuring coherent modeling across different weather conditions. Additionally, we design a physics-driven model that simulates dynamic weather effects through particles and motion patterns. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and various scenes demonstrate that WeatherCity achieves flexible controllability, high fidelity, and temporal consistency in 4D reconstruction and weather editing. Our framework not only enables fine-grained control over weather conditions (e.g., light rain and heavy snow) but also supports object-level manipulation within the scene.

We developed \textbf{Brain3D}, a staged vision-language framework for automated radiology report generation from 3D brain tumor MRI. Our approach inflates a pretrained 2D medical encoder into a native 3D architecture and progressively aligns it with a causal language model through three stages: contrastive grounding, supervised projector warmup, and LoRA-based linguistic specialization. Unlike generalist 3D medical VLMs, \textbf{Brain3D} is tailored to neuroradiology, where hemispheric laterality, tumor infiltration patterns, and anatomical localization are critical. Evaluated on 468 subjects (BraTS pathological cases plus healthy controls), our model achieves a Clinical Pathology F1 of 0.951 versus 0.413 for a strong 2D baseline while maintaining perfect specificity on healthy scans. The staged alignment proves essential: contrastive grounding establishes visual-textual correspondence, projector warmup stabilizes conditioning, and LoRA adaptation shifts output from verbose captions to structured clinical reports\footnote{Our code is publicly available for transparency and reproducibility

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are rapidly gaining popularity, yet their outputs often lack geographical diversity, reinforce stereotypes, and misrepresent regions. Given their broad reach, it is critical to rigorously evaluate how these models portray the world. Existing diversity metrics either rely on curated datasets or focus on surface-level visual similarity, limiting interpretability. We introduce GeoDiv, a framework leveraging large language and vision-language models to assess geographical diversity along two complementary axes: the Socio-Economic Visual Index (SEVI), capturing economic and condition-related cues, and the Visual Diversity Index (VDI), measuring variation in primary entities and backgrounds. Applied to images generated by models such as Stable Diffusion and FLUX.1-dev across $10$ entities and $16$ countries, GeoDiv reveals a consistent lack of diversity and identifies fine-grained attributes where models default to biased portrayals. Strikingly, depictions of countries like India, Nigeria, and Colombia are disproportionately impoverished and worn, reflecting underlying socio-economic biases. These results highlight the need for greater geographical nuance in generative models. GeoDiv provides the first systematic, interpretable framework for measuring such biases, marking a step toward fairer and more inclusive generative systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have greatly improved visual understanding and reasoning, yet their quadratic attention and offline training protocols make them ill-suited for streaming settings where frames arrive sequentially and future observations are inaccessible. We diagnose a core limitation of current Video-LLMs, namely Time-Agnosticism, in which videos are treated as an unordered bag of evidence rather than a causally ordered sequence, yielding two failures in streams: temporal order ambiguity, in which the model cannot follow or reason over the correct chronological order, and past-current focus blindness where it fails to distinguish present observations from accumulated history. We present WeaveTime, a simple, efficient, and model agnostic framework that first teaches order and then uses order. We introduce a lightweight Temporal Reconstruction objective-our Streaming Order Perception enhancement-that instills order aware representations with minimal finetuning and no specialized streaming data. At inference, a Past-Current Dynamic Focus Cache performs uncertainty triggered, coarse-to-fine retrieval, expanding history only when needed. Plugged into exsiting Video-LLM without architectural changes, WeaveTime delivers consistent gains on representative streaming benchmarks, improving accuracy while reducing latency. These results establish WeaveTime as a practical path toward time aware stream Video-LLMs under strict online, time causal constraints. Code and weights will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Medical vision-language pretraining increasingly relies on medical reports as large-scale supervisory signals; however, raw reports often exhibit substantial stylistic heterogeneity, variable length, and a considerable amount of image-irrelevant content. Although text normalization is frequently adopted as a preprocessing step in prior work, its design principles and empirical impact on vision-language pretraining remain insufficiently and systematically examined. In this study, we present MedTri, a deployable normalization framework for medical vision-language pretraining that converts free-text reports into a unified [Anatomical Entity: Radiologic Description + Diagnosis Category] triplet. This structured, anatomy-grounded normalization preserves essential morphological and spatial information while removing stylistic noise and image-irrelevant content, providing consistent and image-grounded textual supervision at scale. Across multiple datasets spanning both X-ray and computed tomography (CT) modalities, we demonstrate that structured, anatomy-grounded text normalization is an important factor in medical vision-language pretraining quality, yielding consistent improvements over raw reports and existing normalization baselines. In addition, we illustrate how this normalization can easily support modular text-level augmentation strategies, including knowledge enrichment and anatomy-grounded counterfactual supervision, which provide complementary gains in robustness and generalization without altering the core normalization process. Together, our results position structured text normalization as a critical and generalizable preprocessing component for medical vision-language learning, while MedTri provides this normalization platform.

Some require conceptual understanding for semantic synthesis, while others rely on localization cues for spatial precision. Forcing these heterogeneous tasks to share a single representation leads to concept`-`localization representational conflict. To address this issue, we propose CoLoGen, a unified diffusion framework that progressively learns and reconciles this concept`-`localization duality. CoLoGen uses a staged curriculum that first builds core conceptual and localization abilities, then adapts them to diverse visual conditions, and finally refines their synergy for complex instruction`-`driven tasks. Central to this process is the Progressive Representation Weaving (PRW) module, which dynamically routes features to specialized experts and stably integrates their outputs across stages. Experiments on editing, controllable generation, and customized generation show that CoLoGen achieves competitive or superior performance, offering a principled representational perspective for unified image generation.

Abstract: Arbitrary-Scale SR (ASISR) remains fundamentally limited by cross-scale distribution shift: once the inference scale leaves the training range, noise, blur, and artifacts accumulate sharply. We revisit this challenge from a cross-scale distribution transition perspective and propose CASR, a simple yet highly efficient cyclic SR framework that reformulates ultra-magnification as a sequence of in-distribution scale transitions. This design ensures stable inference at arbitrary scales while requiring only a single model. CASR tackles two major bottlenecks: distribution drift across iterations and patch-wise diffusion inconsistencies. The proposed SDAM module aligns structural distributions via superpixel aggregation, preventing error accumulation, while SARM module restores high-frequency textures by enforcing autocorrelation and embedding LR self-similarity priors. Despite using only a single model, our approach significantly reduces distribution drift, preserves long-range texture consistency, and achieves superior generalization even at extreme magnification.

Abstract: In recent years, a standard computational pathology workflow has emerged where whole slide images are cropped into tiles, these tiles are processed using a foundation model, and task-specific models are built using the resulting representations. At least 15 different foundation models have been proposed, and the vast majority are trained exclusively with tiles using the 20$\times$ magnification. However, it is well known that certain histologic features can only be discerned with larger context windows and requires a pathologist to zoom in and out when analyzing a whole slide image. Furthermore, creating 224$\times$224 pixel crops at 20$\times$ leads to a large number of tiles per slide, which can be gigapixel in size. To more accurately capture multi-resolution features and investigate the possibility of reducing the number of representations per slide, we propose a region-level mixing encoder. Our approach jointly fuses image tile representations of a mixed magnification foundation model using a masked embedding modeling pretraining step. We explore a design space for pretraining the proposed mixed-magnification region aggregators and evaluate our models on transfer to biomarker prediction tasks representing various cancer types. Results demonstrate cancer dependent improvements in predictive performance, highlighting the importance of spatial context and understanding.

Abstract: Existing action-conditioned video generation models (video world models) are limited to single-agent perspectives, failing to capture the multi-agent interactions of real-world environments. We introduce Solaris, a multiplayer video world model that simulates consistent multi-view observations. To enable this, we develop a multiplayer data system designed for robust, continuous, and automated data collection on video games such as Minecraft. Unlike prior platforms built for single-player settings, our system supports coordinated multi-agent interaction and synchronized videos + actions capture. Using this system, we collect 12.64 million multiplayer frames and propose an evaluation framework for multiplayer movement, memory, grounding, building, and view consistency. We train Solaris using a staged pipeline that progressively transitions from single-player to multiplayer modeling, combining bidirectional, causal, and Self Forcing training. In the final stage, we introduce Checkpointed Self Forcing, a memory-efficient Self Forcing variant that enables a longer-horizon teacher. Results show our architecture and training design outperform existing baselines. Through open-sourcing our system and models, we hope to lay the groundwork for a new generation of multi-agent world models.

Abstract: Egocentric manipulation videos are highly challenging due to severe occlusions during interactions and frequent object entries and exits from the camera view as the person moves. Current methods typically focus on recovering either hand or object pose in isolation, but both struggle during interactions and fail to handle out-of-sight cases. Moreover, their independent predictions often lead to inconsistent hand-object relations. We introduce WHOLE, a method that holistically reconstructs hand and object motion in world space from egocentric videos given object templates. Our key insight is to learn a generative prior over hand-object motion to jointly reason about their interactions. At test time, the pretrained prior is guided to generate trajectories that conform to the video observations. This joint generative reconstruction substantially outperforms approaches that process hands and objects separately followed by post-processing. WHOLE achieves state-of-the-art performance on hand motion estimation, 6D object pose estimation, and their relative interaction reconstruction. Project website: https://judyye.github.io/whole-www

Abstract: Temporally consistent surface reconstruction of dynamic 3D objects from unstructured point cloud data remains challenging, especially for very long sequences. Existing methods either optimize deformations incrementally, risking drift and requiring long runtimes, or rely on complex learned models that demand category-specific training. We present Neu-PiG, a fast deformation optimization method based on a novel preconditioned latent-grid encoding that distributes spatial features parameterized on the position and normal direction of a keyframe surface. Our method encodes entire deformations across all time steps at various spatial scales into a multi-resolution latent grid, parameterized by the position and normal direction of a reference surface from a single keyframe. This latent representation is then augmented for time modulation and decoded into per-frame 6-DoF deformations via a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP). To achieve high-fidelity, drift-free surface reconstructions in seconds, we employ Sobolev preconditioning during gradient-based training of the latent space, completely avoiding the need for any explicit correspondences or further priors. Experiments across diverse human and animal datasets demonstrate that Neu-PiG outperforms state-the-art approaches, offering both superior accuracy and scalability to long sequences while running at least 60x faster than existing training-free methods and achieving inference speeds on the same order as heavy pretrained models.

Abstract: Natural disasters such as earthquakes, torrential rainfall, floods, and volcanic eruptions occur with extremely low frequency and affect limited geographic areas. When individuals face disaster situations, they often experience confusion and lack the domain-specific knowledge and experience necessary to determine appropriate responses and actions. While disaster information is continuously updated, even when utilizing RAG search and large language models for inquiries, obtaining relevant domain knowledge about natural disasters and experiences similar to one's specific situation is not guaranteed. When hallucinations are included in disaster question answering, artificial misinformation may spread and exacerbate confusion. This work introduces a disaster-focused question answering system based on Japanese disaster situations and response experiences. Utilizing the cl-tohoku/bert-base-japanese-v3 + Bi-LSTM + Enhanced Position Heads architecture with LoRA efficiency optimization, we achieved 70.4\% End Position accuracy with only 5.7\% of the total parameters (6.7M/117M). Experimental results demonstrate that the combination of Japanese BERT-base optimization and Bi-LSTM contextual understanding achieves accuracy levels suitable for real disaster response scenarios, attaining a 0.885 Span F1 score. Future challenges include: establishing natural disaster Q\&A benchmark datasets, fine-tuning foundation models with disaster knowledge, developing lightweight and power-efficient edge AI Disaster Q\&A applications for situations with insufficient power and communication during disasters, and addressing disaster knowledge base updates and continual learning capabilities.

Abstract: Token-level steering has emerged as a pivotal approach for inference-time alignment, enabling fine grained control over large language models by modulating their output distributions without parameter updates. While effective, existing methods rely on dense intervention at every decoding step. This persistent manipulation not only incurs substantial computational overhead but also risks compromising generation quality by excessively drifting from the model's intrinsic distribution. In this work, we show that dense intervention is unnecessary and propose Sparse Inference time Alignment (SIA), which performs sparse junction steering by intervening only at critical decision points along the generation trajectory. Our key insight is that high entropy junctions mark pivotal decision points in the generation trajectory and are particularly susceptible to misalignment, indicating the need to introduce alignment related reward signals at these points. Extensive experiments across different model families and alignment objectives show that steering only 20% to 80% of tokens achieves superior alignment-efficiency trade offs. For strong base models such as Qwen3, intervening on as few as 20% of tokens matches or even surpasses heavily post-trained instruct models. This sparsity enables stronger guidance while better preserving the model's native distribution, integrates seamlessly with search based methods such as Best-of-N, and reduces computational cost by up to 6x.

Abstract: The EQ-5D (EuroQol 5-Dimensions) is a standardized instrument for the evaluation of health-related quality of life. In health economics, systematic literature reviews (SLRs) depend on the correct identification of publications that use the EQ-5D, but manual screening of large volumes of scientific literature is time-consuming, error-prone, and inconsistent. In this study, we investigate fine-tuning of general-purpose (BERT) and domain-specific (SciBERT, BioBERT) pre-trained language models (PLMs), enriched with biomedical entity information extracted through scispaCy models for each statement, to improve EQ-5D detection from abstracts. We conduct nine experimental setups, including combining three scispaCy models with three PLMs, and evaluate their performance at both the sentence and study levels. Furthermore, we explore a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approach with attention pooling to aggregate sentence-level information into study-level predictions, where each abstract is represented as a bag of enriched sentences (by scispaCy). The findings indicate consistent improvements in F1-scores (reaching 0.82) and nearly perfect recall at the study-level, significantly exceeding classical bag-of-words baselines and recently reported PLM baselines. These results show that entity enrichment significantly improves domain adaptation and model generalization, enabling more accurate automated screening in systematic reviews.

Abstract: High-quality data is essential for modern machine learning, yet many valuable corpora are sensitive and cannot be freely shared. Synthetic data offers a practical substitute for downstream development, and large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful engines for generating it. However, existing private text generation methods are severely inefficient: they are data-intensive, computationally slow, and often require large private corpora or batch sizes to achieve usable quality. We introduce EPSVec, a differentially-private lightweight alternative that steers LLM generation using *dataset vectors*--directions in activation space that capture the distributional gap between private data and public priors. EPSVec extracts and sanitizes steering vectors just once and then performs standard decoding. This decouples the privacy budget from generation, enabling arbitrarily many synthetic samples without additional privacy cost and yielding strong fidelity even in low-data regimes. Furthermore, we enhance our method by utilizing pretrained (base) models and introducing fixed-shot prompting to boost generation diversity and fidelity. Our experiments demonstrate that EPSVec outperforms existing baselines in distributional alignment and downstream utility, particularly in low-data regimes, while significantly reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) personalization holds great promise for tailoring responses by leveraging personal context and history. However, real-world users usually possess sparse interaction histories with limited personal context, such as cold-start users in social platforms and newly registered customers in online E-commerce platforms, compromising the LLM-based personalized generation. To address this challenge, we introduce GraSPer (Graph-based Sparse Personalized Reasoning), a novel framework for enhancing personalized text generation under sparse context. GraSPer first augments user context by predicting items that the user would likely interact with in the future. With reasoning alignment, it then generates texts for these interactions to enrich the augmented context. In the end, it generates personalized outputs conditioned on both the real and synthetic histories, ensuring alignment with user style and preferences. Extensive experiments on three benchmark personalized generation datasets show that GraSPer achieves significant performance gain, substantially improving personalization in sparse user context settings.

Abstract: We present a memory system for AI agents that treats stored information as continuous fields governed by partial differential equations rather than discrete entries in a database. The approach draws from classical field theory: memories diffuse through semantic space, decay thermodynamically based on importance, and interact through field coupling in multi-agent scenarios. We evaluate the system on two established long-context benchmarks: LoCoMo (ACL 2024) with 300-turn conversations across 35 sessions, and LongMemEval (ICLR 2025) testing multi-session reasoning over 500+ turns. On LongMemEval, the field-theoretic approach achieves significant improvements: +116% F1 on multi-session reasoning (p<0.01, d= 3.06), +43.8% on temporal reasoning (p<0.001, d= 9.21), and +27.8% retrieval recall on knowledge updates (p<0.001, d= 5.00). Multi-agent experiments show near-perfect collective intelligence (>99.8%) through field coupling. Code is available at github.com/rotalabs/rotalabs-fieldmem.

Abstract: With increasing integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into areas of high-stakes human decision-making, it is important to understand the risks they introduce as advisors. To be useful advisors, LLMs must sift through large amounts of content, written with both benevolent and malicious intent, and then use this information to convince a user to take a specific action. This involves two social capacities: vigilance (the ability to determine which information to use, and which to discard) and persuasion (synthesizing the available evidence to make a convincing argument). While existing work has investigated these capacities in isolation, there has been little prior investigation of how these capacities may be linked. Here, we use a simple multi-turn puzzle-solving game, Sokoban, to study LLMs' abilities to persuade and be rationally vigilant towards other LLM agents. We find that puzzle-solving performance, persuasive capability, and vigilance are dissociable capacities in LLMs. Performing well on the game does not automatically mean a model can detect when it is being misled, even if the possibility of deception is explicitly mentioned. % as part of the prompt. However, LLMs do consistently modulate their token use, using fewer tokens to reason when advice is benevolent and more when it is malicious, even if they are still persuaded to take actions leading them to failure. To our knowledge, our work presents the first investigation of the relationship between persuasion, vigilance, and task performance in LLMs, and suggests that monitoring all three independently will be critical for future work in AI safety.

Abstract: Parameter efficient fine tuning methods like LoRA have enabled task specific adaptation of large language models, but efficiently composing multiple specialized adapters for unseen tasks remains challenging. We present a novel framework for dynamic LoRA adapter composition that leverages similarity retrieval in vector databases to enable zero-shot generalization across diverse NLP tasks. Our approach constructs a task-aware vector database by embedding training examples from 22 datasets spanning commonsense reasoning, question answering, natural language inference, and sentiment analysis. At inference time, we retrieve the most similar training examples, compute task similarity distributions via nucleus sampling, and dynamically merge relevant LoRA adapters using retrieval weighted fusion strategies. We evaluated four merging methods Linear, Concatenation, TIES, and Magnitude Prune demonstrating that our dataset centric retrieval approach often matches or exceeds the performance of individually fine-tuned task-specific adapters. Notably, Linear merging achieves 70.95% on PIQA and 77.62% on RTE, substantially outperforming single-task baselines (46% and 52%, respectively). Our framework requires no additional retriever training, operates with frozen embeddings, and enables efficient, interpretable adapter composition. These results suggest that retrieval based dynamic merging offers a promising direction for scalable, parameter-efficient multitask learning without requiring full model retraining for each new task.

Abstract: It is not only what we ask large language models (LLMs) to do that matters, but also how we prompt. Phrases like "This is urgent" or "As your supervisor" can shift model behavior without altering task content. We study this effect as pragmatic framing, contextual cues that shape directive interpretation rather than task specification. While prior work exploits such cues for prompt optimization or probes them as security vulnerabilities, pragmatic framing itself has not been treated as a measurable property of instruction following. Measuring this influence systematically remains challenging, requiring controlled isolation of framing cues. We introduce a framework with three novel components: directive-framing decomposition separating framing context from task specification; a taxonomy organizing 400 instantiations of framing into 13 strategies across 4 mechanism clusters; and priority-based measurement that quantifies influence through observable shifts in directive prioritization. Across five LLMs of different families and sizes, influence mechanisms cause consistent and structured shifts in directive prioritization, moving models from baseline impartiality toward favoring the framed directive. This work establishes pragmatic framing as a measurable and predictable factor in instruction-following systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as a pivotal technique to accelerate LLM inference by employing a lightweight draft model to generate candidate tokens that are subsequently verified by the target model in parallel. However, while this paradigm successfully increases the arithmetic intensity of memory-bound inference, it causes significant compute inefficiency: the majority of draft tokens fail verification and are discarded, resulting in waste of computation. Motivated by the goal of recollecting this wasted computation, we propose a novel system that transforms discarded drafts into reusable tokens. Our key insight is to perform auto-regressive prediction at the hidden states level and postpone the integrating token information after the hidden states generation, so the draft hidden states are not contaminated by incorrect tokens, enabling hidden state reuse. To implement such a system, first we introduce a draft model architecture based on auto-regressive hidden states, which preserves richer semantics than token-based drafters to facilitate draft repurposing. Second, we design an efficient token information injection mechanism that leverages our specialized draft model to construct high-quality draft token trees and enables resampling tokens from verification failures. Third, we eliminate the overhead hidden in our design to further maximize hardware utilization. We conducted extensive evaluations against various baselines, demonstrating up to a 3.3x speedup against standard speculative decoding.

Abstract: We investigate whether progressive data scheduling -- a curriculum learning strategy that incrementally increases training data exposure (33\%$\rightarrow$67\%$\rightarrow$100\%) -- yields consistent efficiency gains across architecturally distinct document understanding models. By evaluating BERT (text-only, 110M parameters) and LayoutLMv3 (multimodal, 126M parameters) on the FUNSD and CORD benchmarks, we establish that this schedule reduces wall-clock training time by approximately 33\%, commensurate with the reduction from 6.67 to 10.0 effective epoch-equivalents of data. To isolate curriculum effects from compute reduction, we introduce matched-compute baselines (Standard-7) that control for total gradient updates. On the FUNSD dataset, the curriculum significantly outperforms the matched-compute baseline for BERT ($Δ$F1 = +0.023, $p=0.022$, $d_z=3.83$), constituting evidence for a genuine scheduling benefit in capacity-constrained models. In contrast, no analogous benefit is observed for LayoutLMv3 ($p=0.621$), whose multimodal representations provide sufficient inductive bias. On the CORD dataset, all conditions converge to equivalent F1 scores ($\geq$0.947) irrespective of scheduling, indicating a performance ceiling. Schedule ablations comparing progressive, two-phase, reverse, and random pacing confirm that the efficiency gain derives from reduced data volume rather than ordering. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that progressive scheduling is a reliable compute-reduction strategy across model families, with curriculum-specific benefits contingent on the interaction between model capacity and task complexity.

We introduce IslamicLegalBench, the first benchmark evaluating LLMs across seven schools of Islamic jurisprudence, with 718 instances covering 13 tasks of varying complexity. Evaluation of nine state-of-the-art models reveals major limitations: the best model achieves only 68% correctness with 21% hallucination, while several models fall below 35% correctness and exceed 55% hallucination. Few-shot prompting provides minimal gains, improving only 2 of 9 models by >1%. Moderate-complexity tasks requiring exact knowledge show the highest errors, whereas high-complexity tasks display apparent competence through semantic reasoning. False premise detection indicates risky sycophancy, with 6 of 9 models accepting misleading assumptions at rates above 40%. These results highlight that prompt-based methods cannot compensate for missing foundational knowledge. IslamicLegalBench offers the first systematic framework to evaluate Islamic legal reasoning in AI, revealing critical gaps in tools increasingly relied on for spiritual guidance.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve into autonomous agents that execute long-horizon workflows, invoking a high-capability model at every step becomes economically unsustainable. While model routing is effective for single-turn queries, agentic routing is a sequential, path-dependent problem: early mistakes compound, feedback is often at the end of the episode, and deployments often demand strict per-task spending limits. We propose Budget-Aware Agentic Routing, which selects between a cheap and an expensive model at each step to optimize the cost--success frontier and to operate under strict per-task budgets. We propose Boundary-Guided Training, which leverages two boundary policies (always-small vs.\ always-large) to build a difficulty taxonomy and to anchor learning under sparse rewards. Our approach warms start with boundary-guided SFT data synthesis via stratified sampling of cost-efficient trajectories, then applies Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization (BoPO), combining boundary-relative rewards with a reference-guided advantage to avoid degenerate cheap-failure solutions. Experiment results show that our method improves the efficiency frontier, matching strong routing baselines at substantially lower cost while demonstrating generalization to strict inference-time budget constraints. Overall, our work establishes a foundational framework for agentic routing, shifting the paradigm from static model selection to dynamic, budget-aware sequential decision-making.

Abstract: As applications of large language models (LLMs) become increasingly complex, the demand for robust complex instruction following capabilities is growing accordingly. We argue that a thorough understanding of the instruction itself, especially the latent reasoning structure embedded between the lines, is crucial for improving instruction following. Therefore we target complex instructions that involve implicit reasoning, intricate logical relations, and multi-constraint dependencies. We propose ImpRIF, a method to enhance LLMs' understanding of implicit reasoning instructions, thereby improving its ability to follow complex instructions. We formalize such instructions as verifiable reasoning graphs, enabling programmatic verification and graph-driven chain-of-thought reasoning. Based on this formulation, we synthesize large-scale single- and multi-turn data, propose fine-tuning with graph reasoning, and apply reinforcement learning to explicitly train models to reason along the graph. On five complex instruction following benchmarks, our models substantially outperform their base models. These results demonstrate that enhancing implicit reasoning capabilities can significantly improve complex instruction following. This project will be open-sourced in the near future.

Current evaluation faces two primary challenges: 1) a reliance on singular metrics like Pass@1, creating a "high-score illusion" that ignores the quality, efficiency, and soundness of the reasoning process; and 2) the failure of static benchmarks to quantify crucial attributes like robustness and latent capability. To address these gaps, we introduce TRACE (Trajectory-Aware Comprehensive Evaluation), a framework that holistically assesses the entire problem-solving trajectory. To counter the "high-score illusion", we propose a Hierarchical Trajectory Utility Function that quantifies process efficiency and cognitive quality, including evidence grounding, alongside accuracy. To measure deeper attributes, TRACE introduces a Scaffolded Capability Assessment protocol, quantifying an agent's latent ability by determining the minimum guidance needed for success. Our contributions include the TRACE framework, its novel metrics, and the accompanying DeepResearch-Bench with controllable complexity. Experiments show TRACE delivers a granular ranking that uncovers critical trade-offs between agent accuracy, efficiency, and robustness entirely missed by singular metrics.

Abstract: We present SPL (Structured Prompt Language), a declarative SQL-inspired language that treats large language models as generative knowledge bases and their context windows as constrained resources. SPL provides explicit WITH BUDGET/LIMIT token management, an automatic query optimizer, EXPLAIN transparency analogous to SQL's EXPLAIN ANALYZE, and native integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and persistent memory in a single declarative framework. SPL-flow extends SPL into resilient agentic pipelines with a three-tier provider fallback strategy (Ollama -> OpenRouter -> self-healing retry) fully transparent to the .spl script. Five extensions demonstrate the paradigm's breadth: (1) Text2SPL (multilingual NL->SPL translation); (2) Mixture-of-Models (MoM) routing that dispatches each PROMPT to a domain-specialist model at runtime; (3) Logical Chunking, an intelligent strategy for documents exceeding a single context window--expressed naturally through SPL's existing CTE syntax with no new constructs, decomposing a large query into a Map-Reduce pipeline that reduces attention cost from O(N^2) to O(N^2/k) and runs identically on cloud (parallel) or local hardware (sequential); (4) SPL-flow, a declarative agentic orchestration layer with resilient three-tier provider fallback; and (5) BENCHMARK for parallel multi-model comparison with automatic winner persistence. We provide a formal EBNF grammar, two pip-installable Python packages (spl-llm, spl-flow), and comparison against Prompty, DSPy, and LMQL. SPL reduces prompt boilerplate by 65% on average, surfaces a 68x cost spread across model tiers as a pre-execution signal, and runs the identical .spl script at $0.002 on OpenRouter or at zero marginal cost on a local Ollama instance--without modification.

Abstract: We introduce \ToolMATH, a math-grounded benchmark that evaluates tool-augmented language models in realistic multi-tool environments where the output depends on calling schema-specified tools and sustaining multi-step execution. It turns math problems into a controlled, correctness-checkable benchmark with tool sets, enabling systematic evaluation of model reliability under (1) large, overlapping tool catalogs and (2) the absence of the intended capability. \ToolMATH provides actionable diagnostic evidence of failure modes in tool-augmented agents, helping identify the control mechanisms required for robustness. \ToolMATH roughly contains 8k questions and 12k tools; we provide an additional hard-set \ToolMATHHard with questions and tools. Our evaluation reveals that the key failure factor is due to the inability to reason, leading to the accumulation of intermediate results' errors and constrain later decisions. Tool-list redundancy do not simply add noise, but amplify small early deviations into irreversible execution drift. The benchmark highlights that when the intended capability is missing, distractor tools can sometimes serve as partial substitutes in solution paths, yet they can also mislead models into ungrounded tool trajectories. Finally, comparisons between tool-use protocols emphasize that improvements come less from local action selection and more from long-range plan coherence and disciplined use of observations.

Abstract: Recent advances in alignment techniques such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have improved the safety of large language models (LLMs). However, these LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that disguise harmful intent through indirect or deceptive phrasing. Using causal intervention, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from shallow alignment mechanisms that lack deep reasoning, often rejecting harmful prompts without truly understanding why they are harmful. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose enhancing alignment through reasoning-aware post-training. We construct and release a novel Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning dataset that includes both utility-oriented and safety-critical prompts with step-by-step rationales. Fine-tuning on this dataset encourages models to produce principled refusals grounded in reasoning, outperforming standard SFT baselines. Furthermore, inspired by failure patterns in CoT fine-tuning, we introduce Alignment-Weighted DPO, which targets the most problematic parts of an output by assigning different preference weights to the reasoning and final-answer segments. This produces finer-grained, targeted updates than vanilla DPO and improves robustness to diverse jailbreak strategies. Extensive experiments across multiple safety and utility benchmarks show that our method consistently improves alignment robustness while maintaining overall model utility.

Abstract: Extracting clinical information from medical transcripts in low-resource languages remains a significant challenge in healthcare natural language processing (NLP). This study evaluates a two-step pipeline combining Aya-expanse-8B as a Persian-to-English translation model with five open-source small language models (SLMs) -- Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct, and Gemma-3-1B-it -- for binary extraction of 13 clinical features from 1,221 anonymized Persian transcripts collected at a cancer palliative care call center. Using a few-shot prompting strategy without fine-tuning, models were assessed on macro-averaged F1-score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), sensitivity, and specificity to account for class imbalance. Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct achieved the highest overall performance (median macro-F1: 0.899; MCC: 0.797), while Gemma-3-1B-it showed the weakest results. Larger models (7B--8B parameters) consistently outperformed smaller counterparts in sensitivity and MCC. A bilingual analysis of Aya-expanse-8B revealed that translating Persian transcripts to English improved sensitivity, reduced missing outputs, and boosted metrics robust to class imbalance, though at the cost of slightly lower specificity and precision. Feature-level results showed reliable extraction of physiological symptoms across most models, whereas psychological complaints, administrative requests, and complex somatic features remained challenging. These findings establish a practical, privacy-preserving blueprint for deploying open-source SLMs in multilingual clinical NLP settings with limited infrastructure and annotation resources, and highlight the importance of jointly optimizing model scale and input language strategy for sensitive healthcare applications.

Abstract: Tokenization and sub-tokenization based models like word2vec, BERT and the GPTs are the state-of-the-art in natural language processing. Typically, these approaches have limitations with respect to their input representation. They fail to fully capture orthographic similarities and morphological variations, especially in highly inflected and under-resource languages. To mitigate this problem, we propose to computes word vectors directly from character strings, integrating both semantic and syntactic information. We denote this transformer-based approach Rich Character Embeddings (RCE). Furthermore, we propose a hybrid model that combines transformer and convolutional mechanisms. Both vector representations can be used as a drop-in replacement for dictionary- and subtoken-based word embeddings in existing model architectures. It has the potential to improve performance for both large context-based language models like BERT and small models like word2vec for under-resourced and morphologically rich languages. We evaluate our approach on various tasks like the SWAG, declension prediction for inflected languages, metaphor and chiasmus detection for various languages. Our experiments show that it outperforms traditional token-based approaches on limited data using OddOneOut and TopK metrics.

Through targeted adaptation, this model family achieves state-of-the-art results on Catalan- and Spanish-specific tasks, while establishing robust performance across specialized biomedical and legal domains. To bridge the gap between research and production, we incorporate Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL), enabling flexible vector sizing that significantly reduces inference and storage costs. Ultimately, the MrBERT family demonstrates that modern encoder architectures can be optimized for both localized linguistic excellence and efficient, high-stakes domain specialization. We open source the complete model family on Huggingface.

Abstract: Vector glyphs are the atomic units of digital typography, yet most learning-based pipelines still depend on carefully curated exemplar sheets and raster-to-vector postprocessing, which limits accessibility and editability. We introduce VecGlypher, a single multimodal language model that generates high-fidelity vector glyphs directly from text descriptions or image exemplars. Given a style prompt, optional reference glyph images, and a target character, VecGlypher autoregressively emits SVG path tokens, avoiding raster intermediates and producing editable, watertight outlines in one pass. A typography-aware data and training recipe makes this possible: (i) a large-scale continuation stage on 39K noisy Envato fonts to master SVG syntax and long-horizon geometry, followed by (ii) post-training on 2.5K expert-annotated Google Fonts with descriptive tags and exemplars to align language and imagery with geometry; preprocessing normalizes coordinate frames, canonicalizes paths, de-duplicates families, and quantizes coordinates for stable long-sequence decoding. On cross-family OOD evaluation, VecGlypher substantially outperforms both general-purpose LLMs and specialized vector-font baselines for text-only generation, while image-referenced generation reaches a state-of-the-art performance, with marked gains over DeepVecFont-v2 and DualVector. Ablations show that model scale and the two-stage recipe are critical and that absolute-coordinate serialization yields the best geometry. VecGlypher lowers the barrier to font creation by letting users design with words or exemplars, and provides a scalable foundation for future multimodal design tools.

Abstract: In AI, most evaluations of natural language understanding tasks are conducted in standardized dialects such as Standard American English (SAE). In this work, we investigate how accurately large language models (LLMs) represent African American Vernacular English (AAVE). We analyze three LLMs to compare their usage of AAVE to the usage of humans who natively speak AAVE. We first analyzed interviews from the Corpus of Regional African American Language and TwitterAAE to identify the typical contexts where people use AAVE grammatical features such as ain't. We then prompted the LLMs to produce text in AAVE and compared the model-generated text to human usage patterns. We find that, in many cases, there are substantial differences between AAVE usage in LLMs and humans: LLMs usually underuse and misuse grammatical features characteristic of AAVE. Furthermore, through sentiment analysis and manual inspection, we found that the models replicated stereotypes about African Americans. These results highlight the need for more diversity in training data and the incorporation of fairness methods to mitigate the perpetuation of stereotypes.

Abstract: Multilingual pretraining typically lacks explicit alignment signals, leading to suboptimal cross-lingual alignment in the representation space. In this work, we show that training standard pretrained models for cross-lingual alignment with a multi-way parallel corpus in a diverse pool of languages can substantially improve multilingual and cross-lingual representations for NLU tasks. We construct a multi-way parallel dataset using translations of English text from an off-the-shelf NMT model for a pool of six target languages and achieve strong cross-lingual alignment through contrastive learning. This leads to substantial performance gains across both seen and unseen languages for multiple tasks from the MTEB benchmark evaluated for XLM-Roberta and multilingual BERT base models. Using a multi-way parallel corpus for contrastive training yields substantial gains on bitext mining (21.3%), semantic similarity (5.3%), and classification (28.4%) compared to English-centric (En-X) bilingually parallel data, where X is sampled from a pool of multiple target languages. Furthermore, finetuning mE5 model on a small dataset with multi-way parallelism significantly improves bitext mining compared to one without, underscoring the importance of multi-way cross-lingual supervision even for models already pretrained for high-quality sentence embeddings.

Abstract: Bangla-English code-mixing is widespread across South Asian social media, yet resources for implicit meaning identification in this setting remain scarce. Existing sentiment and sarcasm models largely focus on monolingual English or high-resource languages and struggle with transliteration variation, cultural references, and intra-sentential language switching. To address this gap, we introduce MixSarc, the first publicly available Bangla-English code-mixed corpus for implicit meaning identification. The dataset contains 9,087 manually annotated sentences labeled for humor, sarcasm, offensiveness, and vulgarity. We construct the corpus through targeted social media collection, systematic filtering, and multi-annotator validation. We benchmark transformer-based models and evaluate zero-shot large language models under structured prompting. Results show strong performance on humor detection but substantial degradation on sarcasm, offense, and vulgarity due to class imbalance and pragmatic complexity. Zero-shot models achieve competitive micro-F1 scores but low exact match accuracy. Further analysis reveals that over 42\% of negative sentiment instances in an external dataset exhibit sarcastic characteristics. MixSarc provides a foundational resource for culturally aware NLP and supports more reliable multi-label modeling in code-mixed environments.

Abstract: Visual spatial reasoning (VSR) remains challenging for modern vision-language models (VLMs), despite advances in multimodal architectures. A common strategy is to inject additional information at inference time, such as explicit spatial cues, external commonsense knowledge, or chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning instructions. However, it remains unclear when such information genuinely improves reasoning and when it introduces noise. In this paper, we conduct a hypothesis-driven analysis of information injection for VSR across three representative VLMs and two public benchmarks. We examine (i) the type and number of spatial contexts, (ii) the amount and relevance of injected commonsense knowledge, and (iii) the interaction between spatial grounding and CoT prompting. Our results reveal a consistent pattern: more information does not necessarily yield better reasoning. Targeted single spatial cues outperform multi-context aggregation, excessive or weakly relevant commonsense knowledge degrades performance, and CoT prompting improves accuracy only when spatial grounding is sufficiently precise. These findings highlight the importance of selective, task-aligned information injection and provide practical guidance for designing reliable multimodal reasoning pipelines.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a prevailing paradigm for enhancing reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, relying solely on outcome supervision risks reward hacking, where models learn spurious reasoning patterns to satisfy final answer checks. While recent rubric-based approaches offer fine-grained supervision signals, they suffer from high computational costs of instance-level generation and inefficient training dynamics caused by treating all rubrics as equally learnable. In this paper, we propose Stratified Rubric-based Curriculum Learning (RuCL), a novel framework that reformulates curriculum learning by shifting the focus from data selection to reward design. RuCL generates generalized rubrics for broad applicability and stratifies them based on the model's competence. By dynamically adjusting rubric weights during training, RuCL guides the model from mastering foundational perception to tackling advanced logical reasoning. Extensive experiments on various visual reasoning benchmarks show that RuCL yields a remarkable +7.83% average improvement over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model, achieving a state-of-the-art accuracy of 60.06%.

Abstract: Effectively addressing client resistance is a sophisticated clinical skill in psychological counseling, yet practitioners often lack timely and scalable supervisory feedback to refine their approaches. Although current NLP research has examined overall counseling quality and general therapeutic skills, it fails to provide granular evaluations of high-stakes moments where clients exhibit resistance. In this work, we present a comprehensive pipeline for the multi-dimensional evaluation of human counselors' interventions specifically targeting client resistance in text-based therapy. We introduce a theory-driven framework that decomposes counselor responses into four distinct communication mechanisms. Leveraging this framework, we curate and share an expert-annotated dataset of real-world counseling excerpts, pairing counselor-client interactions with professional ratings and explanatory rationales. Using this data, we perform full-parameter instruction tuning on a Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct backbone to model fine-grained evaluative judgments of response quality and generate explanations underlying. Experimental results show that our approach can effectively distinguish the quality of different communication mechanisms (77-81% F1), substantially outperforming GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet (45-59% F1). Moreover, the model produces high-quality explanations that closely align with expert references and receive near-ceiling ratings from human experts (2.8-2.9/3.0). A controlled experiment with 43 counselors further confirms that receiving these AI-generated feedback significantly improves counselors' ability to respond effectively to client resistance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable success in enhancing translation performance by integrating multimodal information. However, existing research primarily focuses on image-guided methods, whose applicability is constrained by the scarcity of multilingual image-text pairs. The speech modality overcomes this limitation due to its natural alignment with text and the abundance of existing speech datasets, which enable scalable language coverage. In this paper, we propose a Speech-guided Machine Translation (SMT) framework that integrates speech and text as fused inputs into an MLLM to improve translation quality. To mitigate reliance on low-resource data, we introduce a Self-Evolution Mechanism. The core components of this framework include a text-to-speech model, responsible for generating synthetic speech, and an MLLM capable of classifying synthetic speech samples and iteratively optimizing itself using positive samples. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework surpasses all existing methods on the Multi30K multimodal machine translation benchmark, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, on general machine translation datasets, particularly the FLORES-200, it achieves average state-of-the-art performance in 108 translation directions. Ablation studies on CoVoST-2 confirms that differences between synthetic and authentic speech have negligible impact on translation quality. The code and models are released at https://github.com/yxduir/LLM-SRT.

Abstract: This paper presents and evaluates an optimized cascaded Nepali speech-to-English text translation (S2TT) system, focusing on mitigating structural noise introduced by Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). We first establish highly proficient ASR and NMT components: a Wav2Vec2-XLS-R-300m model achieved a state-of-the-art 2.72% CER on OpenSLR-54, and a multi-stage fine-tuned MarianMT model reached a 28.32 BLEU score on the FLORES-200 benchmark. We empirically investigate the influence of punctuation loss, demonstrating that unpunctuated ASR output significantly degrades translation quality, causing a massive 20.7% relative BLEU drop on the FLORES benchmark. To overcome this, we propose and evaluate an intermediate Punctuation Restoration Module (PRM). The final S2TT pipeline was tested across three configurations on a custom dataset. The optimal configuration, which applied the PRM directly to ASR output, achieved a 4.90 BLEU point gain over the direct ASR-to-NMT baseline (BLEU 36.38 vs. 31.48). This improvement was validated by human assessment, which confirmed the optimized pipeline's superior Adequacy (3.673) and Fluency (3.804). This work validates that targeted punctuation restoration is the most effective intervention for mitigating structural noise in the Nepali S2TT pipeline. It establishes an optimized baseline and demonstrates a critical architectural insight for developing cascaded speech translation systems for similar low-resource languages.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated capabilities in text generation, while their increasing parameter scales present challenges in computational and memory efficiency. Post-training sparsity (PTS), which reduces model cost by removing weights from dense networks, is an effective approach. However, native dense matrices lack high sparsity, making existing approaches that directly remove weights disrupt model states, resulting in unsatisfactory performance recovery even with post-tuning. We propose Sparsity Induction, which promotes models toward higher sparsity at both distribution and feature levels before pruning, to push the limits of PTS. At the distribution level, we enhance distributional sparsity through mathematically equivalent scaling transformations, which are fully absorbable and incur no extra parameters or inference-time overhead. At the feature level, we introduce Spectral Norm Loss to promote feature sparsity from a low-rank perspective. Experiments across diverse model architectures and tasks demonstrate that our method further enhances sparsity-friendliness, achieving superior pruning performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as a crucial technique for compressing Large Language Models (LLMs). Although existing cross-tokenizer KD methods have made notable progress, their effectiveness remains constrained by suboptimal alignment across sequence and vocabulary levels. To address these limitations, we introduce Dual-Space Weighting and Time-Warped Alignment (DWA-KD), a novel cross-tokenizer distillation framework that enhances token-wise distillation through dual-space entropy-based weighting and achieves precise sequence-level alignment by leveraging both lexical and semantic information. At the token level, DWA-KD maps teacher representations into the student space and vice versa, performing dual-space KD via Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL). The process is modulated by dual-space weights that up-weight tokens where the student is uncertain and the teacher is confident, thereby focusing learning on informative tokens rather than treating all positions equally. At the sequence level, DWA-KD applies Soft Dynamic Time Warping (Soft-DTW) to both the embedding and final hidden-state layers, enabling robust alignment of lexical and contextual semantics between teacher and student sequences. Extensive experiments across diverse NLP benchmarks demonstrate that DWA-KD outperforms state-of-the-art KD baselines, while ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of entropy-based token weighting and embedding and final hidden state layer Soft-DTW alignment.

Abstract: Human recursive numeral systems (i.e., counting systems such as English base-10 numerals), like many other grammatical systems, are highly regular. Following prior work that relates cross-linguistic tendencies to biases in learning, we ask whether regular systems are common because regularity facilitates learning. Adopting methods from the Reinforcement Learning literature, we confirm that highly regular human(-like) systems are easier to learn than unattested but possible irregular systems. This asymmetry emerges under the natural assumption that recursive numeral systems are designed for generalisation from limited data to represent all integers exactly. We also find that the influence of regularity on learnability is absent for unnatural, highly irregular systems, whose learnability is influenced instead by signal length, suggesting that different pressures may influence learnability differently in different parts of the space of possible numeral systems. Our results contribute to the body of work linking learnability to cross-linguistic prevalence.

Abstract: The reasoning process of Large Language Models (LLMs) is often plagued by hallucinations and missing facts in question-answering tasks. A promising solution is to ground LLMs' answers in verifiable knowledge sources, such as Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Prevailing KG-enhanced methods typically constrained LLM reasoning either by enforcing rules during generation or by imitating paths from a fixed set of demonstrations. However, they naturally confined the reasoning patterns of LLMs within the scope of prior experience or fine-tuning data, limiting their generalizability to out-of-distribution graph reasoning problems. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose Explore-on-Graph (EoG), a novel framework that encourages LLMs to autonomously explore a more diverse reasoning space on KGs. To incentivize exploration and discovery of novel reasoning paths, we propose to introduce reinforcement learning during training, whose reward is the correctness of the reasoning paths' final answers. To enhance the efficiency and meaningfulness of the exploration, we propose to incorporate path information as additional reward signals to refine the exploration process and reduce futile efforts. Extensive experiments on five KGQA benchmark datasets demonstrate that, to the best of our knowledge, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming not only open-source but also even closed-source LLMs.

Abstract: We describe our end-to-end system for Bengali long-form speech recognition (ASR) and speaker diarization submitted to the DL Sprint 4.0 competition on Kaggle. Bengali presents substantial challenges for both tasks: a large phoneme inventory, significant dialectal variation, frequent code-mixing with English, and a relative scarcity of large-scale labelled corpora. For ASR we achieve a best private Word Error Rate (WER) of 0.37738 and public WER of 0.36137, combining a BengaliAI fine-tuned Whisper medium model with Demucs source separation for vocal isolation, silence-boundary chunking, and carefully tuned generation hyperparameters. For speaker diarization we reach a best private Diarization Error Rate (DER) of 0.27671 and public DER of 0.20936 by replacing the default segmentation model inside the pyannote.audio pipeline with a Bengali-fine-tuned variant, pairing it with wespeaker-voxceleb-resnet34-LM embeddings and centroid-based agglomerative clustering. Our experiments demonstrate that domain-specific fine-tuning of the segmentation component, vocal source separation, and natural silence-aware chunking are the three most impactful design choices for low-resource Bengali speech processing.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition (IDRR) remains a challenging task due to the requirement for deep semantic understanding in the absence of explicit discourse markers. A further limitation is that existing methods only predict relations without providing any supporting explanations. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities in both deep language understanding and natural language explanation generation. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach to distill the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into lightweight IDRR models to improve both performance and interpretability. Specifically, we first prompt an LLM to generate explanations for each training instance conditioned on its gold label. Then, we introduce a novel classification-generation framework that jointly performs relation prediction and explanation generation, and train it with the additional supervision of LLM-generated explanations. Our framework is plug-and-play, enabling easy integration with most existing IDRR models. Experimental results on PDTB demonstrate that our approach significantly improves IDRR performance, while human evaluation further confirms that the generated explanations enhance model interpretability. Furthermore, we validate the generality of our approach on sentiment classification and natural language inference

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) distillation from Large Language Models (LLMs) often induces "overthinking" in Small Language Models (SLMs), leading to performance degradation and excessive token consumption. In this study, we propose Disciplined Chain-of-Thought (D-CoT), a novel framework that enforces a structured reasoning process using control tags -- such as <TEMP_LOW> for fact-checking and <TEMP_HIGH> for multi-perspective exploration -- as auxiliary scaffolding during training. By optimizing the CoT trajectory, D-CoT suppresses reasoning drift and simultaneously achieves token reduction and performance improvement. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on Qwen3-8B: with only 5,000 training samples, D-CoT significantly boosts accuracy on GPQA-diamond by 9.9% and MMLU-Pro (0-shot) by 9.1%, while drastically reducing computational costs. Furthermore, we confirm that the model internalizes this disciplined thought structure, maintaining high performance even without explicit control tags during inference.

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advance in handling interleaved image-text data, assessing their few-shot learning capabilities remains an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce FewMMBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs under few-shot conditions, with a focus on In-Context Learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. Covering a diverse suite of multimodal understanding tasks, from attribute recognition to temporal reasoning, FewMMBench enables systematic analysis across task types, model families, and prompting strategies. We evaluate 26 open-weight MLLMs from six model families across zero-shot, few-shot, and CoT-augmented few-shot settings. Our findings reveal that instruction-tuned models exhibit strong zero-shot performance but benefit minimally, or even regress, with additional demonstrations or CoT reasoning. Retrieval-based demonstrations and increased context size also yield limited gains. These results highlight FewMMBench as a rigorous testbed for diagnosing and advancing few-shot capabilities in multimodal LLMs. The data is available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/mustafaa/FewMMBench

Abstract: Since individuals may struggle to recall all life details and often confuse events, establishing a system to assist users in recalling forgotten experiences is essential. While numerous studies have proposed memory recall systems, these primarily rely on deep learning techniques that require extensive training and often face data scarcity due to the limited availability of personal lifelogs. As lifelogs grow over time, systems must also adapt quickly to newly accumulated data. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, making them promising for personalized applications. In this work, we present a framework that leverages LLMs for proactive information access, integrating personal knowledge graphs to enhance the detection of access needs through a refined decision-making process. Our framework offers high flexibility, enabling the replacement of base models and the modification of fact retrieval methods for continuous improvement. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively identifies forgotten events, supporting users in recalling past experiences more efficiently.

Abstract: Current large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown strong ability on challenging tasks after reinforcement learning (RL) based post-training. However, previous work mainly focuses on English reasoning in expectation of the strongest performance, despite the demonstrated potential advantage of multilingual thinking, as well as the requirement for native thinking traces by global users. In this paper, we propose ExpLang, a novel LLM post-training pipeline that enables on-policy thinking language selection to improve exploration and exploitation during RL with the use of multiple languages. The results show that our method steadily outperforms English-only training with the same training budget, while showing high thinking language compliance for both seen and unseen languages. Analysis shows that, by enabling on-policy thinking language selection as an action during RL, ExpLang effectively extends the RL exploration space with diversified language preference and improves the RL exploitation outcome with leveraged non-English advantage. The method is orthogonal to most RL algorithms and opens up a new perspective on using multilinguality to improve LRMs.

Abstract: Sarcasm detection in multilingual and code-mixed environments remains a challenging task for natural language processing models due to structural variations, informal expressions, and low-resource linguistic availability. This study compares four large language models, Llama 3.1, Mistral, Gemma 3, and Phi-4, with a fine-tuned DistilBERT model for sarcasm detection in code-mixed Hinglish text. The results indicate that the smaller, sequentially fine-tuned DistilBERT model achieved the highest overall accuracy of 84%, outperforming all of the LLMs in zero and few-shot set ups, using minimal LLM generated code-mixed data used for fine-tuning. These findings indicate that domain-adaptive fine-tuning of smaller transformer based models may significantly improve sarcasm detection over general LLM inference, in low-resource and data scarce settings.

Abstract: Multimodal Role-Playing Agents (MRPAs) are attracting increasing attention due to their ability to deliver more immersive multimodal emotional interactions. However, existing studies still rely on pure textual benchmarks to evaluate the text responses of MRPAs, while delegating the assessment of their multimodal expressions solely to modality-synthesis metrics. This evaluation paradigm, on the one hand, entangles semantic assessment with modality generation, leading to ambiguous error attribution, and on the other hand remains constrained by the heavy reliance on human judgment. To this end, we propose MERRY, a semantically decoupled evaluation framework for assessing Multimodal Emotional and Role consistencies of Role-playing agents. This framework introduce five refined metrics for EC and three for RC. Notably, we transform the traditional subjective scoring approach into a novel bidirectional-evidence-finding task, significantly improving the human agreement of LLM-as-Judge evaluations. Based on MERRY, we conduct extensive evaluations. Our empirical results primarily reveal that: (1) Training on synthetic datasets tends to reduce emotional consistency, whereas training on real-world datasets improves it; (2) Existing models suffer from emotional templatization and simplification, exhibiting positive-bias and performance bottleneck in fine-grained negative emotions; (3) Simple prompting method strengthens the weak models but constrains the strong ones, while simple fine-tuning method suffers from poor role generalization. Codes and dataset are available.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable breadth of knowledge, yet their ability to reason about computational processes remains poorly understood. Closing this gap matters for practitioners who rely on LLMs to guide algorithm selection and deployment. We address this limitation using causal discovery as a testbed and evaluate eight frontier LLMs against ground truth derived from large-scale algorithm executions and find systematic, near-total failure. Models produce ranges far wider than true confidence intervals yet still fail to contain the true algorithmic mean in the majority of instances; most perform worse than random guessing and the marginal above-random performance of the best model is most consistent with benchmark memorization rather than principled reasoning. We term this failure algorithmic blindness and argue it reflects a fundamental gap between declarative knowledge about algorithms and calibrated procedural prediction.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown great potential in medical applications, yet existing benchmarks inadequately capture real-world clinical complexity. We introduce MEDSYN, a multilingual, multimodal benchmark of highly complex clinical cases with up to 7 distinct visual clinical evidence (CE) types per case. Mirroring clinical workflow, we evaluate 18 MLLMs on differential diagnosis (DDx) generation and final diagnosis (FDx) selection. While top models often match or even outperform human experts on DDx generation, all MLLMs exhibit a much larger DDx--FDx performance gap compared to expert clinicians, indicating a failure mode in synthesis of heterogeneous CE types. Ablations attribute this failure to (i) overreliance on less discriminative textual CE ($\it{e.g.}$, medical history) and (ii) a cross-modal CE utilization gap. We introduce Evidence Sensitivity to quantify the latter and show that a smaller gap correlates with higher diagnostic accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate how it can be used to guide interventions to improve model performance. We will open-source our benchmark and code.

Abstract: Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) infers missing facts, with recent advances increasingly harnessing the semantic priors and reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevailing generative paradigms are prone to memorizing surface-level co-occurrences rather than learning genuine relational semantics, limiting out-of-distribution generalization. To address this, we propose RADAR, which reformulates KGR from generative pattern matching to discriminative relational reasoning. We recast KGR as discriminative entity selection, where reinforcement learning enforces relative entity separability beyond token-likelihood imitation. Leveraging this separability, inference operates directly in representation space, ensuring consistency with the discriminative optimization and bypassing generation-induced hallucinations. Across four benchmarks, RADAR achieves 5-6% relative gains on link prediction and triple classification over strong LLM baselines, while increasing task-relevant mutual information in intermediate representations by 62.9%, indicating more robust and transferable relational reasoning.

Abstract: Recent work has examined language models from a linguistic perspective to better understand how they acquire language. Most existing benchmarks focus on judging grammatical acceptability, whereas the ability to interpret meanings conveyed by grammatical forms has received much less attention. We introduce the Linguistic Minimal-Pair Benchmark for Evaluating Constructional Understanding in Language Models (CxMP), a benchmark grounded in Construction Grammar that treats form-meaning pairings, or constructions, as fundamental linguistic units. CxMP evaluates whether models can interpret the semantic relations implied by constructions, using a controlled minimal-pair design across nine construction types, including the let-alone, caused motion, and ditransitive constructions. Our results show that while syntactic competence emerges early, constructional understanding develops more gradually and remains limited even in large language models (LLMs). CxMP thus reveals persistent gaps in how language models integrate form and meaning, providing a framework for studying constructional understanding and learning trajectories in language models.

Abstract: Diversity has been gaining interest in the NLP community in recent years. At the same time, state-of-the-art transformer models such as ModernBERT use very large pre-training datasets, which are driven by size rather than by diversity. This summons for an investigation of the impact of diversity on the ModernBERT pre-training. We do so in this study, with the express intent of reducing pre-training dataset size, while retaining at least comparable performance. We compare diversity-driven sampling algorithms, so as to pick the best one. We find that diversity-driven sampling allows in some tasks to gain 10 points relative to randomly-sampled pre-training data of commensurate size. We also see that a model pre-trained for 483h on a diversity-driven dataset of 150M tokens can yield a commensurate performance to a model pre-trained for 1,775h on a randomly-driven dataset of 2.4B tokens.

Existing Natural Language Processing (NLP) resources for DLT focus narrowly on cryptocurrencies price prediction and smart contracts, leaving domain-specific language under explored despite the sector's ~$3 trillion market capitalization and rapid technological evolution.
  We demonstrate DLT-Corpus' utility by analyzing technology emergence patterns and market-innovation correlations. Findings reveal that technologies originate in scientific literature before reaching patents and social media, following traditional technology transfer patterns. While social media sentiment remains overwhelmingly bullish even during crypto winters, scientific and patent activity grow independently of market fluctuations, tracking overall market expansion in a virtuous cycle where research precedes and enables economic growth that funds further innovation.
  We publicly release the full DLT-Corpus; LedgerBERT, a domain-adapted model achieving 23% improvement over BERT-base on a DLT-specific Named Entity Recognition (NER) task; and all associated tools and code.

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) refers to an agent's ability to model the internal states of others. Contributing to the debate whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit genuine ToM capabilities, our study investigates their ToM robustness using perturbations on false-belief tasks and examines the potential of Chain-of-Thought prompting (CoT) to enhance performance and explain the LLM's decision. We introduce a handcrafted, richly annotated ToM dataset, including classic and perturbed false belief tasks, the corresponding spaces of valid reasoning chains for correct task completion, subsequent reasoning faithfulness, task solutions, and propose metrics to evaluate reasoning chain correctness and to what extent final answers are faithful to reasoning traces of the generated CoT. We show a steep drop in ToM capabilities under task perturbation for all evaluated LLMs, questioning the notion of any robust form of ToM being present. While CoT prompting improves the ToM performance overall in a faithful manner, it surprisingly degrades accuracy for some perturbation classes, indicating that selective application is necessary.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized inference across diverse natural language tasks, with larger models performing better but at higher computational costs. We propose a confidence-driven strategy that dynamically selects the most suitable model based on confidence estimates. By assessing a model's confidence in handling the task and response accuracy, tasks that are likely to be solved correctly are retained, while more uncertain or complex cases are delegated to a larger model, ensuring reliability while minimizing computation. Specifically, we evaluate a model's likelihood of knowing the correct answer and the probability that its response is accurate. Experiments on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark show that our approach achieves accuracy comparable to the largest model while reducing computational costs by 20\% to 40\%. When applied to GPT-4o API calls, it reduces token usage by approximately 60\%, further improving cost efficiency. These findings indicate the potential of confidence-based model selection to enhance real-world LLM deployment, particularly in resource-constrained settings such as edge devices and commercial API applications.

Abstract: Instruction-following benchmarks remain predominantly English-centric, leaving a critical evaluation gap for the hundreds of millions of Indic language speakers. We introduce IndicIFEval, a benchmark evaluating constrained generation of LLMs across 14 Indic languages using automatically verifiable, rule-based instructions. It comprises around 800 human-verified examples per language spread across two complementary subsets: IndicIFEval-Ground, translated prompts from IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023) carefully localized for Indic contexts, and IndicIFEval-Ground, synthetically generated instructions grounded in native Indic content. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of major open-weight and proprietary models spanning both reasoning and non-reasoning models. While models maintain strong adherence to formatting constraints, they struggle significantly with lexical and cross-lingual tasks -- and despite progress in high-resource languages, instruction-following across the broader Indic family lags significantly behind English. We release IndicIFEval and its evaluation scripts to support progress on multilingual constrained generation (http://github.com/ai4bharat/IndicIFEval).

Abstract: The inability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to modulate their personality expression in response to evolving dialogue dynamics hinders their performance in complex, interactive contexts. We propose a model-agnostic framework for dynamic personality simulation that employs state machines to represent latent personality states, where transition probabilities are dynamically adapted to the conversational context. Part of our architecture is a modular pipeline for continuous personality scoring that evaluates dialogues along latent axes while remaining agnostic to the specific personality models, their dimensions, transition mechanisms, or LLMs used. These scores function as dynamic state variables that systematically reconfigure the system prompt, steering behavioral alignment throughout the interaction.We evaluate this framework by operationalizing the Interpersonal Circumplex (IPC) in a medical education setting. Results demonstrate that the system successfully adapts its personality state to user inputs, but also influences user behavior, thereby facilitating de-escalation training. Notably, the scoring pipeline maintains comparable precision even when utilizing lightweight, fine-tuned classifiers instead of large-scale LLMs. This work demonstrates the feasibility of modular, personality-adaptive architectures for education, customer support, and broader human-computer interaction.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over long contexts is a crucial capability for language models (LMs). Although recent models support increasingly long context windows, their accuracy often deteriorates as input length grows. In practice, models often struggle to keep attention aligned with the most relevant context throughout decoding. In this work, we propose DySCO, a novel decoding algorithm for improving long-context reasoning. DySCO leverages retrieval heads--a subset of attention heads specialized for long-context retrieval--to identify task-relevant tokens at each decoding step and explicitly up-weight them. By doing so, DySCO dynamically adjusts attention during generation to better utilize relevant context. The method is training-free and can be applied directly to any off-the-shelf LMs. Across multiple instruction-tuned and reasoning models, DySCO consistently improves performance on challenging long-context reasoning benchmarks, yielding relative gains of up to 25% on MRCR and LongBenchV2 at 128K context length with modest additional compute. Further analysis highlights the importance of both dynamic attention rescaling and retrieval-head-guided selection for the effectiveness of the method, while providing interpretability insights into decoding-time attention behavior. Our code is available at https://github.com/princeton-pli/DySCO.

Abstract: Over the last twenty years, significant progress has been made in designing and implementing Question Answering (QA) systems. However, addressing complex questions, the answers to which are spread across multiple documents, remains a challenging problem. Recent QA systems that are designed to handle complex questions work either on the basis of knowledge graphs, or utilise contem- porary neural models that are expensive to train, in terms of both computational resources and the volume of training data required. In this paper, we present LiCQA, an unsupervised question answer- ing model that works primarily on the basis of corpus evidence. We empirically compare the effectiveness and efficiency of LiCQA with two recently presented QA systems, which are based on different underlying principles. The results of our experiments show that LiCQA significantly outperforms these two state-of-the-art systems on benchmark data with noteworthy reduction in latency.

Abstract: We study reasoning for accessing world knowledge stored in a language model's parameters. For example, recalling that Canberra is Australia's capital may benefit from thinking through major cities and the concept of purpose-built capitals. While reasoning language models are trained via reinforcement learning to produce reasoning traces on tasks such as mathematics, they may not reason well for accessing their own world knowledge. We first find that models do not generate their best world knowledge reasoning by default: adding a simple "think step-by-step" cue demonstrates statistically significant improvement in knowledge recall but not math. Motivated by this, we propose training models to reason over their parametric knowledge using world-knowledge question answering as a verifiable reward. After reinforcement learning on TriviaQA (+9.9%), performance also improves on Natural Questions, HotpotQA, SimpleQA, and StrategyQA by 4.2%, 2.1%, 0.6%, and 3.0%, respectively. Reasoning models are under-optimized for parametric knowledge access, but can be easily trained to reason better.

Abstract: Sumerian transliteration is a conventional system for representing a scholar's interpretation of a tablet in the Latin script. Thanks to visionary digital Assyriology projects such as ETCSL, CDLI, and Oracc, a large number of Sumerian transliterations have been published online, and these data are well-structured for a variety of search and analysis tasks. However, the absence of a comprehensive, accessible dataset pairing transliterations with a digital representation of the tablet's cuneiform glyphs has prevented the application of modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to the task of Sumerian transliteration.
  To address this gap, we present SumTablets, a dataset pairing Unicode representations of 91,606 Sumerian cuneiform tablets (totaling 6,970,407 glyphs) with the associated transliterations published by Oracc. We construct SumTablets by first preprocessing and standardizing the Oracc transliterations before mapping each reading back to the Unicode representation of the source glyph. Further, we retain parallel structural information (e.g., surfaces, newlines, broken segments) through the use of special tokens. We release SumTablets as a Hugging Face Dataset (CC BY 4.0) and open source data preparation code via GitHub.
  Additionally, we leverage SumTablets to implement and evaluate two transliteration baselines: (1) weighted sampling from a glyph's possible readings, and (2) fine-tuning an autoregressive language model. Our fine-tuned language model achieves an average transliteration character-level F-score (chrF) of 97.55, demonstrating the immediate potential of transformer-based transliteration models in allowing experts to rapidly verify generated transliterations rather than manually transliterating tablets one-by-one.

Abstract: The reliability of multilingual Large Language Model (LLM) evaluation is currently compromised by the inconsistent quality of translated benchmarks. Existing resources often suffer from semantic drift and context loss, which can lead to misleading performance metrics. In this work, we present a fully automated framework designed to address these challenges by enabling scalable, high-quality translation of datasets and benchmarks. We demonstrate that adapting test-time compute scaling strategies, specifically Universal Self-Improvement (USI) and our proposed multi-round ranking method, T-RANK, allows for significantly higher quality outputs compared to traditional pipelines. Our framework ensures that benchmarks preserve their original task structure and linguistic nuances during localization. We apply this approach to translate popular benchmarks and datasets into eight Eastern and Southern European languages (Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Slovak, Romanian, Lithuanian, Estonian, Turkish, Greek). Evaluations using both reference-based metrics and LLM-as-a-judge show that our translations surpass existing resources, resulting in more accurate downstream model assessment. We release both the framework and the improved benchmarks to facilitate robust and reproducible multilingual AI development.

Abstract: This work considers a number of optimization problems and reductive relations between them. The two main problems we are interested in are the \emph{Optimal Decision Tree} and \emph{Set Cover}. We study these two fundamental tasks under precedence constraints, that is, if a test (or set) $X$ is a predecessor of $Y$, then in any feasible decision tree $X$ needs to be an ancestor of $Y$ (or respectively, if $Y$ is added to set cover, then so must be $X$). For the Optimal Decision Tree we consider two optimization criteria: worst case identification time (height of the tree) or the average identification time. Similarly, for the Set Cover we study two cost measures: the size of the cover or the average cover time.
  Our approach is to develop a number of algorithmic reductions, where an approximation algorithm for one problem provides an approximation for another via a black-box usage of a procedure for the former. En route we introduce other optimization problems either to complete the `reduction landscape' or because they hold the essence of combinatorial structure of our problems. The latter is brought by a problem of finding a maximum density precedence closed subfamily, where the density is defined as the ratio of the number of items the family covers to its size. By doing so we provide $\cO^*(\sqrt{m})$-approximation algorithms for all of the aforementioned problems. The picture is complemented by a number of hardness reductions that provide $o(m^{1/12-ε})$-inapproximability results for the decision tree and covering problems. Besides giving a complete set of results for general precedence constraints, we also provide polylogarithmic approximation guarantees for two most typically studied and applicable precedence types, outforests and inforests. By providing corresponding hardness results, we show these results to be tight.

Abstract: The Cai--Fürer--Immerman (CFI) construction provides the canonical family of hard instances for the Weisfeiler--Leman (WL) hierarchy: distinguishing the two non-isomorphic CFI graphs over a base graph $G$ requires $k$-WL where $k$ meets or exceeds the treewidth of $G$. In this paper, we introduce $Δ^\ell$-DRESS, which applies $\ell$ levels of iterated node deletion to the DRESS continuous structural refinement framework. $Δ^\ell$-DRESS runs Original-DRESS on all $\binom{n}{\ell}$ subgraphs obtained by removing $\ell$ nodes, and compares the resulting histograms. We show empirically on the canonical CFI benchmark family that Original-DRESS ($Δ^0$) already distinguishes $\text{CFI}(K_3)$ (requiring 2-WL), and that each additional deletion level extends the range by one WL level: $Δ^1$ reaches 3-WL, $Δ^2$ reaches 4-WL, and $Δ^3$ reaches 5-WL, distinguishing CFI pairs over $K_n$ for $n = 3, \ldots, 6$. Crucially, $Δ^3$ fails on $\text{CFI}(K_7)$ (requiring 6-WL), confirming a sharp boundary at $(\ell+2)$-WL. The computational cost is $\mathcal{O}\bigl(\binom{n}{\ell} \cdot I \cdot m \cdot d_{\max}\bigr)$ -- polynomial in $n$ for fixed $\ell$. These results establish $Δ^\ell$-DRESS as a practical framework for systematically climbing the WL hierarchy on the canonical CFI benchmark family.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The maximal biclique enumeration problem in bipartite graphs is fundamental and has numerous applications in E-commerce and transaction networks. Most existing studies adopt a branch-and-bound framework, which recursively expands a partial biclique with a vertex until no further vertices can be added. Equipped with a basic pivot selection strategy, all state-of-the-art methods have a worst-case time complexity no better than $O(m\cdot (\sqrt{2})^n)$}, where $m$ and $n$ are the number of edges and vertices in the graph, respectively. In this paper, we introduce a new branch-and-bound (BB) algorithm \texttt{IPS}. In \texttt{IPS}, we relax the strict stopping criterion of existing methods by allowing termination when all maximal bicliques within the current branch can be outputted in the time proportional to the number of maximal bicliques inside, reducing the total number of branches required. Second, to fully unleash the power of the new termination condition, we propose an improved pivot selection strategy, which well aligns with the new termination condition to achieve better theoretical and practical performance. Formally, \texttt{IPS} improves the worst-case time complexity to $O(m\cdot α^n + n\cdot β)$, where $α(\approx 1.3954)$ is the largest positive root of $x^4-2x-1=0$ and $β$ represents the number of maximal bicliques in the graph, respectively. This result surpasses that of all existing algorithms given that $α$ is strictly smaller than $\sqrt{2}$ and $β$ is at most $(\sqrt{2})^n-2$ theoretically. Furthermore, we apply an inclusion-exclusion-based framework to boost the performance of \texttt{IPS}, improving the worst-case time complexity to $O(n\cdot γ^2\cdotα^γ+ γ\cdot β)$ for large sparse graphs ($γ$ is a parameter satisfying $γ\ll n$ for sparse graphs).

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the problem of preemptively scheduling jobs online over time on a single machine to minimize the total flow time.
  In the traditional clairvoyant scheduling model, the scheduler learns about the processing time of a job at its arrival, and scheduling at any time the job with the shortest remaining processing time (SRPT) is optimal. In contrast, the practically relevant non-clairvoyant model assumes that the processing time of a job is unknown at its arrival, and is only revealed when it completes. Non-clairvoyant flow time minimization does not admit algorithms with a constant competitive ratio. Consequently, the problem has been studied under speed augmentation (JACM'00) or with predicted processing times (STOC'21, SODA'22) to attain constant guarantees.
  In this paper, we consider $α$-clairvoyant scheduling, where the scheduler learns the processing time of a job once it completes an $α$-fraction of its processing time. This naturally interpolates between clairvoyant scheduling ($α=0$) and non-clairvoyant scheduling ($α=1$). By elegantly fusing two traditional algorithms, we propose a scheduling rule with a competitive ratio of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{1-α})$ whenever $0 \leq α< 1$. As $α$ increases, our competitive guarantee transitions nicely (up to constants) between the previously established bounds for clairvoyant and non-clairvoyant flow time minimization. We complement this positive result with a tight randomized lower bound.

Abstract: The $L_2$-norm, or collision norm, is a core entity in the analysis of distributions and probabilistic algorithms. Batu and Canonne (FOCS 2017) presented an extensive analysis of algorithmic aspects of the $L_2$-norm and its connection to uniformity testing. However, when it comes to estimating the $L_2$-norm itself, their algorithm is not always optimal compared to the instance-specific second-moment bounds, $O(1/(\varepsilon\|μ\|_2) + (\|μ\|_3^3 - \|μ\|_2^4) / (\varepsilon^2 \|μ\|_2^4))$, as stated by Batu (WoLA 2025, open problem session).
  In this paper, we present an unbiased $L_2$-estimation algorithm whose sample complexity matches the instance-specific second-moment analysis. Additionally, we show that $Ω(1/(\varepsilon \|μ\|_2))$ is indeed a per-instance lower bound for estimating the norm of a distribution $μ$ by sampling (even for non-unbiased estimators).

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In the One-Fast-Many-Slow decision problem, introduced by Sheffield and Westover (ITCS '25), a scheduler, with access to one fast machine and infinitely many slow machines, receives a series of tasks and must allocate the work among its machines. The goal is to minimize the overhead of an online algorithm over the optimal offline algorithm. Three versions of this setting were considered: Instantly-committing schedulers that must assign tasks to machines immediately and irrevocably, Eventually-committing schedulers whose assignments are irrevocable but can occur anytime after a task arrives, and Never-committing schedulers that can interrupt and restart a task on a different machine. In the Instantly-committing model, Sheffield and Westover showed that the optimal competitive ratio is equal to 2, while in the Eventually-committing model the competitive ratio lies in the interval [1.618, 1.678], and in the Never-committing model the competitive ratio lies in the interval [1.366, 1.5] (SPAA '24, ITCS '25). In the latter two models, the exact optimal competitive ratios were left as open problems, moreover Kuszmaul and Westover (SPAA '24) conjectured that the lower bound in the Eventually-committing model is tight.
  In this paper we resolve this problem by providing tight bounds for the competitive ratios in the Eventually-committing and Never-committing models. For Eventually-committing, we prove Kuszmaul and Westover's conjecture by giving an algorithm achieving a competitive ratio equal to the lower bound of $\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\approx 1.618$. For Never-committing, we provide an explicit Task Arrival Process (TAP) lower bounding the competitive ratio to the previous upper bound of 1.5.

Abstract: We consider the robust permutation flowshop problem under the budgeted uncertainty model, where at most a given number of job processing times may deviate on each machine. We show that solutions for this problem can be determined by solving polynomially many instances of the corresponding nominal problem. As a direct consequence, our result implies that this robust flowshop problem can be solved in polynomial time for two machines, and can be approximated in polynomial time for any fixed number of machines. The reduction that is our main result follows from an analysis similar to Bertsimas and Sim (2003) except that dualization is applied to the terms of a min-max objective rather than to a linear objective function. Our result may be surprising considering that heuristic and exact integer programming based methods have been developed in the literature for solving the two-machine flowshop problem. We conclude by showing a logarithmic factor improvement in the overall running time implied by a naive reduction to nominal problems in the case of two machines and three machines.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We establish a general equilibrium theory for systems of large language model (LLM) agents operating under centralized orchestration. The framework is a production economy in the sense of Arrow-Debreu (1954), extended to infinite-dimensional commodity spaces following Bewley (1972). Each LLM agent is modeled as a firm whose production set Y a $\subset$ H = L 2 ([0, T ], R R ) represents the feasible metric trajectories determined by its frozen model weights. The orchestrator is the consumer, choosing a routing policy over the agent DAG to maximize system welfare subject to a budget constraint evaluated at functional prices p $\in$ H A . These prices-elements of the Hilbert dual of the commodity space-assign a shadow value to each metric of each agent at each instant. We prove, via Brouwer's theorem applied to a finitedimensional approximation V K $\subset$ H, that every such economy admits at least one general equilibrium (p * , y * , $π$ * ). A functional Walras' law  holds as a theorem: the value of functional excess demand is zero for all prices, as a consequence of the consumer's budget constraint-not by construction. We further establish Pareto optimality (First Welfare Theorem), decentralizability of Pareto optima (Second Welfare Theorem), and uniqueness with geometric convergence under a contraction condition (Banach). The orchestration dynamics constitute a Walrasian t{â}tonnement that converges globally under the contraction condition, unlike classical t{â}tonnement (Scarf, 1960). The framework admits a DSGE interpretation with SLO parameters as policy rates.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The boundary of the firm is determined by coordination cost. We argue that agentic AI induces a structural change in how coordination costs scale: in prior modular systems, integration cost grew with interaction topology (O(n^2) in the number of components); in protocol-mediated agentic systems, integration cost collapses to O(n) while verification scales with task throughput rather than interaction count. This shift selects for a specific organizational equilibrium -- the Headless Firm -- structured as an hourglass: a personalized generative interface at the top, a standardized protocol waist in the middle, and a competitive market of micro-specialized execution agents at the bottom. We formalize this claim as a coordination cost model with two falsifiable empirical predictions: (1) the marginal cost of adding an execution provider should be approximately constant in a mature hourglass ecosystem; (2) the ratio of total coordination cost to task throughput should remain stable as ecosystem size grows. We derive conditions for hourglass stability versus re-centralization and analyze implications for firm size distributions, labor markets, and software economics. The analysis predicts a domain-conditional Great Unbundling: in high knowledge-velocity domains, firm size distributions shift mass from large integrated incumbents toward micro-specialized agents and thin protocol orchestrators.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Congestion pricing has emerged as an effective tool for mitigating traffic congestion, yet implementing welfare or revenue-optimal dynamic tolls is often impractical. Most real-world congestion pricing deployments, including New York City's recent program, rely on significantly simpler, often static, tolls. This discrepancy motivates the question of how much revenue and welfare loss there is when real-world traffic systems use static rather than optimal dynamic pricing.
  We address this question by analyzing the performance gap between static (simple) and dynamic (optimal) congestion pricing schemes in two canonical frameworks: Vickrey's bottleneck model with a public transit outside option and its city-scale extension based on the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD). In both models, we first characterize the revenue-optimal static and dynamic tolling policies, which have received limited attention in prior work. In the worst-case, revenue-optimal static tolls achieve at least half of the dynamic optimal revenue and at most twice the minimum achievable system cost across a wide range of practically relevant parameter regimes, with stronger and more general guarantees in the bottleneck model than in the MFD model. We further corroborate our theoretical guarantees with numerical results based on real-world datasets from the San Francisco Bay Area and New York City, which demonstrate that static tolls achieve roughly 80-90% of the dynamic optimal revenue while incurring at most a 8-20% higher total system cost than the minimum achievable system cost.

Abstract: We study the discrete Bertrand pricing game with a non-increasing demand function. The game has $n \ge 2$ players who simultaneously choose prices from the set $\{1/k, 2/k, \ldots, 1\}$, where $k\in\mathbb{N}$. The player who sets the lowest price captures the entire demand; if multiple players tie for the lowest price, they split the demand equally.
  We study the Bertrand paradox, where classical theory predicts low prices, yet real markets often sustain high prices. To understand this gap, we analyze a repeated-game model in which firms set prices using no-regret learners. Our goal is to characterize the equilibrium outcomes that can arise under different no-regret learning guarantees. We are particularly interested in questions such as whether no-external-regret learners can converge to undesirable high-price outcomes, and how stronger guarantees such as no-swap regret shape the emergence of competitive low-price behavior. We address these and related questions through a theoretical analysis, complemented by experiments that support the theory and reveal surprising phenomena for no-swap regret learners.

Abstract: Extensive-form games (EFGs) provide a powerful framework for modeling sequential decision making, capturing strategic interaction under imperfect information, chance events, and temporal structure. Most positive algorithmic and theoretical results for EFGs assume perfect recall, where players remember all past information and actions. We study the increasingly relevant setting of imperfect-recall EFGs (IREFGs), where players may forget parts of their history or previously acquired information, and where equilibrium computation is provably hard. We propose sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchies for computing ex-ante optimal strategies in single-player IREFGs and Nash equilibria in multi-player IREFGs, working over behavioral strategies. Our theoretical results show that (i) these hierarchies converge asymptotically, (ii) under genericity assumptions, the convergence is finite, and (iii) in single-player non-absentminded IREFGs, convergence occurs at a finite level determined by the number of information sets. Finally, we introduce the new classes of (SOS)-concave and (SOS)-monotone IREFGs, and show that in the single-player setting the SOS hierarchy converges at the first level, enabling equilibrium computation with a single semidefinite program (SDP).

Abstract: As commerce shifts to digital marketplaces, platforms increasingly monetize traffic through Sponsored Shopping auctions. Unlike classic ``Sponsored Search", where an advertiser typically bids for a single link, these settings involve advertisers with broad catalogs of distinct products. In these auctions, a single advertiser can secure multiple slots simultaneously to promote different items within the same query. This creates a fundamental complexity: the allocation is combinatorial, as advertisers simultaneously win a bundle of slots rather than a single position.
  We study this setting through the lens of autobidding, where value-maximizing agents employ uniform bidding strategies to optimize total value subject to Return-on-Investment (ROI) constraints. We analyze two prevalent auction formats: Generalized Second-Price (GSP) and Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG). Our first main contribution is establishing the universal existence of an Autobidding Equilibrium for both settings. Second, we prove a tight Price of Anarchy (PoA) of 2 for both mechanisms.

Abstract: There are $n$ players who compete by timing their actions. An opportunity appears randomly on a time interval. Whoever takes an action the fastest after the opportunity has arisen wins. The occurrence of the opportunity is observed only with a delay. Taking actions is costly. We characterize the unique symmetric equilibrium of this game and study worst-case inefficiency of equilibria. Our main motivation is the study of ``probabilistic backrunning" on blockchains, where arbitrageurs want to place an order immediately after a trade that impacts the price on an exchange or after an oracle update. In this context, the number of actions taken can be interpreted as a measure of costly ``spam" generated to compete for the opportunity.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Convex Agreement (CA) strengthens Byzantine Agreement (BA) by requiring the output agreed upon to lie in the convex hull of the honest parties' inputs. This validity condition is motivated by practical aggregation tasks (e.g., robust learning or sensor fusion) where honest inputs need not coincide but should still constrain the decision. CA inherits BA lower bounds, and optimal synchronous round complexity is easy to obtain (e.g., via Byzantine Broadcast). The main challenge is \emph{communication}: standard approaches for CA have a communication complexity of $Θ(Ln^2)$ for large $L$-bit inputs, leaving a gap in contrast to BA's lower bound of $Ω(Ln)$ bits. While recent work achieves optimal communication complexity of $O(Ln)$ for sufficiently large $L$ [GLW,PODC'25], translating this result to general convexity spaces remained an open problem.
  We investigate this gap for abstract convexity spaces, and we present deterministic synchronous CA protocols with near-optimal communication complexity: when $L = Ω(n \cdot κ)$, where $κ$ is a security parameter, we achieve $O(L\cdot n\log n)$ communication for finite convexity spaces and $O(L\cdot n^{1+o(1)})$ communication for Euclidean spaces $\mathbb{R}^d$. Our protocols have asymptotically optimal round complexity $O(n)$ and, when a bound on the inputs' lengths $L$ is fixed a priori, we achieve near-optimal resilience $t < n/(ω+\varepsilon)$ for any constant $\varepsilon>0$, where $ω$ is the Helly number of the convexity space. If $L$ is unknown, we still achieve resilience $t<n/(ω+\varepsilon+1)$ for any constant $\varepsilon > 0$. We further note that our protocols can be leveraged to efficiently solve parallel BA.
  Our main technical contribution is the use of extractor graphs to obtain a deterministic assignment of parties to committees, which is resilient against adaptive adversaries.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The performance of multi-turn, agentic LLM inference is increasingly dominated by KV-Cache storage I/O rather than computation. In prevalent disaggregated architectures, loading the massive KV-Cache from external storage creates a fundamental imbalance: storage NICs on prefill engines become bandwidth-saturated, while those on decoding engines remain idle. This asymmetry severely constrains overall system throughput.
  We present DualPath, an inference system that breaks this bottleneck by introducing dual-path KV-Cache loading. Beyond the traditional storage-to-prefill path, DualPath enables a novel storage-to-decode path, in which the KV-Cache is loaded into decoding engines and then efficiently transferred to prefill engines via RDMA over the compute network. DualPath combines this optimized data path -- which inherently avoids network congestion and avoids interference with latency-critical model execution communications -- with a global scheduler that dynamically balances load across prefill and decode engines.
  Our evaluation on three models with production agentic workloads demonstrates that DualPath improves offline inference throughput by up to 1.87$\times$ on our in-house inference system. It can also improve online serving throughput by an average factor of 1.96$\times$ without violating SLO.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of tasks, but serving them efficiently at scale remains a critical challenge due to their substantial computational and latency demands. While most existing inference frameworks rely on simple scheduling strategies such as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) at the engine level and Round-Robin (RR) at the scheduler or coordinator level, they often fail to fully utilize system resources and may suffer from issues such as head-of-line blocking and load imbalance. Recent advances in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have also introduced new challenges in scheduling arising from expert parallelism and routing complexity. This research proposes a multi-layer scheduling framework tailored for MoE-based LLM serving. It targets scheduling at three levels: request-level, enginelevel, and expert-level. At the request level, we explore algorithms such as Shortest-Job-First (SJF) and priority-aware aging to improve throughput and reduce latency. At the engine level, we design load-aware dispatching strategies that account for the current prefix token load, KV cache utilization, and user stickiness to achieve better resource matching. At the expert level, we focus on alleviating expert hotspots and strategically placing inter-layer expert dependencies to balance load and improve routing efficiency. Extensive experimental results from more than 100 experiments conducted under diverse workload distributions show that our approach consistently outperforms the state-of-theart inference framework vLLM, achieving up to 17.8% reduction in Time To First Token (TTFT) latency and 13.3% reduction in Time-Per-Output-Token (TPOT) latency.

Abstract: Lamport's 1978 paper introduced the happens-before relation and logical clocks, freeing distributed systems from dependence on synchronized physical clocks. This is widely understood as a move away from Newtonian absolute time. We argue that Lamport's formalism retains a deeper and largely unexamined assumption: that causality induces a globally well-defined directed acyclic graph (DAG) over events -- a forward-in-time-only (FITO) structure that functions as an arrow of time embedded at the semantic level. Following Ryle's analysis of category mistakes, we show that this assumption conflates an epistemic construct (the logical ordering of messages) with an ontic claim (that physical causality is globally acyclic and monotonic). We trace this conflation through Shannon's channel model, TLA+, Bell's theorem, and the impossibility results of Fischer-Lynch-Paterson and Brewer's CAP theorem. We then show that special and general relativity permit only local causal structure, and that recent work on indefinite causal order demonstrates that nature admits correlations with no well-defined causal ordering. We propose that mutual information conservation, rather than temporal precedence, provides a more fundamental primitive for distributed consistency.

Abstract: Scaling long-context capabilities is crucial for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, real-world multimodal datasets are extremely heterogeneous. Existing training frameworks predominantly rely on static parallelism strategies, which suffer from severe load imbalance, redundant communication, and suboptimal hardware utilization under data heterogeneity. In this work, we propose Dynamic Hybrid Parallelism (DHP), an efficient parallelism strategy that adaptively reconfigures communication groups and parallelism degrees during MLLM training. We generalize the non-power-of-two parallelism degrees and develop a polynomial-time algorithm to generate near-optimal parallelism strategies with only millisecond-level overhead per training batch. DHP is able to maintain high hardware efficiency even under extreme data variability. Experimental results demonstrate that DHP significantly outperforms Megatron-LM and DeepSpeed, achieving up to 1.36 $\times$ speedup in training throughput while maintaining near-linear scaling efficiency across large-scale NPU clusters.

Abstract: Heterogeneous nodes that combine multi-core CPUs with diverse accelerators are rapidly becoming the norm in both high-performance computing (HPC) and AI infrastructures. Exploiting these platforms, however, requires orchestrating several low-level accelerator APIs such as CUDA, SYCL, and Triton. In some occasions they can be combined with optimized vendor math libraries: e.g., cuBLAS and oneAPI. Each API or library introduces its own abstractions, execution semantics, and synchronization mechanisms. Combining them within a single application is therefore error-prone and labor-intensive. We propose reusing a task-based data-flow methodology together with Task-Aware APIs (TA-libs) to overcome these limitations and facilitate the seamless integration of multiple accelerator programming models, while still leveraging the best-in-class kernels offered by each API.
  Applications are expressed as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of host tasks and device kernels managed by an OpenMP/OmpSs-2 runtime. We introduce Task-Aware SYCL (TASYCL) and leverage Task-Aware CUDA (TACUDA), which elevate individual accelerator invocations to first-class tasks. When multiple native runtimes coexist on the same multi-core CPU, they contend for threads, leading to oversubscription and performance variability. To address this, we unify their thread management under the nOS-V tasking and threading library, to which we contribute a new port of the PoCL (Portable OpenCL) runtime.
  These results demonstrate that task-aware libraries, coupled with the nOS-V library, enable a single application to harness multiple accelerator programming models transparently and efficiently. The proposed methodology is immediately applicable to current heterogeneous nodes and is readily extensible to future systems that integrate even richer combinations of CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and AI accelerators.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a problem of minimizing total energy consumption for secure federated learning (FL) over wireless edge networks. To address the high computational cost and privacy challenges in conventional FL with neural networks (NN) for resource-constrained users, we propose a novel FL with hyperdimensional computing and differential privacy (FL-HDC-DP) framework. In the considered model, each edge user employs hyperdimensional computing (HDC) for local training, which replaces complex neural updates with simple hypervector operations, and applies differential privacy (DP) noise to protect transmitted model information. We optimize the total energy of computation and communication under both latency and privacy constraints. We formulate the problem as an optimization that minimizes the total energy of all users by jointly allocating HDC dimension, transmission time, system bandwidth, transmit power, and CPU frequency. To solve this problem, a sigmoid-variant function is proposed to characterize the relationship between the HDC dimension and the convergence rounds required to reach a target accuracy. Based on this model, we develop two alternating optimization algorithms, where closed-form expressions for time, frequency, bandwidth, and power allocations are derived at each iteration. Since the iterative algorithm requires a feasible initialization, we construct a feasibility problem and obtain feasible initial resource parameters by solving a per round transmission time minimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FL-HDC-DP framework achieves up to 83.3% total energy reduction compared with the baseline, while attaining about 90% accuracy in approximately 3.5X fewer communication rounds than the NN baseline.

Abstract: As the complexity of the HPC storage stack rapidly grows, domain scientists face increasing challenges in effectively utilizing HPC storage systems to achieve their desired I/O performance. To identify and address I/O issues, scientists largely rely on I/O experts to analyze their I/O traces and provide insights into potential problems. However, with a limited number of I/O experts and the growing demand for data-intensive applications, inaccessibility has become a major bottleneck, hindering scientists from maximizing their productivity. Rapid advances in LLMs make it possible to build an automated tool that brings trustworthy I/O performance diagnosis to domain scientists. However, key challenges remain, such as the inability to handle long context windows, a lack of accurate domain knowledge about HPC I/O, and the generation of hallucinations during complex interactions.In this work, we propose IOAgent as a systematic effort to address these challenges. IOAgent integrates a module-based pre-processor, a RAG-based domain knowledge integrator, and a tree-based merger to accurately diagnose I/O issues from a given Darshan trace file. Similar to an I/O expert, IOAgent provides detailed justifications and references for its diagnoses and offers an interactive interface for scientists to ask targeted follow-up questions. To evaluate IOAgent, we collected a diverse set of labeled job traces and released the first open diagnosis test suite, TraceBench. Using this test suite, we conducted extensive evaluations, demonstrating that IOAgent matches or outperforms state-of-the-art I/O diagnosis tools with accurate and useful diagnosis results. We also show that IOAgent is not tied to specific LLMs, performing similarly well with both proprietary and open-source LLMs. We believe IOAgent has the potential to become a powerful tool for scientists navigating complex HPC I/O subsystems in the future.

Abstract: The increasing complexity and diversity of hardware accelerators in modern computing systems demand flexible, low-overhead program analysis tools. We present PASTA, a low-overhead and modular Program AnalysiS Tool Framework for Accelerators. PASTA abstracts over low-level profiling APIs and diverse deep learning frameworks, offering users a unified interface to capture and analyze runtime events at multiple levels. Its extensible design enables researchers and practitioners to rapidly prototype custom tools with minimal overhead. We demonstrate the utility of PASTA by developing several analysis tools, including a deep learning workload characterization tool and a UVM optimization tool. Through extensive evaluation on mainstream deep learning workloads tested on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs under both single- and multi-GPU scenarios, we demonstrate PASTA's broad applicability. On NVIDIA GPUs, we further show that PASTA provides detailed performance insights with significantly lower overhead, up to 1.3*10^4 faster than conventional analysis tools, thanks to its GPU-accelerated backend. PASTA strikes a practical balance between usability, extensibility, and efficiency, making it well-suited for modern accelerator-based computing environments.

Abstract: Checkpointing is essential for fault tolerance in training large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods, regardless of their I/O strategies, periodically store the entire model and optimizer states, incurring substantial storage overhead and resource contention. Recent studies reveal that updates across LLM layers are highly non-uniform. Across training steps, some layers may undergo more significant changes, while others remain relatively stable or even unchanged. This suggests that selectively checkpointing only layers with significant updates could reduce overhead without harming training. Implementing such selective strategies requires fine-grained control over both weights and optimizer states, which no current tool provides. To address this gap, we propose \texttt{LLMTailor}, a checkpoint-merging framework that filters and assembles layers from different checkpoints to form a composite checkpoint. Our evaluation indicates that LLMTailor can work with different selective checkpointing strategies and effectively reduce checkpoint size (e.g., 4.3 times smaller for Llama3.1-8B) and checkpoint time (e.g., 2.8 times faster for Qwen2.5-7B) while maintaining model quality.

Abstract: Hierarchical quantum classifiers, such as quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs), represent recent progress toward designing effective and feasible architectures for quantum classification. However, their performance on near-term quantum hardware remains highly sensitive to noise accumulation across circuit depth, calling for strategies beyond circuit-architecture design alone. We propose a noise-adaptive hybrid QCNN that improves classification under noise by exploiting depth-stratified intermediate measurements. Instead of discarding qubits removed during pooling operations, we measure them and use the resulting outcomes as classical features that are jointly processed by a classical neural network. This hybrid hierarchical design enables noise-adaptive inference by integrating quantum intermediate measurements with classical post-processing. Systematic experiments across multiple circuit sizes and noise settings, including hardware-calibrated noise models derived from IBM Quantum backend data, demonstrate more stable convergence, reduced loss variability, and consistently higher classification accuracy compared with standard QCNNs. Moreover, we observe that this performance advantage significantly amplifies as the circuit size increases, confirming that the hybrid architecture mitigates the scaling limitations of standard architectures. Notably, the multi-basis measurement variant attains performance close to the noiseless limit even under realistic noise. While demonstrated for QCNNs, the proposed depth-stratified feature extraction applies more broadly to hierarchical quantum classifiers that progressively discard qubits.

Abstract: As quantum processors scale beyond 100 qubits, distinguishing software bugs from stochastic hardware noise becomes a critical diagnostic challenge. We present a neuro-fuzzy framework that addresses this attribution problem by combining Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) with physics-grounded feature engineering. We introduce the Bhattacharyya Veto, a hard physical constraint grounded in the Data Processing Inequality that prevents the classifier from attributing topologically impossible output distributions to noise. Validated on IBM's 156-qubit Heron r2 processor (ibm_fez) across 105 circuits spanning 17 algorithm families, the framework achieves 89.5% effective accuracy (+/- 5.9% CI). The system implements a safe failure mode, flagging 14.3% of ambiguous cases for manual review rather than forcing low-confidence predictions. We resolve key ambiguities -- such as distinguishing correct Grover amplification from bug-induced collapse -- and identify fundamental limits of single-basis diagnostics, including a Z-basis blind spot where phase-flip errors remain statistically invisible. This work establishes a robust, interpretable diagnostic layer that prevents error mitigation techniques from being applied to logically flawed circuits.

Abstract: We analyze decoherence in a one-loop Stern--Gerlach--type matter-wave interferometer for a massive nanoparticle embedded with a nitrogen vacancy (NV)-centred nanodiamond evolving under an effective harmonic-oscillator dynamics in a magnetic-field gradient. We assume that the Stern-Gerlach interferometer is subjected to a random acceleration noise external to the system. This could be along the direction of the superposition at an angle which can be varied. We quantify dephasing from two noise channels: fluctuations in the external acceleration $a(t)$ magnitude and direction as specified by the tilt angle $θ_0(t)$ between the superposition axis and the acceleration. At the level of the action, we treat these two external noise as stochastic inputs, and compute the resulting stochastic arm-phase difference, and obtain the dephasing rate $Γ$ using the Wiener--Khinchin theorem. For a white noise and a coherence target $Γτ\leq 1$ and by assuming that we finish the one-loop interferometer within $τ=2π/ω_0\simeq 0.015~\mathrm{s}$, for a reasonable choice of the magnetic field gradient, $η_0=6\times 10^{3}~\mathrm{T\,m^{-1}}$ and mass of the nanodiamond, $m=10^{-15}~\mathrm{kg}$) to create a superposition size of $Δx\sim 1$nm. We find $\sqrt{\mathcal{S}_{aa}}\lesssim \mathcal{O}(10^{-11})~\mathrm{m\,s^{-2}\,Hz^{-1/2}}$ even if we take the external acceleration, $a=0~{\rm ms^{-2}}$ and $θ_0=0^\circ$ (along the dirction of the superposition), and $\sqrt{\mathcal{S}_{θθ}}\lesssim \mathcal{O}(10^{-10})~\mathrm{rad\,Hz^{-1/2}}$ for $a=g= 9.81~\mathrm{m\,s^{-2}}$ and $θ_0=0^\circ$ (superposition direction is perpendicular to the Earth's gravity). We have also found an operating regime where the acceleration noise can be minimized by either varying $θ_0$ or $a$ for a fixed set of other experimental parameters.

Abstract: The topological surface code is a leading candidate for harnessing long-range entanglement to protect logical quantum information against errors, and teleportation of logical states is desirable for robust quantum information processing. Nevertheless, scaling up the surface code in quantum teleportation poses a formidable challenge to experiment. Here on a superconducting quantum processor with 125 qubits, we demonstrate the robust teleportation of topological rotated surface code prepared by a linear-depth unitary circuit, with code distances up to 7. We obtain the teleportation phase diagram by tuning the local entangling gates uniformly across a finite threshold. Furthermore, we show that the entangling threshold can be boosted by coherent qubit rotations that inject magic resources beyond the Clifford regime, restoring the duality symmetry of the topological phase, which serves as a guiding principle to minimize the entanglement resource. Our results shed light on simulating and leveraging topological quantum matter on quantum devices, and pave the way to the ultimate goal of distributed fault tolerant quantum computation.

Abstract: Here we analyze ways to achieve deep subthreshold parametric squeezing or cooling of a single degree-of-freedom parametric resonator enhanced by a lock-in amplifier feedback loop. Due to the feedback, the dynamics of the parametric resonator becomes more complex and a Hopf bifurcation at the instability threshold can occur. Initially, we calculate the phase-dependent gain of parametric amplification with feedback of an added ac signal. In one approach, we obtain the amplification gain approximately using two independent approaches: the averaging method and the harmonic balance method. We also obtain this gain more exactly using Floquet theory and Green's functions methods. The Hopf bifurcation was predicted by the harmonic balance method and by Floquet theory, but not by the averaging method. In our analysis of fluctuations, we Fourier analyze the response of the parametric resonator with feedback to an added white noise. We were able to calculate, in addition to the noise spectral density, the squeezing of fluctuations in this resonator with feedback. Very strong squeezing or cooling can occur. Deamplification and cooling occur near the Hopf bifurcation, whereas squeezing occurs near a saddle-node bifurcation.

Abstract: We study a novel repumping transition for $^{88}$Sr atoms trapped in a 'blue' magneto-optical trap. We show that, while the repumping efficiency is about three orders of magnitude smaller than for traditional schemes, it is sufficient for recycling all atoms, provided the repumping laser beams are arranged to form a 'green' magneto- optical trap (MOT) helping to cool and confine the atoms and preventing their loss. Our main findings are: (i) that the green MOT configuration is able to trap 10 times more atoms in the blue MOT than using the green transition merely as a repump, and (ii) that the atom numbers in the two-color MOT can be balanced through experimental control parameters. The interest of this scheme lies in its capability of reaching low temperature and its suitability for continuous atomic beam generation.

Abstract: In Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and Quantum Finance, amplitude encoding is often motivated by its logarithmic storage capacity arXiv:1307.0411. This paradigm typically relies on the mapping $ψ= \sqrt{P}$, treating the quantum state as a derivative of a classical probability distribution $P$. By restricting the data manifold to the positive real orthant $\mathcal{S}^+$, the accessible Hilbert space is effectively abelianized, rendering the representation ``phase-deaf''. We rigorously establish that while $P$ is a projection of $|ψ|^2$, the simple square-root mapping fails to recover the non-commutative structure necessary for genuine quantum advantage in classification tasks. Furthermore, we clarify why applying basis changes (like Hadamard gates) to these states fails to replicate the computational power of active phase-kickback mechanisms. Finally, we advocate for Dynamical Hamiltonian Encoding (based on QIFT), where data generates non-commutative evolution rather than serving as a static, phase-locked vector.

Abstract: Demonstrating genuine many-body quantum coherence in large-scale quantum processors remains a central challenge for near-term quantum technologies. Recent experiments on D-Wave quantum annealers have investigated quenches of Ising chains and observed defect densities that show Kibble-Zurek scaling, consistent with coherent quantum dynamics. However, identical scaling can arise from classical or thermal processes. Here we propose the use of many-body coherent oscillations (MBCO) as a diagnostic for the identification of system-wide coherence in analog quantum simulators. Solving the time-dependent Schrodinger equation, we show that quenches of a staggered one-dimensional Ising chain across a quantum critical point produce oscillatory signatures in defect observables. We implement this model on the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer. Using fast-anneal protocols, we find that, although defect densities follow Kibble-Zurek scaling, the expected oscillatory behavior is absent. We demonstrate that static disorder associated with individual qubits is not likely responsible for the absence of MBCO. Modest modifications to annealing schedules can dramatically enhance oscillation visibility. This work gives a general roadmap for the search for quantum coherence in noisy, large-scale quantum platforms.

Abstract: We introduce Natural Qubit Algebra (NQA), a compact real operator calculus for qubit systems based on a $2\times2$ block alphabet $\{I,X,Z,W\}\subset\mathrm{Mat}(2,\mathbb{R})$ and tensor-word representations. The resulting multiplication law induces a canonical $(\mathbb{Z}_2)^{2m}$-grading with a bicharacter that controls commutation signs, placing the framework naturally within the theory of color-graded and Clifford-type algebras.
  Within this language, we provide: (i) an explicit real Clifford normal form for two-qubit operators via the identification $\mathrm{Mat}(4,\mathbb{R})\cong\mathrm{Cl}(2,2;\mathbb{R})$; (ii) a purely algebraic reformulation of the Bell--CHSH scenario, where the quantum violation is expressed as a spectral non-embeddability of a noncommutative spinor algebra into any commutative Kolmogorov algebra; and (iii) compact factored representations of the Bernstein--Vazirani and Grover phase oracles, showing that both Clifford and non-Clifford examples can admit similarly structured symbolic descriptions.
  We clarify that Grover's iterate remains outside the Clifford group due to its continuous spectral rotation, consistent with the Gottesman--Knill theorem, while retaining a compact tensor-block form in NQA. The framework isolates spectral, algebraic, and syntactic aspects of operator structure, providing a graded operator language compatible with standard quantum mechanics.

Abstract: Embedding non-Markovian open quantum dynamics into an enlarged Markovian space offers a powerful route to nonperturbative simulations, where the dynamics of the extended space can be governed by multiple distinct Markovian equations. We show that these distinct embeddings arise from different unravelings of Gaussian bath self-energies, generating a family of deterministic, time-local equations for the extended system. Using the Brownian-oscillator spectral density as an illustrative example, we clarify the relationships among existing approaches, including the Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM) and the Lindblad--pseudomode formalism, and demonstrate how this framework enables numerically stable and efficient simulations. This work provides both a transparent theoretical foundation for embedding techniques and a flexible platform for developing new methods to simulate non-Markovian quantum dynamics.

Abstract: The Adler equation is a well-known one-dimensional model describing phase locking and synchronization. Motivated by recent experiments using optomechanical oscillators, we extend the model to include overtone-synthesized sinusoidal coupling with adiabatic temporal modulation. This extension gives rise to unique topological features such as winding-number quantization, discontinuous phase-slip transitions, and hysteretic and non-reciprocal phase dynamics. We further extend the analysis to the quantum regime, where we find a counterintuitive result: the breakdown of winding-number quantization. This arises from the superposition of different winding-number states in a closed-space Thouless pump. Moreover, hysteretic dynamics, once eliminated in quantum adiabatic approximation, is recovered in non-adiabatic calculations, as the superposition of two Floquet states with different PT eigenvalues becomes the quantum counterpart of phase trajectory.

Abstract: We investigate the interplay between nonlinearity and inhomogeneities in discrete-time quantum walks on one-dimensional lattices. Nonlinear effects are introduced through a Kerr-like, intensity-dependent local phase, while spatial and temporal inhomogeneities are implemented via random variations of the quantum gate operations. By analyzing typical quantities, such as the return probability and the participation function, we identify distinct quantum walking regimes as the nonlinear parameter $χ$ and the quantum gate parameter $θ$ are varied. Spatial inhomogeneities weaken nonlinear self-trapping and constrict the region of robust localization. In this process, partially localized regimes emerge, characterized by the coexistence of a confined core and dispersive wave-packet components. In contrast, temporal inhomogeneities act as time-dependent perturbations that continuously disrupt the phase coherence required for self-trapped excitation, thereby enhancing dispersive emission and promoting delocalization. By using $χ$ versus $θ$ diagrams, we display a comprehensive characterization of how inhomogeneities modify the stability and extent of prevailing dynamical regimes, elucidating the competition between nonlinearity and inhomogeneities in discrete-time quantum walks.

Abstract: We demonstrate a robust, high-visibility nonlocal Franson interferometry for fiber-based quantum networks by co-propagating a classical Radio-over-Fiber clock signal with energy-time entangled photon pairs in the same fiber. Utilizing cross-band allocation (O-band for classical, L-band for quantum signals), the spontaneous Raman scattering noise photons are effectively suppressed. At the same time, their environmental delay fluctuations remain highly correlated for common-mode noise cancellation, achieving a passive synchronization with picoseconds precision. Over 50 km of single-mode fiber, this co-propagation enables nonlocal quantum interference with a visibility of (88.35\pm3.62)%, without relying on external dedicated timing infrastructure. This work provides a practical, scalable synchronization solution for metropolitan-scale entanglement-based quantum networks.

Abstract: In this work, we show that the sample complexity (equivalently, the number of measurements) required in quantum learning theory within a general parametric framework, is fundamentally governed by the inverse Fisher information matrix. More specifically, we derive upper and lower bounds on the number of samples required to estimate the parameters of a quantum system within a prescribed small additive error and with high success probability under maximum likelihood estimation. The upper bound is governed by the supremum of the largest diagonal entry of the inverse Fisher information matrix, while the lower bound is characterized by any diagonal element evaluated at arbitrary parameter values. We then apply the general bounds to Pauli channel learning and to the estimation of Pauli expectation values in the asymptotic small-error regime, and recover the previously established sample complexity through considerably streamlined derivations. Furthermore, we identify the structural origin of exponential sample complexity in Pauli channel learning without entanglement and in Pauli expectation value estimation without quantum memory. We then extend the analysis to an error criterion based on the Euclidean distance between the true parameter values and their estimators. We derive the corresponding upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity, which are likewise characterized by the inverse Fisher information matrix. As an application, we consider Pauli expectation estimation with entangled probes. Finally, we highlight two fundamental contributions to quantum learning theory. First, we establish a systematic framework that determines the task-independent sample complexity under maximum-likelihood estimation. Second, we show that, in the small-error regime, learning sample complexity is governed by the inverse Fisher information matrix.

Abstract: Sybil resistance is a key requirement of decentralized consensus protocols. It is achieved by introducing a scarce resource (such as computational power, monetary stake, disk space, etc.), which prevents participants from costlessly creating multiple fake identities and hijacking the protocol. Quantum states are generically uncloneable, which suggests that they may serve naturally as an unconditionally scarce resource. In particular, uncloneability underlies quantum position based-cryptography, which is unachievable classically. We design a consensus protocol that combines classical hybrid consensus protocols with quantum position verification as the Sybil resistance mechanism, providing security in the standard model, and achieving improved energy efficiency compared to hybrid protocols based on Proof-of-Work. Our protocol inherits the benefits of other hybrid protocols, namely the faster confirmation times compared to pure Proof-of-Work protocols, and resilience against the compounding wealth issue that plagues protocols based on Proof-of-Stake Sybil resistance. We additionally propose a spam prevention mechanism for our protocol in the Random Oracle model.

In this work, we develop a fast implementation of two-qubit CZ gates using optimized ancillary drive to enhance the two-photon Rabi frequency between the ground and Rydberg states.This ancillary drive can work in an error-robustness framework without increasing the original gate infidelity in the absence of the drive. Considering the experimentally feasible parameters for $^{87}$Rb atoms, we demonstrate that the execution time required for such CZ gates can be shortened by more than 30$\%$ as compared to standard two-photon protocols arising the gate fidelity above 0.9954 by taking account of all relevant error sources. Our results reduce the high-power laser requirement and unlock the potential toward fast, high-fidelity quantum operations for large-scale quantum computation with neutral atoms.

Abstract: In this paper, we will provide a complete derivation of the decoherence rate for a magnetic nanoparticle in quantum superposition in the presence of the fluctuating electromagnetic field in a thermal background by using the fluctuation-dissipation theorem in the long-wavelength limit. The long-wavelength limit assumes that the superposition size is much smaller than the wavelength of the electromagentic filed fluctuations. We will extend this computation to two diamagnetic nanoparticles kept in quantum superposition adjacent to each other. We will also show how the drag force on a single nanoparticle arises from external electromagnetic-field fluctuations, and compare our results with those for the nanoparticle's dielectric properties.

Abstract: We proposed a time-delayed quantum extreme learning machine (TD-QELM) for efficient time-series prediction on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. By encoding multiple past inputs simultaneously, TD-QELM achieves shallow circuit depth independent of sequence length, thereby, mitigating noise accumulation and reducing computational complexity. Experiments using the NARMA benchmark on both noiseless simulations and IBM's 127-qubit processor demonstrate that TD-QELM consistently outperforms conventional quantum reservoir computing in prediction accuracy and noise robustness. These results highlight TD-QELM as a practical and scalable framework for time-series learning on current NISQ hardware.

Abstract: As quantum information systems mature, efficient and coherent transfer of quantum information through noisy channels becomes increasingly important. We examine how passive environment-assisted quantum communication enhances direct quantum information transfer efficiency. A bosonic pure-loss channel, modeled as transmission through a beam splitter with a vacuum input state at the dark port, has zero quantum capacity when transmissivity is below 50%. Quantum communication through the channel can be enhanced by passive environment assistance, achieved via the selection of an appropriate input state for the ancilla port. Although ideal Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states enable perfect quantum information transmission at arbitrarily small transmissivity, they are challenging to realize experimentally. We therefore explore more experimentally accessible non-Gaussian ancilla states, such as Fock, cat, and squeezed cat states, and numerically determine the optimal encoding and decoding strategies. We also construct analytical schemes that yield high-fidelity transmission and good information rates.

Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm proposed for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices and is regarded as a promising approach to combinatorial optimization problems, with potential applications in the financial sector. In this study, we apply QAOA to the portfolio optimization problem, which is one of the central challenges in financial engineering. A portfolio consists of a combination of multiple assets, and the portfolio optimization problem aims to determine the optimal asset allocation by balancing expected return and risk. In the context of quantum optimization, portfolio optimization is often formulated using discrete variables. Unlike conventional binary formulations, we consider a ternary portfolio optimization problem that accounts for three states-holding, not holding, and short selling-and compare its performance using different mixer operators. Specifically, we implement QAOA with the standard mixer and several XY Mixers (XY Ring, XY Parity Ring, XY Full, and QAMPA), and conducted simulations using real data based on the German stock index (DAX 30) for portfolios consisting of 5 and 8 assets. Furthermore, we introduce noise based on a depolarizing channel to investigate the behavior of the algorithm in realistic environments. The results show that while XY Mixers exhibit superiority in noiseless settings, their advantage degrades in noisy environments, and the optimal choice of mixer depends on both the number of QAOA depths and the noise strength.

Abstract: Circuit quantum acoustodynamics (cQAD) devices have a wide range of applications in quantum science, all of which depend crucially on the quantum coherence of the mechanical subsystem. In this context, high-overtone bulk acoustic-wave resonators (HBARs) are particularly promising, since they have shown very high quality factors with negligible dephasing. However, the introduction of piezoelectric films, which are necessary for coupling to a superconducting circuit, can lead to additional loss channels, such as surface scattering and two-level systems (TLS). Here, we study the acoustic dissipation of HBAR resonators in cQAD systems and find that the defect density of the piezoelectric material and its interface with the bulk are limiting factors for the coherence. We measure acoustic modes with phonon lifetimes up to 400 $μ$s and lifetime-limited coherence times approaching one millisecond in the quantum regime. When coupled to a superconducting qubit, this leads to a hybrid system with a large quantum coherence cooperativity of $C_{T_2}=1.1\times10^5$. These results represent a new milestone for the performance of cQAD devices and offer concrete paths forward for further improvements.

Abstract: We propose a method to directly recover the degree of entanglement distributed by entanglement swapping in the presence of noise. Our approach introduces a reversing operation that probabilistically undoes the effect of amplitude damping or photon loss on a single entangled pair, enabling heralded recovery of entanglement. We demonstrate that entanglement can be substantially recovered even under strong noise, including parameter regimes where the distributed entanglement would otherwise vanish due to entanglement sudden death. We analyze the effectiveness of the protocol in two representative repeater models, i.e.,~two-way and one-way architectures and identify the optimal reversing strategy. Due to its heralded and single-copy nature, our protocol is readily compatible with other entanglement recovery techniques such as entanglement purification and distillation. Our work provides a practical and experimentally feasible way toward robust entanglement distribution in current and near-term quantum repeater architectures.

Abstract: Exceptional points, where two or more eigenstates of a non-Hermitian system coalesce, are now of interest across many fields of physics, from the perspective of open-system dynamics, sensing, nonreciprocal transport, and topological phase transitions. In this work, we investigate exceptional points in cavity optomechanics, a platform of interest to diverse communities working on gravitational-wave detection, macroscopic quantum mechanics, quantum transduction, etc. Specifically, we clarify the role of quantum jumps in making a clear distinction between Liouvillian and Hamiltonian exceptional points in optomechanical systems. While the Liouvillian exceptional point arises from the unconditional Lindblad dynamics and is independent of the phonon-bath temperature, the Hamiltonian exceptional point emerges from the conditional no-jump evolution and acquires a thermal shift due to an enhanced conditional damping. Employing the thermofield formalism, we derive a unified spectral framework that interpolates between these regimes via an analytical hybrid-Liouvillian description. Remarkably, in the weak-quantum-jump regime, the exceptional point is perturbed only at the second order, highlighting the robustness of the Hamiltonian exceptional point under small hybrid perturbations. Our work reveals a continuous family of hybrid exceptional points, clarifies the operational and physical differences between the conditional and unconditional dissipative dynamics in optomechanical systems, and provides a probe for thermal baths.

Abstract: Wave--particle duality is a hallmark of quantum mechanics. For bosonic systems, there exists a continuum of intermediate states bridging wave-like Schrödinger cat states and particle-like Fock states. Such states have recently been recognized as valuable resources for enhancing fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) with propagating light. Here we experimentally demonstrate tunable generation of these intermediate states by employing generalized photon subtraction (GPS). By detecting up to three photons from squeezed-light sources with a photon-number-resolving detector, we continuously control the balance between wave- and particle-like features. This approach allows us to construct a spectral family of quantum states with high generation rates, optimized according to the required fault-tolerance threshold. Our results establish GPS as a versatile toolbox for tailoring non-Gaussian resources, opening a pathway to efficient Gottesman--Kitaev--Preskill (GKP) qubit generation and addressing a central bottleneck in optical quantum computing.

Abstract: Classical-quantum coexistence enables cost-effective transmission of data and quantum signals over the same fiber-optic channel. Nevertheless, weak quantum-key distribution (QKD) signals are susceptible to non-linear interference generated from the classical traffic, primarily spontaneous Raman scattering (SpRS) and four-wave-mixing (FWM), as well as to unfiltered noise. In QKD protocols, increased channel loss and excess noise both reduce the secret key rates (SKRs), as illustrated in this work for the two-state BB84 and Gaussian-modulated coherent-states (GMCS) protocols. In this study, we derive closed-form expressions for evaluating the accumulated interference power from coexisting classical signals in a quantum frequency channel. Our model enables effective design of classical-quantum systems in single-mode fibers (SMFs), capturing the evolution of interference arising from the relevant physical phenomena. We utilize the model to examine frequency allocation in multiband transmission systems, demonstrating that, contrary to common practice of allocating QKD channels in the O-band, increased SKR is achieved by placing quantum channels in the upper E-/lower S-band across the relevant scenarios.

Abstract: We formulate an infinite hierarchy of continuous-variable separability criteria in terms of quasiprobability distributions and their derivatives evaluated at individual points in phase space. Our approach is equivalent to the Peres--Horodecki criterion and sheds light on how distillable entanglement manifests in the phase-space picture. We demonstrate that already the lowest-order variant constitutes a powerful method for detecting the elusive non-Gaussian entanglement of relevant state families. Further, we devise a simple measurement scheme that relies solely on passive linear transformations and coherent ancillas. By strategically probing specific phase-space regions, our method offers clear advantages over existing techniques that rely on access to the full phase-space distributions.

Abstract: Across diverse synthetic and real-world interaction graphs, the variational landscapes of reduced Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) instances obtained via variable freezing exhibit a robust universality. Leveraging this structure, we introduce Doubly Optimized QAOA (DO-QAOA), which lowers runtime and quantum measurement overhead while maintaining a competitive approximation ratio gap (ARG). Adapting the replica-overlap framework of spin-glass physics, we define a landscape-overlap order parameter $q$ to quantify geometric correlations between energy landscapes, revealing a sharp landscape-similarity transition as graph connectivity is tuned. Notwithstanding this transition, the dominant convex features of nearly all conditioned sub-instances remain aligned across both phases. Exploiting this persistence, DO-QAOA collapses the nominal $2^m$ reduced instances generated by freezing $m$ qubits into $K = O(1)$ effective landscape classes, eliminating the exponential proliferation in $m$. By leveraging landscape structure, DO-QAOA provides a scalable route to hybrid quantum-classical optimization under realistic hardware constraints, with potential applicability across variational quantum algorithms.

Abstract: Matrix representations of quantum operators are computationally complete but often obscure the structural topology of information flow within a quantum circuit \cite{nielsen2000}. In this paper, we introduce a generalized graph-theoretic framework for analyzing quantum operators by mapping unitary matrices to directed graphs; we term these structures \emph{Imperfect Graphs} or more formally as \emph{Topological Structure of Superpositions}(TSS) as a tool to devise better Quantum Algorithms. In this framework, we represent computational basis states as vertices. A directed edge exists between two vertices if and only if there is a non-zero amplitude transition between them, effectively mapping the support of the unitary operator. In this paper we deliberately discard probability amplitudes and phase information to isolate the connectivity and reachability properties of the operator. We demonstrate how TSS intuitively helps describe gates such as the Hadamard, Pauli-(X,Y,Z) gates, etc \cite{nielsen2000}. This framework provides a novel perspective for viewing quantum circuits as discrete dynamical systems \cite{childs2009,aharonov2001}

Here we propose a universal and scalable scheme to generate large-scale GHZ-like states, which share similar entanglement and metrological properties with standard GHZ states, in lattice spin systems through global Floquet engineering. Our scheme requires only global operations and shows great advantage for large particle number. It is applicable to systems with arbitrary interaction ranges, offering a practical pathway for large-scale implementation of many-body entangled states in various systems.

We propose a hardware-friendly protocol that simulates non-Hermitian dynamics without continuous monitoring. Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) evolution via classical Gaussian white-noise averaging and to subsequently cancel the quantum-jump contribution at the level of the measured observable using stochastic quantum error mitigation (QEM). The scheme requires no ancillas or controlled time-evolution, while the mitigation layer uses only single-qubit operations. We validate the method through numerical simulations of a model with asymmetric hopping, interaction, and disorder. Our work provides a programmable and ancilla-free framework investigating exotic dynamics that are not completely-positive and trace-preserving using QEM.

Abstract: Qudits, or multi-level quantum information carriers, present a promising path for scaling quantum computers. However, their use introduces increased complexity in quantum logic, necessitating careful control of relative phases between different qudit levels. In trapped-ion systems, entangling operations accumulate phases on specific levels that are no longer global, unlike in qubit architectures. Furthermore, the structure of multi-level gates becomes increasingly intricate with higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces. This work explores the theory of these additional entangling and non-entangling phases, accumulated in Mølmer--Sørensen and Light-shift gates. We propose methods to actively compensate for these phases, enhance gate robustness against parameter fluctuations, and simplify native gates for more efficient circuit decomposition. Our results pave the way toward the practical and scalable implementation of qudit-based quantum processors.

Abstract: We introduce the prodiabatic elimination, a powerful approximation technique that systematically extends the adiabatic elimination of fast degrees of freedom in light-matter coupled systems. Through a controlled expansion of operators, the prodiabatic elimination incorporates higher-order corrections and consistently includes noise contributions, leading to a significantly improved performance compared to standard adiabatic elimination. Importantly, it retains the simplicity and computational efficiency of the adiabatic elimination, making it convenient for practical applications. We demonstrate the approach on two setups: a driven dissipative Jaynes-Cummings model and a three-level system in a two-mode cavity that performs stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP). These examples establish the prodiabatic elimination as a robust and broadly applicable tool for analyzing open quantum systems.

Abstract: Open quantum systems host mixed-state phases that go beyond the symmetry-protected topological and spontaneous symmetry-breaking paradigms established for closed, pure-state systems. Developing a unified and physically transparent classification of such phases remains a central challenge. In this work, we introduce a purification-based framework that systematically characterizes all mixed-state phases in one-dimensional systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2^σ \times \mathbb{Z}_2^τ$ symmetry. By introducing an ancillary $κ$ chain and employing decorated domain-wall constructions, we derive eight purified fixed-point Hamiltonians labeled by topological indices $(μ_{στ},μ_{τκ},μ_{κσ}) \in \{\pm1\}^3$. Tracing out the ancilla recovers the full structure of mixed-state phases, including symmetric, strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking, average symmetry-protected topological phases, and their nontrivial combinations. Interpolations between the eight fixed points naturally define a three-dimensional phase diagram with a cube geometry. The edges correspond to elementary transitions associated with single topological indices, while the faces host intermediate phases arising from competing domain-wall decorations. Along the edges, we identify a class of critical behavior that connects distinct strong-to-weak symmetry-breaking patterns associated with distinct strong subgroups, highlighting a mechanism unique to mixed-state settings. Large-scale tensor-network simulations reveal a rich phase structure, including pyramid-shaped symmetry-breaking regions and a fully symmetry-broken phase at the cube center. Overall, our purification approach provides a geometrically transparent and physically complete classification of mixed-state phases, unified with a single $\mathbb{Z}_2^σ \times \mathbb{Z}_2^τ \times \mathbb{Z}_2^κ$ model.

Abstract: Quantum state and process tomography are typically analyzed under the assumption that devices emit independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) states or channels. In realistic experiments, however, noise, drift, feedback, or adversarial behavior violate this assumption. We show that projected least-squares tomography remains statistically optimal even under fully adaptive state and channel preparation. Specifically, we prove that the sample complexity for reconstructing the time-averaged state or channel matches the optimal i.i.d. scaling for non-adaptive, single-copy measurements. For rank-$r$ states, the sample complexity is $\mathcal{O}(d r^2/ε^2)$ to achieve accuracy $ε$ in trace distance, while for process tomography it is $\mathcal{O}(d^6/ε^2)$ to achieve accuracy $ε$ in diamond distance. Thus, dropping the i.i.d. assumption does not increase the fundamental sample complexity of quantum tomography, but only changes the interpretation of the reconstructed object.

Abstract: Generative models for quantum data pose significant challenges but hold immense potential in fields such as chemoinformatics and quantum physics. Quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic models (QuDDPMs) enable efficient learning of quantum data distributions by progressively scrambling and denoising quantum states; however, existing implementations typically rely on circuit-based random unitary dynamics that can be costly to realize and sensitive to control imperfections, particularly on analog quantum hardware. We propose the chaotic quantum diffusion model, a framework that generates projected ensembles via chaotic Hamiltonian time evolution, providing a flexible and hardware-compatible diffusion mechanism. Requiring only global, time-independent control, our approach substantially reduces implementation overhead across diverse analog quantum platforms while achieving accuracy comparable to QuDDPMs. This method improves trainability and robustness, broadening the applicability of quantum generative modeling.

Abstract: The stochastic--quantum correspondence reinterprets quantum dynamics as arising from an underlying stochastic process on a configuration space. We generalize the correspondence by lifting an arbitrary stochastic kernel $Γ$ in finite dimension to a map $φ$ on $B(\mathcal H)$, formulating the associated lift-compatibility relation, and giving an explicit dictionary between $Γ$ and CPTP (Kraus) maps. We isolate Chapman--Kolmogorov divisibility of the lifted family as the decisive additional constraint: when a CK-consistent CPTP family exists, the lift admits a Lindblad master equation form. In this picture, off-diagonal (phase) degrees of freedom act as a compressed carrier of history dependence not fixed by transition kernels alone; conversely, the apparent emergence of quantum phase information from a phase-blind stochastic description is explained as a memory effect. Finally, we state and prove a divisibility criterion for the underlying stochastic kernels, expressed as a condition involving divisibility of the lifted map together with a diagonality requirement on the density operator.

Abstract: Quantum communication technologies capable of operating reliably across heterogeneous optical channels are essential for scalable metropolitan quantum networks. Here we demonstrate high-dimensional time-bin-encoded quantum key distribution over a hybrid metropolitan link comprising 1.7 km free-space transmission and 685 m of optical fiber. Operating at a clock rate of 500 MHz in the C-band, we implement both 2- and 4-dimensional protocols, and obtain estimated secure finite-key rates of (95 +- 28) kbit/s for 4D at (25.0 +- 2.0) dB loss and (59 +- 27) kbit/s for 2D at (23.5 +- 2.3) dB loss. Crucially, we achieve continuous operation over 48 h in a fully self-referenced architecture: initial synchronization, interferometric phase stabilization, and long-term drift compensation are performed exclusively using the detected quantum signals, without auxiliary optical reference channels. Our results thus establish a practical and versatile platform for hybrid free-space-to-fiber quantum communication and show that the encoding dimensionality can be adapted to the optimal operating regime of realistic metropolitan channels, providing a pathway toward efficient, autonomous and deployable quantum network nodes.

Abstract: Gauss's law-based quantum error correction (GLQEC) offers a promising approach to reducing qubit overhead in lattice gauge theory simulations by leveraging built-in symmetries. For applications of GLQEC to 1+1D lattice quantum electrodynamics (QED), we identify two significant trade-offs. First, we prove via dimension-counting arguments that GLQEC requires periodic electric fields, thereby constraining the design space for lattice QED simulations. Second, we numerically compare GLQEC with a universal quantum error correction (UQEC) code, specifically the $d=3$ bitflip repetition code, and find that while GLQEC can achieve lower logical error rates in single-round error correction, it exhibits faster decoherence to the steady-state mixed ensemble under multiple rounds. The mixing speed penalty is manifest in observables of interest for both memory experiments and Hamiltonian evolution. We identify a mixing speed threshold, $p_{th}=0.277(2)$, above which using GLQEC exhibits even faster decoherence than without error correction. Our results highlight fundamental limitations of symmetry-based error correction schemes and inform corresponding constraints on formulations of lattice gauge theories compatible with error-robust quantum simulation techniques.

Abstract: Learning properties of quantum states and channels is known to benefit from resources such as entangled operations, auxiliary qubits, and adaptivity, whereas the resource structure of measurement learning, namely, learning properties of quantum measurement operators, remains poorly understood. In this work, we identify a measurement learning task for which access limited to classical measurement outcomes leads to an exponential lower bound on the query complexity, established via a distinguishing task between a genuine quantum projective measurement and a purely classical random number generator. Remarkably, this hardness persists even when arbitrary entangled operations, auxiliary systems, and fully adaptive strategies are allowed, indicating that conventional resources for state and channel learning are ineffective in this task. In contrast, when access to the post-measurement quantum state is available, the same task can be solved with constant query complexity using a simple measuring-twice protocol, without requiring resources that are useful for state and channel learning. Our results reveal post-measurement states as a qualitatively new and decisive resource for measurement learning, suggesting potential implications for the design of practical quantum certification protocols.

Abstract: Power consumption is a critical constraint for CubeSat based quantum communication, where tracking systems often dominate the onboard power budget. We demonstrate an energy-efficient approach that enables reliable satellite tracking at substantially reduced beacon power by treating tracking as a weak-signal estimation task. Using a closed-loop system with fine steering mirrors and higher-order Kalman filters on ground, we can maintain stable tracking at a transmitted power equivalent to 34 mW over a -60 dB satellite to ground optical channel. Our results show that the resulting penalties on QKD bit error rates and signal-to-noise ratios are negligible, allowing for more efficient power allocation to quantum payloads in CubeSat missions.

Abstract: Single-shot fidelity is the standard benchmark for superconducting qubit readout, but it does not directly minimize the total wall-clock time required to certify a quantum state. We formulate an information-theoretic description of dispersive readout that treats the measurement record as a stochastic communication channel and compute the classical Chernoff information governing the multi-shot error exponent using a trajectory model that incorporates T1 relaxation with full cavity memory. We find a consistent separation between the integration time that maximizes single-shot fidelity and the time that minimizes total certification time. For representative transmon parameters and hardware overheads, the throughput-optimal integration window is longer than the fidelity-optimal one, yielding certification speedups of approximately 9-11%, with the gain saturating near 1.13x in the high-readout-power and high-overhead regime. Comparing the extracted classical information to the Gaussian Chernoff limit defines an information-extraction efficiency metric and shows that typical dispersive schemes are limited to about 45% capture at short integration times by detection efficiency, decreasing to approximately 12% at the throughput-optimal integration time of approximately 1.22 us due to T1-induced trajectory smearing. This formulation connects readout calibration directly to the operational objective of minimizing certification time in high-throughput superconducting processors.

Abstract: We develop a simple and systematic route to higher levels of the qubit Clifford hierarchy by coherently controlling Clifford operations. Our approach is based on Pauli periodicity, defined for a Clifford unitary $U$ as the smallest integer $m\ge 1$ such that $U^{2^{m}}$ is a Pauli operator up to phase. We prove a sharp controlled-jump rule showing that the controlled gate $CU$ lies strictly in level $m+2$ of the hierarchy, and equivalently that $CU$ lies in level $k$ if $U^{2^{k-2}}$ is Pauli while no smaller positive power of $U$ is Pauli. We further quantify the resources required to realize large level jumps in the Clifford hierarchy by proving an essentially tight upper bound on Pauli periodicity as a function of the number of qubits, which implies that accessing high hierarchy levels through controlled Cliffords requires a number of target qubits that grows exponentially with the desired level. We complement this limitation with explicit infinite families of Pauli-periodic Cliffords whose controlled versions achieve asymptotically optimal jumps. As an application, we propose a protocol for preparing logical catalyst states that enable logical $Z^{1/2^k}$ phase gates via phase kickback from a single jumped Clifford.

Abstract: High-rate quantum error correcting (QEC) codes encode many logical qubits in a given number of physical qubits, making them promising candidates for quantum computation. Implementing high-rate codes at a scale that both frustrates classical computing and improves performance by encoding requires both high fidelity gates and long-range qubit connectivity -- both of which are offered by trapped-ion quantum computers. Here, we demonstrate computations that outperform their unencoded counterparts in the high-rate $[[ k+2,\, k,\, 2 ]]$ iceberg quantum error detecting (QED) and $[[ (k_2 + 2)(k_1 + 2),\, k_2k_1,\, 4 ]]$ two-level concatenated iceberg QEC codes, using the 98-qubit Quantinuum Helios trapped-ion quantum processor. Utilizing new gadgets for encoded operations, we realize this "beyond break-even" performance with reasonable postselection rates across a range of fault-tolerant (FT) and partially-fault-tolerant (pFT) component and application benchmarks with between $48$ and $94$ logical qubits. These benchmarks include FT state preparation and measurement, QEC cycle benchmarking, logical gate benchmarking, GHZ state preparation, and a pFT quantum simulation of the three-dimensional $XY$ model of quantum magnetism. Additionally, we illustrate that postselection rates can be suppressed by increasing the code distance via concatenation. Our results represent state-of-the-art logical component and state fidelities and provide evidence that high-rate QED/QEC codes are viable on contemporary quantum computers for near-term beyond-classical-scale computation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Efficient long-context LLM deployment is stalled by a dichotomy between amortized compression, which struggles with out-of-distribution generalization, and Test-Time Training, which incurs prohibitive synthetic data costs and requires modifying model weights, creating stateful parameters that complicate concurrent serving. We propose Latent Context Compilation, a framework that fundamentally shifts context processing from adaptation to compilation. By utilizing a disposable LoRA module as a compiler, we distill long contexts into compact buffer tokens -- stateless, portable memory artifacts that are plug-and-play compatible with frozen base models. Crucially, we introduce a self-aligned optimization strategy that eliminates the need for synthetic context-relevant QA pairs. By regularizing context reconstruction task with context-agnostic random queries, we force compressed tokens to reside within the model's existing instruction-following manifold. Experiments with Llama-3.1-8B demonstrate that Latent Context Compilation preserves fine-grained details and reasoning capabilities where prior methods falter, effectively decoupling memory density from model parameters even at a 16x compression ratio.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Operator learning has the potential to strongly impact scientific computing by learning solution operators for differential equations, potentially accelerating multi-query tasks such as design optimization and uncertainty quantification by orders of magnitude. Despite proven universal approximation properties, deep operator networks (DeepONets) often exhibit limited accuracy and generalization in practice, which hinders their adoption. Understanding these limitations is therefore crucial for further advancing the approach.
  This work analyzes performance limitations of the classical DeepONet architecture. It is shown that the approximation error is dominated by the branch network when the internal dimension is sufficiently large, and that the learned trunk basis can often be replaced by classical basis functions without a significant impact on performance.
  To investigate this further, a modified DeepONet is constructed in which the trunk network is replaced by the left singular vectors of the training solution matrix. This modification yields several key insights. First, a spectral bias in the branch network is observed, with coefficients of dominant, low-frequency modes learned more effectively. Second, due to singular-value scaling of the branch coefficients, the overall branch error is dominated by modes with intermediate singular values rather than the smallest ones. Third, using a shared branch network for all mode coefficients, as in the standard architecture, improves generalization of small modes compared to a stacked architecture in which coefficients are computed separately. Finally, strong and detrimental coupling between modes in parameter space is identified.

Abstract: We present ACAR (Adaptive Complexity and Attribution Routing), a measurement framework for studying multi-model orchestration under auditable conditions. ACAR uses self-consistency variance (sigma) computed from N=3 probe samples to route tasks across single-model, two-model, and three-model execution modes. The system is implemented on top of TEAMLLM, a deterministic execution substrate with immutable artifacts and complete decision traces. We evaluate ACAR on 1,510 tasks spanning four benchmarks: MathArena, Reasoning Gym, LiveCodeBench, and SuperGPQA, using Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.0 Flash, producing more than 7,550 auditable runs. Results show that sigma-based routing achieves 55.6 percent accuracy, exceeding the two-model baseline of 54.4 percent while avoiding full ensembling on 54.2 percent of tasks. The routing mechanism is model-agnostic and requires no learned components. We also document negative results. First, retrieval augmentation reduced accuracy by 3.4 percentage points, as median retrieval similarity was only 0.167, demonstrating that experience injection without semantic alignment introduces noise rather than grounding. Second, when models agree on incorrect answers (sigma equals zero), no downstream ensemble can recover; this agreement-but-wrong failure mode is intrinsic to self-consistency and bounds achievable accuracy at approximately eight percentage points below full ensembling. Third, attribution estimates based on proxy signals such as response similarity and entropy showed weak correlation with ground-truth leave-one-out values, indicating that practical attribution requires explicit counterfactual computation. This work documents which assumptions fail in practice and provides falsifiable baselines for future research on routing, retrieval, and multi-model attribution.

Abstract: Urban vibrancy reflects the dynamic human activity within urban spaces and is often measured using mobile data that captures floating population trends. This study proposes a novel approach to derive Urban Vibrancy embeddings from real-time floating population data to enhance traffic prediction models. Specifically, we utilize variational autoencoders (VAE) to compress this data into actionable embeddings, which are then integrated with long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to predict future embeddings. These are subsequently applied in a sequence-to-sequence framework for traffic forecasting. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We use principal component analysis (PCA) to interpret the embeddings, revealing temporal patterns such as weekday versus weekend distinctions and seasonal patterns; (2) We propose a method that combines VAE and LSTM, enabling forecasting dynamic urban knowledge embedding; and (3) Our approach improves accuracy and responsiveness in traffic prediction models, including RNN, DCRNN, GTS, and GMAN. This study demonstrates the potential of Urban Vibrancy embeddings to advance traffic prediction and offer a more nuanced analysis of urban mobility.

Abstract: Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) performs computation directly within resistive crossbar arrays, offering an energy-efficient platform to scale large vision and language models. However, non-ideal analog device properties make the training on AIMC devices challenging. In particular, its update asymmetry can induce a systematic drift of weight updates towards a device-specific symmetric point (SP), which typically does not align with the optimum of the training objective. To mitigate this bias, most existing works assume the SP is known and pre-calibrate it to zero before training by setting the reference point as the SP. Nevertheless, calibrating AIMC devices requires costly pulse updates, and residual calibration error can directly degrade training accuracy. In this work, we present the first theoretical characterization of the pulse complexity of SP calibration and the resulting estimation error. We further propose a dynamic SP estimation method that tracks the SP during model training, and establishes its convergence guarantees. In addition, we develop an enhanced variant based on chopping and filtering techniques from digital signal processing. Numerical experiments demonstrate both the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Active automata learning (AAL) algorithms can learn a behavioral model of a system from interacting with it. The primary challenge remains scaling to larger models, in particular in the presence of many possible inputs to the system. Modern AAL algorithms fail to scale even if, in every state, most inputs lead to errors. In various challenging problems from the literature, these errors are observable, i.e., they emit a known error output. Motivated by these problems, we study learning these systems more efficiently. Further, we consider various degrees of knowledge about which inputs are non-error producing at which state. For each level of knowledge, we provide a matching adaptation of the state-of-the-art AAL algorithm L# to make the most of this domain knowledge. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that the methods accelerate learning by orders of magnitude with strong but realistic domain knowledge to a single order of magnitude with limited domain knowledge.

Abstract: This technical report introduces AngelSlim, a comprehensive and versatile toolkit for large model compression developed by the Tencent Hunyuan team. By consolidating cutting-edge algorithms, including quantization, speculative decoding, token pruning, and distillation. AngelSlim provides a unified pipeline that streamlines the transition from model compression to industrial-scale deployment. To facilitate efficient acceleration, we integrate state-of-the-art FP8 and INT8 Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) algorithms alongside pioneering research in ultra-low-bit regimes, featuring HY-1.8B-int2 as the first industrially viable 2-bit large model. Beyond quantization, we propose a training-aligned speculative decoding framework compatible with multimodal architectures and modern inference engines, achieving 1.8x to 2.0x throughput gains without compromising output correctness. Furthermore, we develop a training-free sparse attention framework that reduces Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) in long-context scenarios by decoupling sparse kernels from model architectures through a hybrid of static patterns and dynamic token selection. For multimodal models, AngelSlim incorporates specialized pruning strategies, namely IDPruner for optimizing vision tokens via Maximal Marginal Relevance and Samp for adaptive audio token merging and pruning. By integrating these compression strategies from low-level implementations, AngelSlim enables algorithm-focused research and tool-assisted deployment.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are essential for performing advanced tasks on edge or mobile devices, yet their deployment is often hindered by severe resource constraints, including limited memory, energy, and computational power. While uniform quantization provides a straightforward approach to compress model and reduce hardware requirement, it fails to fully leverage the varying robustness across layers, and often lead to accuracy degradation or suboptimal resource usage, particularly at low bitwidths. In contrast, heterogeneous quantization, which allocates different bitwidths to individual layers, can mitigate these drawbacks. Nonetheless, current heterogeneous quantization methods either needs huge brute-force design space search or lacks the adaptability to meet different hardware conditions, such as memory size, energy budget, and latency requirement. Filling these gaps, this work introduces \textbf{\textit{SigmaQuant}}, an adaptive layer-wise heterogeneous quantization framework designed to efficiently balance accuracy and resource usage for varied edge environments without exhaustive search.

Abstract: We present Group Orthogonalized Policy Optimization (GOPO), a new alignment algorithm for large language models derived from the geometry of Hilbert function spaces. Instead of optimizing on the probability simplex and inheriting the exponential curvature of Kullback-Leibler divergence, GOPO lifts alignment into the Hilbert space L2(pi_k) of square-integrable functions with respect to the reference policy. Within this space, the simplex constraint reduces to a linear orthogonality condition <v, 1> = 0, defining a codimension-one subspace H0. Minimizing distance to an unconstrained target u_star yields the work-dissipation functional J(v) = <g, v> - (mu / 2) ||v||^2, whose maximizer follows directly from the Hilbert projection theorem. Enforcing the boundary v >= -1 produces a bounded Hilbert projection that induces exact sparsity, assigning zero probability to catastrophically poor actions through a closed-form threshold. To connect this functional theory with practice, GOPO projects from infinite-dimensional L2(pi_k) to a finite empirical subspace induced by group sampling. Because group-normalized advantages sum to zero, the Lagrange multiplier enforcing probability conservation vanishes exactly, reducing the constrained projection to an unconstrained empirical loss. The resulting objective has constant Hessian curvature mu I, non-saturating linear gradients, and an intrinsic dead-zone mechanism without heuristic clipping. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that GOPO achieves competitive generalization while maintaining stable gradient dynamics and entropy preservation in regimes where clipping-based methods plateau.

Abstract: Neural networks are trained by optimizing multi-dimensional sets of fitting parameters on non-convex loss landscapes. Low-loss regions of the landscapes correspond to the parameter sets that perform well on the training data. A key issue in machine learning is the performance of trained neural networks on previously unseen test data. Here, we investigate neural network training by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) - a non-convex global optimization algorithm which relies only on the gradient of the objective function. We contrast SGD solutions with those obtained via a non-stochastic quasi-Newton method, which utilizes curvature information to determine step direction and Golden Section Search to choose step size. We use several computational tools to investigate neural network parameters obtained by these two optimization methods, including kernel Principal Component Analysis and a novel, general-purpose algorithm for finding low-height paths between pairs of points on loss or energy landscapes, FourierPathFinder. We find that the choice of the optimizer profoundly affects the nature of the resulting solutions. SGD solutions tend to be separated by lower barriers than quasi-Newton solutions, even if both sets of solutions are regularized by early stopping to ensure adequate performance on test data. When allowed to fit extensively on the training data, quasi-Newton solutions occupy deeper minima on the loss landscapes that are not reached by SGD. These solutions are less generalizable to the test data however. Overall, SGD explores smooth basins of attraction, while quasi-Newton optimization is capable of finding deeper, more isolated minima that are more spread out in the parameter space. Our findings help understand both the topography of the loss landscapes and the fundamental role of landscape exploration strategies in creating robust, transferrable neural network models.

Abstract: Many emerging agentic paradigms require agents to collaborate with one another (or people) to achieve shared goals. Unfortunately, existing approaches to learning policies for such collaborative problems produce brittle solutions that fail when paired with new partners. We attribute these failures to a combination of free-riding during training and a lack of strategic robustness. To address these problems, we study the concept of strategic risk aversion and interpret it as a principled inductive bias for generalizable cooperation with unseen partners. While strategically risk-averse players are robust to deviations in their partner's behavior by design, we show that, in collaborative games, they also (1) can have better equilibrium outcomes than those at classical game-theoretic concepts like Nash, and (2) exhibit less or no free-riding. Inspired by these insights, we develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm that integrates strategic risk aversion into standard policy optimization methods. Our empirical results across collaborative benchmarks (including an LLM collaboration task) validate our theory and demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves reliable collaboration with heterogeneous and previously unseen partners across collaborative tasks.

Abstract: The standard way to evaluate language models on subjective tasks is through pairwise comparisons: an annotator chooses the "better" of two responses to a prompt. Leaderboards aggregate these comparisons into a single Bradley-Terry (BT) ranking, forcing heterogeneous preferences into a total order and violating basic social-choice desiderata. In contrast, social choice theory provides an alternative approach called maximal lotteries, which aggregates pairwise preferences without imposing any assumptions on their structure. However, we show that maximal lotteries are highly sensitive to preference heterogeneity and can favor models that severely underperform on specific tasks or user subpopulations. We introduce robust lotteries that optimize worst-case performance under plausible shifts in the preference data. On large-scale preference datasets, robust lotteries provide more reliable win rate guarantees across the annotator distribution and recover a stable set of top-performing models. By moving from rankings to pluralistic sets of winners, robust lotteries offer a principled step toward an ecosystem of complementary AI systems that serve the full spectrum of human preferences.

Abstract: Lifetime Value (LTV) prediction is critical in advertising, recommender systems, and e-commerce. In practice, LTV data patterns vary across decision scenarios. As a result, practitioners often build complex, scenario-specific pipelines and iterate over feature processing, objective design, and tuning. This process is expensive and hard to transfer. We propose AgentLTV, an agent-based unified search-and-evolution framework for automated LTV modeling. AgentLTV treats each candidate solution as an {executable pipeline program}. LLM-driven agents generate code, run and repair pipelines, and analyze execution feedback. Two decision agents coordinate a two-stage search. The Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) stage explores a broad space of modeling choices under a fixed budget, guided by the Polynomial Upper Confidence bounds for Trees criterion and a Pareto-aware multi-metric value function. The Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) stage refines the best MCTS program via island-based evolution with crossover, mutation, and migration. Experiments on a large-scale proprietary dataset and a public benchmark show that AgentLTV consistently discovers strong models across ranking and error metrics. Online bucket-level analysis further indicates improved ranking consistency and value calibration, especially for high-value and negative-LTV segments. We summarize practitioner-oriented takeaways: use MCTS for rapid adaptation to new data patterns, use EA for stable refinement, and validate deployment readiness with bucket-level ranking and calibration diagnostics. The proposed AgentLTV has been successfully deployed online.

Abstract: We study the problem of opportunistic approachability: a generalization of Blackwell approachability where the learner would like to obtain stronger guarantees (i.e., approach a smaller set) when their adversary limits themselves to a subset of their possible action space. Bernstein et al. (2014) introduced this problem in 2014 and presented an algorithm that guarantees sublinear approachability rates for opportunistic approachability. However, this algorithm requires the ability to produce calibrated online predictions of the adversary's actions, a problem whose standard implementations require time exponential in the ambient dimension and result in approachability rates that scale as $T^{-O(1/d)}$. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm for opportunistic approachability that achieves a rate of $O(T^{-1/4})$ (and an inefficient one that achieves a rate of $O(T^{-1/3})$), bypassing the need for an online calibration subroutine. Moreover, in the case where the dimension of the adversary's action set is at most two, we show it is possible to obtain the optimal rate of $O(T^{-1/2})$.

Abstract: We study the basic task of mean estimation in the presence of mean-shift contamination. In the mean-shift contamination model, an adversary is allowed to replace a small constant fraction of the clean samples by samples drawn from arbitrarily shifted versions of the base distribution. Prior work characterized the sample complexity of this task for the special cases of the Gaussian and Laplace distributions. Specifically, it was shown that consistent estimation is possible in these cases, a property that is provably impossible in Huber's contamination model. An open question posed in earlier work was to determine the sample complexity of mean estimation in the mean-shift contamination model for general base distributions. In this work, we study and essentially resolve this open question. Specifically, we show that, under mild spectral conditions on the characteristic function of the (potentially multivariate) base distribution, there exists a sample-efficient algorithm that estimates the target mean to any desired accuracy. We complement our upper bound with a qualitatively matching sample complexity lower bound. Our techniques make critical use of Fourier analysis, and in particular introduce the notion of a Fourier witness as an essential ingredient of our upper and lower bounds.

Abstract: Symbolic distillation replaces neural networks, or components thereof, with interpretable, closed-form mathematical expressions. This approach has shown promise in discovering physical laws and mathematical relationships directly from trained deep learning models, yet adoption remains limited due to the engineering barrier of integrating symbolic regression into deep learning workflows. We introduce SymTorch, a library that automates this distillation by wrapping neural network components, collecting their input-output behavior, and approximating them with human-readable equations via PySR. SymTorch handles the engineering challenges that have hindered adoption: GPU-CPU data transfer, input-output caching, model serialization, and seamless switching between neural and symbolic forward passes. We demonstrate SymTorch across diverse architectures including GNNs, PINNs and transformer models. Finally, we present a proof-of-concept for accelerating LLM inference by replacing MLP layers with symbolic surrogates, achieving an 8.3\% throughput improvement with moderate performance degradation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are converging towards a singular Artificial Hivemind, where shared Nature (pre-training priors) result in a profound collapse of distributional diversity, limiting the distinct perspectives necessary for creative exploration and scientific discovery. To address this, we propose to equip models with inference-time Nurture (individualized epistemic trajectories) using Epistemic Evolution paradigm, progressing through explore, internalize, and express. We instantiate this via PRISM (Pluralistic Reasoning via In-context Structure Modeling), a model-agnostic system that augments LLM with dynamic On-the-fly Epistemic Graphs. On three creativity benchmarks, PRISM achieves state-of-the-art novelty and significantly expands distributional diversity. Moreover, we evaluate the real-world utility via a challenging rare-disease diagnosis benchmark. Results demonstrate that PRISM successfully uncovers correct long-tail diagnoses that standard LLM miss, confirming that its divergence stems from meaningful exploration rather than incoherent noise. Overall, this work establishes a new paradigm for Pluralistic AI, moving beyond monolithic consensus toward a diverse ecosystem of unique cognitive individuals capable of collective, multi-perspective discovery.

Abstract: Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) solves complex tasks that require coordination from multiple agents, but is often limited to either local (independent learning) or global (centralized learning) perspectives. In this paper, we introduce a novel sequential training scheme and MARL architecture, which learns from multiple perspectives on different hierarchy levels. We propose the Hierarchical Lead Critic (HLC) - inspired by natural emerging distributions in team structures, where following high-level objectives combines with low-level execution. HLC demonstrates that introducing multiple hierarchies, leveraging local and global perspectives, can lead to improved performance with high sample efficiency and robust policies. Experimental results conducted on cooperative, non-communicative, and partially observable MARL benchmarks demonstrate that HLC outperforms single hierarchy baselines and scales robustly with increasing amounts of agents and difficulty.

Abstract: Differentially private federated learning faces a fundamental tension: privacy protection mechanisms that safeguard client data simultaneously create quantifiable privacy costs that discourage participation, undermining the collaborative training process. Existing incentive mechanisms rely on unbiased client selection, forcing servers to compensate even the most privacy-sensitive clients ("privacy stragglers"), leading to systemic inefficiency and suboptimal resource allocation. We introduce JSAM (Joint client Selection and privacy compensAtion Mechanism), a Bayesian-optimal framework that simultaneously optimizes client selection probabilities and privacy compensation to maximize training effectiveness under budget constraints. Our approach transforms a complex 2N-dimensional optimization problem into an efficient three-dimensional formulation through novel theoretical characterization of optimal selection strategies. We prove that servers should preferentially select privacy-tolerant clients while excluding high-sensitivity participants, and uncover the counter-intuitive insight that clients with minimal privacy sensitivity may incur the highest cumulative costs due to frequent participation. Extensive evaluations on MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that JSAM achieves up to 15% improvement in test accuracy compared to existing unbiased selection mechanisms while maintaining cost efficiency across varying data heterogeneity levels.

Abstract: Accurate and uncertainty-aware trajectory prediction remains a core challenge for autonomous driving, driven by complex multi-agent interactions, diverse scene contexts and the inherently stochastic nature of future motion. Diffusion-based generative models have recently shown strong potential for capturing multimodal futures, yet existing approaches such as cVMD suffer from slow sampling, limited exploitation of generative diversity and brittle scenario encodings.
  This work introduces cVMDx, an enhanced diffusion-based trajectory prediction framework that improves efficiency, robustness and multimodal predictive capability. Through DDIM sampling, cVMDx achieves up to a 100x reduction in inference time, enabling practical multi-sample generation for uncertainty estimation. A fitted Gaussian Mixture Model further provides tractable multimodal predictions from the generated trajectories. In addition, a CVQ-VAE variant is evaluated for scenario encoding. Experiments on the publicly available highD dataset show that cVMDx achieves higher accuracy and significantly improved efficiency over cVMD, enabling fully stochastic, multimodal trajectory prediction.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming the foundation for autonomous agents that can use tools to solve complex tasks. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a common approach for injecting such agentic capabilities, but typically under tightly controlled training setups. It often depends on carefully constructed task-solution pairs and substantial human supervision, which creates a fundamental obstacle to open-ended self-evolution toward superintelligent systems. In this paper, we propose Tool-R0 framework for training general purpose tool-calling agents from scratch with self-play RL, under a zero-data assumption. Initialized from the same base LLM, Tool-R0 co-evolves a Generator and a Solver with complementary rewards: one proposes targeted challenging tasks at the other's competence frontier and the other learns to solve them with real-world tool calls. This creates a self-evolving cycle that requires no pre-existing tasks or datasets. Evaluation on different tool-use benchmarks show that Tool-R0 yields 92.5 relative improvement over the base model and surpasses fully supervised tool-calling baselines under the same setting. Our work further provides empirical insights into self-play LLM agents by analyzing co-evolution, curriculum dynamics, and scaling behavior.

Abstract: Individuals with similar qualifications and skills may vary in their demeanor, or outward manner: some tend toward self-promotion while others are modest to the point of omitting crucial information. Comparing the self-descriptions of equally qualified job-seekers with different self-presentation styles is therefore problematic.
  We build an interactive AI for skill elicitation that provides accurate determination of skills while simultaneously allowing individuals to speak in their own voice. Such a system can be deployed, for example, when a new user joins a professional networking platform, or when matching employees to needs during a company reorganization. To obtain sufficient training data, we train an LLM to act as synthetic humans.
  Elicitation mitigates endogenous bias arising from individuals' own self-reports. To address systematic model bias we enforce a mathematically rigorous notion of equitability ensuring that the covariance between self-presentation manner and skill evaluation error is small.

Abstract: Representing the past in a compressed, efficient, and informative manner is a central problem for systems trained on sequential data. The HiPPO framework, originally proposed by Gu & Dao et al., provides a principled approach to sequential compression by projecting signals onto orthogonal polynomial (OP) bases via structured linear ordinary differential equations. Subsequent works have embedded these dynamics in state space models (SSMs), where HiPPO structure serves as an initialization. Nonlinear successors of these SSM methods such as Mamba are state-of-the-art for many tasks with long-range dependencies, but the mechanisms by which they represent and prioritize history remain largely implicit. In this work, we revisit the HiPPO framework with the goal of making these mechanisms explicit. We show how polynomial representations of history can be extended to support capabilities of modern SSMs such as adaptive allocation of memory and associative memory while retaining direct interpretability in the OP basis. We introduce a unified framework comprising five such extensions, which we collectively refer to as a "HiPPO zoo." Each extension exposes a specific modeling capability through an explicit, interpretable modification of the HiPPO framework. The resulting models adapt their memory online and train in streaming settings with efficient updates. We illustrate the behaviors and modeling advantages of these extensions through a range of synthetic sequence modeling tasks, demonstrating that capabilities typically associated with modern SSMs can be realized through explicit, interpretable polynomial memory structures.

Abstract: Representation learning has been essential for graph machine learning tasks such as link prediction, community detection, and network visualization. Despite recent advances in achieving high performance on these downstream tasks, little progress has been made toward self-explainable models. Understanding the patterns behind predictions is equally important, motivating recent interest in explainable machine learning. In this paper, we present GraphHull, an explainable generative model that represents networks using two levels of convex hulls. At the global level, the vertices of a convex hull are treated as archetypes, each corresponding to a pure community in the network. At the local level, each community is refined by a prototypical hull whose vertices act as representative profiles, capturing community-specific variation. This two-level construction yields clear multi-scale explanations: a node's position relative to global archetypes and its local prototypes directly accounts for its edges. The geometry is well-behaved by design, while local hulls are kept disjoint by construction. To further encourage diversity and stability, we place principled priors, including determinantal point processes, and fit the model under MAP estimation with scalable subsampling. Experiments on real networks demonstrate the ability of GraphHull to recover multi-level community structure and to achieve competitive or superior performance in link prediction and community detection, while naturally providing interpretable predictions.

Abstract: Selecting the right deep learning model for power grid forecasting is challenging, as performance heavily depends on the data available to the operator. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark of five modern neural architectures: two state space models (PowerMamba, S-Mamba), two Transformers (iTransformer, PatchTST), and a traditional LSTM. We evaluate these models on hourly electricity demand across six diverse US power grids for forecast windows between 24 and 168 hours. To ensure a fair comparison, we adapt each model with specialized temporal processing and a modular layer that cleanly integrates weather covariates. Our results reveal that there is no single best model for all situations. When forecasting using only historical load, PatchTST and the state space models provide the highest accuracy. However, when explicit weather data is added to the inputs, the rankings reverse: iTransformer improves its accuracy three times more efficiently than PatchTST. By controlling for model size, we confirm that this advantage stems from the architecture's inherent ability to mix information across different variables. Extending our evaluation to solar generation, wind power, and wholesale prices further demonstrates that model rankings depend on the forecast task: PatchTST excels on highly rhythmic signals like solar, while state space models are better suited for the chaotic fluctuations of wind and price. Ultimately, this benchmark provides grid operators with actionable guidelines for selecting the optimal forecasting architecture based on their specific data environments.

Abstract: Given a black-box AI system and a task, at what confidence level can a practitioner trust the system's output? We answer with a reliability level -- a single number per system-task pair, derived from self-consistency sampling and conformal calibration, that serves as a black-box deployment gate with exact, finite-sample, distribution-free guarantees. Self-consistency sampling reduces uncertainty exponentially; conformal calibration guarantees correctness within 1/(n+1) of the target level, regardless of the system's errors -- made transparently visible through larger answer sets for harder questions. Weaker models earn lower reliability levels (not accuracy -- see Definition 2.4): GPT-4.1 earns 94.6% on GSM8K and 96.8% on TruthfulQA, while GPT-4.1-nano earns 89.8% on GSM8K and 66.5% on MMLU. We validate across five benchmarks, five models from three families, and both synthetic and real data. Conditional coverage on solvable items exceeds 0.93 across all configurations; sequential stopping reduces API costs by around 50%.

Abstract: Flow-based generative models, such as diffusion models and flow matching models, have achieved remarkable success in learning complex data distributions. However, a critical gap remains for their deployment in safety-critical domains: the lack of formal guarantees that generated samples will satisfy hard constraints. We address this by proposing a safety filtering framework that acts as an online shield for any pre-trained generative model. Our key insight is to cooperate with the generative process rather than override it. We define a constricting safety tube that is relaxed at the initial noise distribution and progressively tightens to the target safe set at the final data distribution, mirroring the coarse-to-fine structure of the generative process itself. By characterizing this tube via Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), we synthesize a feedback control input through a convex Quadratic Program (QP) at each sampling step. As the tube is loosest when noise is high and intervention is cheapest in terms of control energy, most constraint enforcement occurs when it least disrupts the model's learned structure. We prove that this mechanism guarantees safe sampling while minimizing the distributional shift from the original model at each sampling step, as quantified by the KL divergence. Our framework applies to any pre-trained flow-based generative scheme requiring no retraining or architectural modifications. We validate the approach across constrained image generation, physically-consistent trajectory sampling, and safe robotic manipulation policies, achieving 100% constraint satisfaction while preserving semantic fidelity.

Abstract: Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is the core computational primitive underlying modern Large Language Models (LLMs). However, MHA suffers from a fundamental linear scaling limitation: $H$ attention heads produce exactly $H$ independent attention matrices, with no communication between heads during attention computation. This becomes problematic for multi-step reasoning, where correct answers depend on aggregating evidence from multiple parts of the context and composing latent token-to-token relations over a chain of intermediate inferences. To address this, we propose Interleaved Head Attention (IHA), which enables cross-head mixing by constructing $P$ pseudo-heads per head (typically $P=H$), where each pseudo query/key/value is a learned linear combination of all $H$ original queries, keys and values respectively. Interactions between pseudo-query and pseudo-key heads induce up to $P^2$ attention patterns per head with modest parameter overhead $\mathcal{O}(H^2P)$. We provide theory showing improved efficiency in terms of number of parameters on the synthetic Polynomial task (IHA uses $Θ(\sqrt{k}n^2)$ parameters vs. $Θ(kn^2)$ for MHA) and on the synthetic order-sensitive CPM-3 task (IHA uses $\lceil\sqrt{N_{\max}}\rceil$ heads vs. $N_{\max}$ for MHA). On real-world benchmarks, IHA improves Multi-Key retrieval on RULER by 10-20% (4k-16k) and, after fine-tuning for reasoning on OpenThoughts, improves GSM8K by 5.8% and MATH-500 by 2.8% (Majority Vote) over full attention.

Abstract: Model merging under unseen test-time distribution shifts often renders naive strategies, such as mean averaging unreliable. This challenge is especially acute in medical imaging, where models are fine-tuned locally at clinics on private data, producing domain-specific models that differ by scanner, protocol, and population. When deployed at an unseen clinical site, test cases arrive in unlabeled, non-i.i.d. batches, and the model must adapt immediately without labels. In this work, we introduce an entropy-adaptive, fully online model-merging method that yields a batch-specific merged model via only forward passes, effectively leveraging target information. We further demonstrate why mean merging is prone to failure and misaligned under heterogeneous domain shifts. Next, we mitigate encoder classifier mismatch by decoupling the encoder and classification head, merging with separate merging coefficients. We extensively evaluate our method with state-of-the-art baselines using two backbones across nine medical and natural-domain generalization image classification datasets, showing consistent gains across standard evaluation and challenging scenarios. These performance gains are achieved while retaining single-model inference at test-time, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Time series causal discovery is essential for understanding dynamic systems, yet many existing methods remain sensitive to noise, non-stationarity, and sampling variability. We propose the Validated Consensus-Driven Framework (VCDF), a simple and method-agnostic layer that improves robustness by evaluating the stability of causal relations across blocked temporal subsets. VCDF requires no modification to base algorithms and can be applied to methods such as VAR-LiNGAM and PCMCI. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that VCDF improves VAR-LiNGAM by approximately 0.08-0.12 in both window and summary F1 scores across diverse data characteristics, with gains most pronounced for moderate-to-long sequences. The framework also benefits from longer sequences, yielding up to 0.18 absolute improvement on time series of length 1000 and above. Evaluations on simulated fMRI data and IT-monitoring scenarios further demonstrate enhanced stability and structural accuracy under realistic noise conditions. VCDF provides an effective reliability layer for time series causal discovery without altering underlying modeling assumptions.

Abstract: We study the problem of efficiently producing, in an online fashion, generative models of scalar, multiclass, and vector-valued outcomes that cannot be falsified on the basis of the observed data and a pre-specified collection of computational tests. Our contributions are twofold. First, we expand on connections between online high-dimensional multicalibration with respect to an RKHS and recent advances in expected variational inequality problems, enabling efficient algorithms for the former. We then apply this algorithmic machinery to the problem of outcome indistinguishability. Our procedure, Defensive Generation, is the first to efficiently produce online outcome indistinguishable generative models of non-Bernoulli outcomes that are unfalsifiable with respect to infinite classes of tests, including those that examine higher-order moments of the generated distributions. Furthermore, our method runs in near-linear time in the number of samples and achieves the optimal, vanishing T^{-1/2} rate for generation error.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple clients without sharing their private data. However, data heterogeneity across clients leads to client drift, which degrades the overall generalization performance of the model. This effect is further compounded by overemphasis on poorly performing clients. To address this problem, we propose FedVG, a novel gradient-based federated aggregation framework that leverages a global validation set to guide the optimization process. Such a global validation set can be established using readily available public datasets, ensuring accessibility and consistency across clients without compromising privacy. In contrast to conventional approaches that prioritize client dataset volume, FedVG assesses the generalization ability of client models by measuring the magnitude of validation gradients across layers. Specifically, we compute layerwise gradient norms to derive a client-specific score that reflects how much each client needs to adjust for improved generalization on the global validation set, thereby enabling more informed and adaptive federated aggregation. Extensive experiments on both natural and medical image benchmarking datasets, across diverse model architectures, demonstrate that FedVG consistently improves performance, particularly in highly heterogeneous settings. Moreover, FedVG is modular and can be seamlessly integrated with various state-of-the-art FL algorithms, often further improving their results. Our code is available at https://github.com/alinadevkota/FedVG.

Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) surrogates are the default tool for emulating expensive computer experiments, but cubic cost, stationarity assumptions, and Gaussian predictive distributions limit their reach. We propose Generative Bayesian Computation (GBC) via Implicit Quantile Networks (IQNs) as a surrogate framework that targets all three limitations. GBC learns the full conditional quantile function from input--output pairs; at test time, a single forward pass per quantile level produces draws from the predictive distribution.
  Across fourteen benchmarks we compare GBC to four GP-based methods. GBC improves CRPS by 11--26\% on piecewise jump-process benchmarks, by 14\% on a ten-dimensional Friedman function, and scales linearly to 90,000 training points where dense-covariance GPs are infeasible. A boundary-augmented variant matches or outperforms Modular Jump GPs on two-dimensional jump datasets (up to 46\% CRPS improvement). In active learning, a randomized-prior IQN ensemble achieves nearly three times lower RMSE than deep GP active learning on Rocket LGBB. Overall, GBC records a favorable point estimate in 12 of 14 comparisons. GPs retain an edge on smooth surfaces where their smoothness prior provides effective regularization.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become the leading paradigm for enhancing reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, standard RLVR algorithms suffer from a well-documented pathology: while they improve Pass@1 accuracy through sharpened sampling, they simultaneously narrow the model's reasoning boundary and reduce generation diversity. We identify a root cause that existing methods overlook: the uniform penalization of errors. Current approaches -- whether data-filtering methods that select prompts by difficulty, or advantage normalization schemes -- treat all incorrect rollouts within a group identically. We show that this uniformity allows overconfident errors (incorrect reasoning paths that the RL process has spuriously reinforced) to persist and monopolize probability mass, ultimately suppressing valid exploratory trajectories. To address this, we propose the Asymmetric Confidence-aware Error Penalty (ACE). ACE introduces a per-rollout confidence shift metric, c_i = log(pi_theta(y_i|x) / pi_ref(y_i|x)), to dynamically modulate negative advantages. Theoretically, we demonstrate that ACE's gradient can be decomposed into the gradient of a selective regularizer restricted to overconfident errors, plus a well-characterized residual that partially moderates the regularizer's strength. We conduct extensive experiments fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Qwen3-8B-Base, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on the DAPO-Math-17K dataset using GRPO and DAPO within the VERL framework. Evaluated on MATH-500 and AIME 2025, ACE composes seamlessly with existing methods and consistently improves the full Pass@k spectrum across all three model families and benchmarks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents under partial observability often condition actions on internally accumulated information such as memory or inferred latent context. We formalise such information-conditioned interaction patterns as behavioural dependency: variation in action selection with respect to internal information under fixed observations. This induces a probe-relative notion of $ε$-behavioural equivalence and a within-policy behavioural distance that quantifies probe sensitivity. We establish three structural results. First, the set of policies exhibiting non-trivial behavioural dependency is not closed under convex aggregation. Second, behavioural distance contracts under convex combination. Third, we prove a sufficient local condition under which gradient ascent on a skewed mixture objective decreases behavioural distance when a dominant-mode gradient aligns with the direction of steepest contraction. Minimal bandit and partially observable gridworld experiments provide controlled witnesses of these mechanisms. In the examined settings, behavioural distance decreases under convex aggregation and under continued optimisation with skewed latent priors, and in these experiments it precedes degradation under latent prior shift. These results identify structural conditions under which probe-conditioned behavioural separation is not preserved under common policy transformations.

Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from a posterior distribution arising in Bayesian inverse problems in science, engineering, and imaging. Our method belongs to the family of independence Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) sampling algorithms, which are common in Bayesian inference. Relying on the existence of an approximate posterior distribution that is cheaper to sample from but may have significant bias, we introduce Proximal-IMH, a scheme that removes this bias by correcting samples from the approximate posterior through an auxiliary optimization problem. This yields a local adjustment that trades off adherence to the exact model against stability around the approximate reference point. For idealized settings, we prove that the proximal correction tightens the match between approximate and exact posteriors, thereby improving acceptance rates and mixing. The method applies to both linear and nonlinear input-output operators and is particularly suitable for inverse problems where exact posterior sampling is too expensive. We present numerical experiments including multimodal and data-driven priors with nonlinear input-output operators. The results show that Proximal-IMH reliably outperforms existing IMH variants.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) deliver detailed responses on vision-language tasks, yet remain susceptible to object hallucination (introducing objects not present in the image), undermining reliability in practice. Prior efforts often rely on heuristic penalties, post-hoc correction, or generic decoding tweaks, which do not directly intervene in the mechanisms that trigger object hallucination and thus yield limited gains. To address this challenge, we propose a causal decoding framework that applies targeted causal interventions during generation to curb spurious object mentions. By reshaping the decoding dynamics to attenuate spurious dependencies, our approach reduces false object tokens while maintaining descriptive quality. Across captioning and QA benchmarks, our framework substantially lowers object-hallucination rates and achieves state-of-the-art faithfulness without degrading overall output quality.

Abstract: The recent field of neural algorithmic reasoning (NAR) studies the ability of graph neural networks (GNNs) to emulate classical algorithms like Bellman-Ford, a phenomenon known as algorithmic alignment. At the same time, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have spawned the study of mechanistic interpretability, which aims to identify granular model components like circuits that perform specific computations. In this work, we introduce Mechanistic Interpretability for Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (MINAR), an efficient circuit discovery toolbox that adapts attribution patching methods from mechanistic interpretability to the GNN setting. We show through two case studies that MINAR recovers faithful neuron-level circuits from GNNs trained on algorithmic tasks. Our study sheds new light on the process of circuit formation and pruning during training, as well as giving new insight into how GNNs trained to perform multiple tasks in parallel reuse circuit components for related tasks.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can be interpreted as discrete-time state-space models, where the state evolution corresponds to an infinite-impulse-response (IIR) filtering operation governed by both feedforward weights and recurrent poles. While, in principle, all parameters including pole locations can be optimized via backpropagation through time (BPTT), such joint learning incurs substantial computational overhead and is often impractical for applications with limited training data. Echo state networks (ESNs) mitigate this limitation by fixing the recurrent dynamics and training only a linear readout, enabling efficient and stable online adaptation. In this work, we analytically and empirically examine why learning recurrent poles does not provide tangible benefits in data-constrained, real-time learning scenarios. Our analysis shows that pole learning renders the weight optimization problem highly non-convex, requiring significantly more training samples and iterations for gradient-based methods to converge to meaningful solutions. Empirically, we observe that for complex-valued data, gradient descent frequently exhibits prolonged plateaus, and advanced optimizers offer limited improvement. In contrast, fixed-pole architectures induce stable and well-conditioned state representations even with limited training data. Numerical results demonstrate that fixed-pole networks achieve superior performance with lower training complexity, making them more suitable for online real-time tasks.

Abstract: We describe extensive numerical experiments assessing and quantifying how classifier performance depends on the quality of the training data, a frequently neglected component of the analysis of classifiers.
  More specifically, in the scientific context of metagenomic assembly of short DNA reads into "contigs," we examine the effects of degrading the quality of the training data by multiple mechanisms, and for four classifiers -- Bayes classifiers, neural nets, partition models and random forests. We investigate both individual behavior and congruence among the classifiers. We find breakdown-like behavior that holds for all four classifiers, as degradation increases and they move from being mostly correct to only coincidentally correct, because they are wrong in the same way. In the process, a picture of spatial heterogeneity emerges: as the training data move farther from analysis data, classifier decisions degenerate, the boundary becomes less dense, and congruence increases.

Abstract: $E(3)$-equivariant neural networks have proven to be effective in a wide range of 3D modeling tasks. A fundamental operation of such networks is the tensor product, which allows interaction between different feature types. Because this operation scales poorly, there has been considerable work towards accelerating this interaction. However, recently \citet{xieprice} have pointed out that most speedups come from a reduction in expressivity rather than true algorithmic improvements on computing Clebsch-Gordan tensor products. A modification of Gaunt tensor product \citep{gaunt} can give a true asymptotic speedup but is incomplete and misses many interactions. In this work, we provide the first complete algorithm which truly provides asymptotic benefits Clebsch-Gordan tensor products. For full CGTP, our algorithm brings runtime complexity from the naive $O(L^6)$ to $O(L^4\log^2 L)$, close to the lower bound of $O(L^4)$. We first show how generalizing fast Fourier based convolution naturally leads to the previously proposed Gaunt tensor product \citep{gaunt}. To remedy antisymmetry issues, we generalize from scalar signals to irrep valued signals, giving us tensor spherical harmonics. We prove a generalized Gaunt formula for the tensor harmonics. Finally, we show that we only need up to vector valued signals to recover the missing interactions of Gaunt tensor product.

Abstract: A key challenge in artificial intelligence and neuroscience is understanding how neural systems learn representations that capture the underlying dynamics of the world. Most world models represent the transition function with unstructured neural networks, limiting interpretability, sample efficiency, and generalization to unseen states or action compositions. We address these issues with a generalizable world model grounded in Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) principles as geometric priors. Our approach utilizes learnable Fourier Holographic Reduced Representation (FHRR) encoders to map states and actions into a high dimensional complex vector space with learned group structure and models transitions with element-wise complex multiplication. We formalize the framework's group theoretic foundation and show how training such structured representations to be approximately invariant enables strong multi-step composition directly in latent space and generalization performances over various experiments. On a discrete grid world environment, our model achieves 87.5% zero shot accuracy to unseen state-action pairs, obtains 53.6% higher accuracy on 20-timestep horizon rollouts, and demonstrates 4x higher robustness to noise relative to an MLP baseline. These results highlight how training to have latent group structure yields generalizable, data-efficient, and interpretable world models, providing a principled pathway toward structured models for real-world planning and reasoning.

Abstract: Data assimilation and scientific inverse problems require reconstructing high-dimensional physical states from sparse and noisy observations, ideally with uncertainty-aware posterior samples that remain faithful to learned priors and governing physics. While training-free conditional generation is well developed for diffusion models, corresponding conditioning and posterior sampling strategies for Flow Matching (FM) priors remain comparatively under-explored, especially on scientific benchmarks where fidelity must be assessed beyond measurement misfit. In this work, we study training-free conditional generation for scientific inverse problems under FM priors and organize existing inference-time strategies by where measurement information is injected: (i) guided transport dynamics that perturb sampling trajectories using likelihood information, and (ii) source-distribution inference that performs posterior inference over the source variable while keeping the learned transport fixed. Building on the latter, we propose D-Flow SGLD, a source-space posterior sampling method that augments differentiable source inference with preconditioned stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, enabling scalable exploration of the source posterior induced by new measurement operators without retraining the prior or modifying the learned FM dynamics. We benchmark representative methods from both families on a hierarchy of problems: 2D toy posteriors, chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky trajectories, and wall-bounded turbulence reconstruction. Across these settings, we quantify trade-offs among measurement assimilation, posterior diversity, and physics/statistics fidelity, and establish D-Flow SGLD as a practical FM-compatible posterior sampler for scientific inverse problems.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as strong alternatives to autoregressive language models, with recent work initializing and fine-tuning a base unimodal model for bimodal generation. Diverging from previous approaches, we introduce the first tri-modal masked diffusion model pretrained from scratch on text, image-text, and audio-text data. We systematically analyze multimodal scaling laws, modality mixing ratios, noise schedules, and batch-size effects, and we provide optimized inference sampling defaults. Our batch-size analysis yields a novel stochastic differential equation (SDE)-based reparameterization that eliminates the need for tuning the optimal batch size as reported in recent work. This reparameterization decouples the physical batch size, often chosen based on compute constraints (GPU saturation, FLOP efficiency, wall-clock time), from the logical batch size, chosen to balance gradient variance during stochastic optimization. Finally, we pretrain a preliminary 3B-parameter tri-modal model on 6.4T tokens, demonstrating the capabilities of a unified design and achieving strong results in text generation, text-to-image tasks, and text-to-speech tasks. Our work represents the largest-scale systematic open study of multimodal discrete diffusion models conducted to date, providing insights into scaling behaviors across multiple modalities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a central post-training paradigm for large language models (LLMs), but its performance is highly sensitive to the quality of training problems. This sensitivity stems from the non-stationarity of RL: rollouts are generated by an evolving policy, and learning is shaped by exploration and reward feedback, unlike supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with fixed trajectories. As a result, prior work often relies on manual curation or simple heuristic filters (e.g., accuracy), which can admit incorrect or low-utility problems. We propose GradAlign, a gradient-aligned data selection method for LLM reinforcement learning that uses a small, trusted validation set to prioritize training problems whose policy gradients align with validation gradients, yielding an adaptive curriculum. We evaluate GradAlign across three challenging data regimes: unreliable reward signals, distribution imbalance, and low-utility training corpus, showing that GradAlign consistently outperforms existing baselines, underscoring the importance of directional gradient signals in navigating non-stationary policy optimization and yielding more stable training and improved final performance. We release our implementation at https://github.com/StigLidu/GradAlign

Abstract: Irregular Multivariate Time Series (IMTS) are characterized by uneven intervals between consecutive timestamps, which carry sampling pattern information valuable and informative for learning temporal and variable dependencies. In addition, IMTS often exhibit diverse dependencies across multiple time scales. However, many existing multi-scale IMTS methods use resampling to obtain the coarse series, which can alter the original timestamps and disrupt the sampling pattern information. To address the challenge, we propose ReIMTS, a Recursive multi-scale modeling approach for Irregular Multivariate Time Series forecasting. Instead of resampling, ReIMTS keeps timestamps unchanged and recursively splits each sample into subsamples with progressively shorter time periods. Based on the original sampling timestamps in these long-to-short subsamples, an irregularity-aware representation fusion mechanism is proposed to capture global-to-local dependencies for accurate forecasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate an average performance improvement of 27.1\% in the forecasting task across different models and real-world datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/Ladbaby/PyOmniTS.

Abstract: Robust watermarking is critical for intellectual property protection, whereas existing methods face a severe vulnerability against regeneration-based AIGC attacks. We identify that existing methods fail because they entangle the watermark with high-frequency cover texture, which is susceptible to being rewritten during generative purification. To address this, we propose WaterVIB, a theoretically grounded framework that reformulates the encoder as an information sieve via the Variational Information Bottleneck. Instead of overfitting to fragile cover details, our approach forces the model to learn a Minimal Sufficient Statistic of the message. This effectively filters out redundant cover nuances prone to generative shifts, retaining only the essential signal invariant to regeneration. We theoretically prove that optimizing this bottleneck is a necessary condition for robustness against distribution-shifting attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WaterVIB significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior zero-shot resilience against unknown diffusion-based editing.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of Muon+ through extensive pre-training experiments across a wide range of model scales and architectures. Our evaluation includes GPT-style models ranging from 130M to 774M parameters and LLaMA-style models ranging from 60M to 1B parameters. We comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of Muon+ in the compute-optimal training regime and further extend the token-to-parameter (T2P) ratio to an industrial level of $\approx 200$. Experimental results show that Muon+ provides a consistent boost on training and validation perplexity over Muon. We provide our code here: https://github.com/K1seki221/MuonPlus.

Abstract: The Flexible Job Shop Problem (FJSP) is a well-studied combinatorial optimization problem with extensive applications for manufacturing and production scheduling. It involves assigning jobs to various machines to optimize criteria, such as minimizing total completion time. Current learning-based methods in this domain often rely on localized feature extraction models, limiting their capacity to capture overarching dependencies spanning operations and machines. This paper introduces an innovative architecture that harnesses Mamba, a state-space model with linear computational complexity, to facilitate comprehensive sequence modeling tailored for FJSP. In contrast to prevalent graph-attention-based frameworks that are computationally intensive for FJSP, we show our model is more efficient. Specifically, the proposed model possesses an encoder and a decoder. The encoder incorporates a dual Mamba block to extract operation and machine features separately. Additionally, we introduce an efficient cross-attention decoder to learn interactive embeddings of operations and machines. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves faster solving speed and surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art learning-based methods for FJSP across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Gene expression prediction, which predicts mRNA expression levels from DNA sequences, presents significant challenges. Previous works often focus on extending input sequence length to locate distal enhancers, which may influence target genes from hundreds of kilobases away. Our work first reveals that for current models, long sequence modeling can decrease performance. Even carefully designed algorithms only mitigate the performance degradation caused by long sequences. Instead, we find that proximal multimodal epigenomic signals near target genes prove more essential. Hence we focus on how to better integrate these signals, which has been overlooked. We find that different signal types serve distinct biological roles, with some directly marking active regulatory elements while others reflect background chromatin patterns that may introduce confounding effects. Simple concatenation may lead models to develop spurious associations with these background patterns. To address this challenge, we propose Prism, a framework that learns multiple combinations of high-dimensional epigenomic features to represent distinct background chromatin states and uses backdoor adjustment to mitigate confounding effects. Our experimental results demonstrate that proper modeling of multimodal epigenomic signals achieves state-of-the-art performance using only short sequences for gene expression prediction.

Abstract: Learning PDE dynamics for fluids increasingly relies on neural operators and Transformer-based models, yet these approaches often lack interpretability and struggle with localized, high-frequency structures while incurring quadratic cost in spatial samples. We propose representing fields with a Gaussian basis, where learned atoms carry explicit geometry (centers, anisotropic scales, weights) and form a compact, mesh-agnostic, directly visualizable state. Building on this representation, we introduce a Gaussian Particle Operator that acts in modal space: learned Gaussian modal windows perform a Petrov-Galerkin measurement, and PG Gaussian Attention enables global cross-scale coupling. This basis-to-basis design is resolution-agnostic and achieves near-linear complexity in N for a fixed modal budget, supporting irregular geometries and seamless 2D-to-3D extension. On standard PDE benchmarks and real datasets, our method attains state-of-the-art competitive accuracy while providing intrinsic interpretability.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) learn to sample diverse candidates in proportion to a reward function, making them well-suited for scientific discovery, where exploring multiple promising solutions is crucial. Further extending GFlowNets to multi-objective settings has attracted growing interest since real-world applications often involve multiple, conflicting objectives. However, existing approaches require additional training for each set of objectives, limiting their applicability and incurring substantial computational overhead. We propose a training-free mixing policy that composes pre-trained GFlowNets at inference time, enabling rapid adaptation without finetuning or retraining. Importantly, our framework is flexible, capable of handling diverse reward combinations ranging from linear scalarization to complex non-linear logical operators, which are often handled separately in previous literature. We prove that our method exactly recovers the target distribution for linear scalarization and quantify the approximation quality for nonlinear operators through a distortion factor. Experiments on a synthetic 2D grid and real-world molecule-generation tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to baselines that require additional training.

Abstract: Many applications seek to optimize LLM outputs at test time by iteratively proposing, scoring, and refining candidates over a discrete output space. Existing methods use a calibrated scalar evaluator for the target objective to guide search, but for many tasks such scores are unavailable, too sparse, or unreliable. Pairwise comparisons, by contrast, are often easier to elicit, still provide useful signal on improvement directions, and can be obtained from the LLM itself without external supervision. Building on this observation, we introduce Duel-Evolve, an evolutionary optimization algorithm that replaces external scalar rewards with pairwise preferences elicited from the same LLM used to generate candidates. Duel-Evolve aggregates these noisy candidate comparisons via a Bayesian Bradley-Terry model, yielding uncertainty-aware estimates of candidate quality. These quality estimates guide allocation of the comparison budget toward plausible optima using Double Thompson Sampling, as well as selection of high-quality parents to generate improved candidates. We evaluate Duel-Evolve on MathBench, where it achieves 20 percentage points higher accuracy over existing methods and baselines, and on LiveCodeBench, where it improves over comparable iterative methods by over 12 percentage points. Notably, the method requires no reward model, no ground-truth labels during search, and no hand-crafted scoring function. Results show that pairwise self-preferences provide strong optimization signal for test-time improvement over large, discrete output spaces.

Abstract: Agent-based epidemic models (ABMs) encode behavioral and policy heterogeneity but are too slow for nightly hospital planning. We develop county-ready surrogates that learn directly from exascale ABM trajectories using Universal Differential Equations (UDEs): mechanistic SEIR-family ODEs with a neural-parameterized contact rate $κ_φ(u,t)$ (no additive residual). Our contributions are threefold: we adapt multiple shooting and an observer-based prediction-error method (PEM) to stabilize identification of neural-augmented epidemiological dynamics across intervention-driven regime shifts; we enforce positivity and mass conservation and show the learned contact-rate parameterization yields a well-posed vector field; and we quantify accuracy, calibration, and compute against ABM ensembles and UDE baselines. On a representative ExaEpi scenario, PEM-UDE reduces mean MSE by 77% relative to single-shooting UDE (3.00 vs. 13.14) and by 20% relative to MS-UDE (3.75). Reliability improves in parallel: empirical coverage of ABM $10$-$90$% and $25$-$75$% bands rises from 0.68/0.43 (UDE) and 0.79/0.55 (MS-UDE) to 0.86/0.61 with PEM-UDE and 0.94/0.69 with MS+PEM-UDE, indicating calibrated uncertainty rather than overconfident fits. Inference runs in seconds on commodity CPUs (20-35 s per $\sim$90-day forecast), enabling nightly ''what-if'' sweeps on a laptop. Relative to a $\sim$100 CPU-hour ABM reference run, this yields $\sim10^{4}\times$ lower wall-clock per scenario. This closes the realism-cadence gap, supports threshold-aware decision-making (e.g., maintaining ICU occupancy $<75$%), preserves mechanistic interpretability, and enables calibrated, risk-aware scenario planning on standard institutional hardware. Beyond epidemics, the ABM$\to$UDE recipe provides a portable path to distill agent-based simulators into fast, trustworthy surrogates for other scientific domains.

Abstract: Generative images have proliferated on Web platforms in social media and online copyright distribution scenarios, and semantic watermarking has increasingly been integrated into diffusion models to support reliable provenance tracking and forgery prevention for web content. Traditional noise-layer-based watermarking, however, remains vulnerable to inversion attacks that can recover embedded signals. To mitigate this, recent content-aware semantic watermarking schemes bind watermark signals to high-level image semantics, constraining local edits that would otherwise disrupt global coherence. Yet, large language models (LLMs) possess structured reasoning capabilities that enable targeted exploration of semantic spaces, allowing locally fine-grained but globally coherent semantic alterations that invalidate such bindings. To expose this overlooked vulnerability, we introduce a Coherence-Preserving Semantic Injection (CSI) attack that leverages LLM-guided semantic manipulation under embedding-space similarity constraints. This alignment enforces visual-semantic consistency while selectively perturbing watermark-relevant semantics, ultimately inducing detector misclassification. Extensive empirical results show that CSI consistently outperforms prevailing attack baselines against content-aware semantic watermarking, revealing a fundamental security weakness of current semantic watermark designs when confronted with LLM-driven semantic perturbations.

Abstract: Neural Graph Databases (NGDBs) facilitate complex logical reasoning over incomplete knowledge structures, yet their training efficiency and expressivity are constrained by rigid query-level batching and structure-exclusive embeddings. We present NGDB-Zoo, a unified framework that resolves these bottlenecks by synergizing operator-level training with semantic augmentation. By decoupling logical operators from query topologies, NGDB-Zoo transforms the training loop into a dynamically scheduled data-flow execution, enabling multi-stream parallelism and achieving a $1.8\times$ - $6.8\times$ throughput compared to baselines. Furthermore, we formalize a decoupled architecture to integrate high-dimensional semantic priors from Pre-trained Text Encoders (PTEs) without triggering I/O stalls or memory overflows. Extensive evaluations on six benchmarks, including massive graphs like ogbl-wikikg2 and ATLAS-Wiki, demonstrate that NGDB-Zoo maintains high GPU utilization across diverse logical patterns and significantly mitigates representation friction in hybrid neuro-symbolic reasoning.

Abstract: High stress occurs when 3D heterogeneous IC packages are subjected to thermal cycling at extreme temperatures. Stress mainly occurs at the interface between different materials. We investigate stress image using latent space representation which is based on using deep generative model (DGM). However, most DGM approaches are unsupervised, meaning they resort to image pairing (input and output) to train DGM. Instead, we rely on a recent boundary-decoder (BD) net, which uses boundary condition and image pairing for stress modeling. The boundary net maps material parameters to the latent space co-shared by its image counterpart. Because such a setup is dimensionally wise ill-posed, we further couple BD net with deep clustering. To access the performance of our proposed method, we simulate an IC chip dataset comprising of 1825 stress images. We compare our new approach using variants of BD net as well as a baseline approach. We show that our approach is able to outperform all the comparison in terms of train and test error reduction.

Abstract: Clinical risk prediction models often underperform in real-world settings due to poor calibration, limited transportability, and subgroup disparities. These challenges are amplified in high-dimensional multimodal cancer datasets characterized by complex feature interactions and a p >> n structure. We present a fully reproducible multimodal machine learning framework for 5-year overall survival prediction in breast cancer, integrating clinical variables with high-dimensional transcriptomic and copy-number alteration (CNA) features from the METABRIC cohort.
  After variance- and sparsity-based filtering and dimensionality reduction, models were trained using stratified train/validation/test splits with validation-based hyperparameter tuning. Two survival approaches were compared: an elastic-net regularized Cox model (CoxNet) and a gradient-boosted survival tree model implemented using XGBoost. CoxNet provides embedded feature selection and stable estimation, whereas XGBoost captures nonlinear effects and higher-order interactions.
  Performance was assessed using time-dependent area under the ROC curve (AUC), average precision (AP), calibration curves, Brier score, and bootstrapped 95 percent confidence intervals. CoxNet achieved validation and test AUCs of 98.3 and 96.6, with AP values of 90.1 and 80.4. XGBoost achieved validation and test AUCs of 98.6 and 92.5, with AP values of 92.5 and 79.9. Fairness diagnostics showed stable discrimination across age groups, estrogen receptor status, molecular subtypes, and menopausal state.
  This work introduces a governance-oriented multimodal survival framework emphasizing calibration, fairness auditing, robustness, and reproducibility for high-dimensional clinical machine learning.

Abstract: Multimodal time series forecasting has garnered significant attention for its potential to provide more accurate predictions than traditional single-modality models by leveraging rich information inherent in other modalities. However, due to fundamental challenges in modality alignment, existing methods often struggle to effectively incorporate multimodal data into predictions, particularly textual information that has a causal influence on time series fluctuations, such as emergency reports and policy announcements. In this paper, we reflect on the role of textual information in numerical forecasting and propose Time series transformers with Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts, TiMi, to unleash the causal reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Concretely, TiMi utilizes LLMs to generate inferences on future developments, which serve as guidance for time series forecasting. To seamlessly integrate both exogenous factors and time series into predictions, we introduce a Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MMoE) module as a lightweight plug-in to empower Transformer-based time series models for multimodal forecasting, eliminating the need for explicit representation-level alignment. Experimentally, our proposed TiMi demonstrates consistent state-of-the-art performance on sixteen real-world multimodal forecasting benchmarks, outperforming advanced baselines while offering both strong adaptability and interpretability.

Abstract: A central challenge in scientific machine learning (ML) is the correct representation of physical systems governed by multi-regime behaviours. In these scenarios, standard data analysis techniques often fail to capture the nature of the data, as the system's response varies significantly across the state space due to its stochasticity and the different physical regimes. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) should thus not be viewed merely as a safety assessment, but as a support to the learning task itself, guiding the model to internalise the behaviour of the data. We address this by focusing on the Critical Heat Flux (CHF) benchmark and dataset presented by the OECD/NEA Expert Group on Reactor Systems Multi-Physics. This case study represents a test for scientific ML due to the non-linear dependence of CHF on the inputs and the existence of distinct microscopic physical regimes. These regimes exhibit diverse statistical profiles, a complexity that requires UQ techniques to internalise the data behaviour and ensure reliable predictions. In this work, we conduct a comparative analysis of UQ methodologies to determine their impact on physical representation. We contrast post-hoc methods, specifically conformal prediction, against end-to-end coverage-oriented pipelines, including (Bayesian) heteroscedastic regression and quality-driven losses. These approaches treat uncertainty not as a final metric, but as an active component of the optimisation process, modelling the prediction and its behaviour simultaneously. We show that while post-hoc methods ensure statistical calibration, coverage-oriented learning effectively reshapes the model's representation to match the complex physical regimes. The result is a model that delivers not only high predictive accuracy but also a physically consistent uncertainty estimation that adapts dynamically to the intrinsic variability of the CHF.

Abstract: Tabular data is the primary data format in industrial relational databases, underpinning modern data analytics and decision-making. However, the increasing scale of tabular data poses significant computational and storage challenges to learning-based analytical systems. This highlights the need for data-efficient learning, which enables effective model training and generalization using substantially fewer samples. Dataset condensation (DC) has emerged as a promising data-centric paradigm that synthesizes small yet informative datasets to preserve data utility while reducing storage and training costs. However, existing DC methods are computationally intensive due to reliance on complex gradient-based optimization. Moreover, they often overlook key characteristics of tabular data, such as heterogeneous features and class imbalance. To address these limitations, we introduce C$^{2}$TC (Class-Adaptive Clustering for Tabular Condensation), the first training-free tabular dataset condensation framework that jointly optimizes class allocation and feature representation, enabling efficient and scalable condensation. Specifically, we reformulate the dataset condensation objective into a novel class-adaptive cluster allocation problem (CCAP), which eliminates costly training and integrates adaptive label allocation to handle class imbalance. To solve the NP-hard CCAP, we develop HFILS, a heuristic local search that alternates between soft allocation and class-wise clustering to efficiently obtain high-quality solutions. Moreover, a hybrid categorical feature encoding (HCFE) is proposed for semantics-preserving clustering of heterogeneous discrete attributes. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that C$^{2}$TC improves efficiency by at least 2 orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art baselines, while achieving superior downstream performance.

Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) have become widely adopted as general-purpose models, demonstrating strong performance in protein engineering and de novo design. Like large language models (LLMs), they are typically trained as deep transformers with next-token or masked-token prediction objectives on massive sequence corpora and are scaled by increasing model depth. Recent work on autoregressive LLMs has identified the Curse of Depth: later layers contribute little to the final output predictions. These findings naturally raise the question of whether a similar depth inefficiency also appears in PLMs, where many widely used models are not autoregressive, and some are multimodal, accepting both protein sequence and structure as input. In this work, we present a depth analysis of six popular PLMs across model families and scales, spanning three training objectives, namely autoregressive, masked, and diffusion, and quantify how layer contributions evolve with depth using a unified set of probing- and perturbation-based measurements. Across all models, we observe consistent depth-dependent patterns that extend prior findings on LLMs: later layers depend less on earlier computations and mainly refine the final output distribution, and these effects are increasingly pronounced in deeper models. Taken together, our results suggest that PLMs exhibit a form of depth inefficiency, motivating future work on more depth-efficient architectures and training methods.

Abstract: Accurately predicting short-term traffic demand is critical for intelligent transportation systems. While deep learning models achieve strong performance under stationary conditions, their accuracy often degrades significantly when faced with distribution shifts caused by external events or evolving urban dynamics. Frequent model retraining to adapt to such changes incurs prohibitive computational costs, especially for large-scale or foundation models. To address this challenge, we propose FORESEE (Forecasting Online with Residual Smoothing and Ensemble Experts), a lightweight online adaptation framework that is accurate, robust, and computationally efficient. FORESEE operates without any parameter updates to the base model. Instead, it corrects today's forecast in each region using yesterday's prediction error, stabilized through exponential smoothing guided by a mixture-of-experts mechanism that adapts to recent error dynamics. Moreover, an adaptive spatiotemporal smoothing component propagates error signals across neighboring regions and time slots, capturing coherent shifts in demand patterns. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets with three backbone models demonstrate that FORESEE consistently improves prediction accuracy, maintains robustness even when distribution shifts are minimal (avoiding performance degradation), and achieves the lowest computational overhead among existing online methods. By enabling real-time adaptation of traffic forecasting models with negligible computational cost, FORESEE paves the way for deploying reliable, up-to-date prediction systems in dynamic urban environments.

Abstract: Alignment and adaptation in large language models heavily rely on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF); yet, theoretical understanding of its generalisability remains premature, especially when the learned reward could shift, and the KL control is estimated and clipped. To address this issue, we develop generalisation theory for RLHF that explicitly accounts for (1) \emph{reward shift}: reward models are trained on preference data from earlier or mixed behaviour policies while RLHF optimises the current policy on its own rollouts; and (2) \emph{clipped KL regularisation}: the KL regulariser is estimated from sampled log-probability ratios and then clipped for stabilisation, resulting in an error to RLHF. We present generalisation bounds for RLHF, suggesting that the generalisation error stems from a sampling error from prompts and rollouts, a reward shift error, and a KL clipping error. We also discuss special cases of (1) initialising RLHF parameters with a uniform prior over a finite space, and (2) training RLHF by stochastic gradient descent, as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The theory yields practical implications in (1) optimal KL clipping threshold, and (2) budget allocation in prompts, rollouts, and preference data.

Abstract: Machine unlearning, which enables a model to forget specific data, is crucial for ensuring data privacy and model reliability. However, its effectiveness can be severely undermined in real-world scenarios where models learn unintended biases from spurious correlations within the data. This paper investigates the unique challenges of unlearning from such biased models. We identify a novel phenomenon we term ``shortcut unlearning," where models exhibit an ``easy to learn, yet hard to forget" tendency. Specifically, models struggle to forget easily-learned, bias-aligned samples; instead of forgetting the class attribute, they unlearn the bias attribute, which can paradoxically improve accuracy on the class intended to be forgotten. To address this, we propose CUPID, a new unlearning framework inspired by the observation that samples with different biases exhibit distinct loss landscape sharpness. Our method first partitions the forget set into causal- and bias-approximated subsets based on sample sharpness, then disentangles model parameters into causal and bias pathways, and finally performs a targeted update by routing refined causal and bias gradients to their respective pathways. Extensive experiments on biased datasets including Waterbirds, BAR, and Biased NICO++ demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art forgetting performance and effectively mitigates the shortcut unlearning problem.

Abstract: We propose Excitation, a novel optimization framework designed to accelerate learning in sparse architectures such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs). Unlike traditional optimizers that treat all parameters uniformly, Excitation dynamically modulates updates using batch-level expert utilization. It introduces a competitive update dynamic that amplifies updates to highly-utilized experts and can selectively suppress low-utilization ones, effectively sharpening routing specialization. Notably, we identify a phenomenon of "structural confusion" in deep MoEs, where standard optimizers fail to establish functional signal paths; Excitation acts as a specialization catalyst, "rescuing" these models and enabling stable training where baselines remain trapped. Excitation is optimizer-, domain-, and model-agnostic, requires minimal integration effort, and introduces neither additional per-parameter optimizer state nor learnable parameters, making it highly viable for memory-constrained settings. Across language and vision tasks, Excitation consistently improves convergence speed and final performance in MoE models, indicating that active update modulation is a key mechanism for effective conditional computation.

Abstract: Effective document intelligence models rely on large amounts of annotated training data. However, procuring sufficient and high-quality data poses significant challenges due to the labor-intensive and costly nature of data acquisition. Additionally, leveraging language models to annotate real documents raises concerns about data privacy. Synthetic document generation has emerged as a promising, privacy-preserving alternative. We propose DocDjinn, a novel framework for controllable synthetic document generation using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that produces annotated documents from unlabeled seed samples. Our approach generates visually plausible and semantically consistent synthetic documents that follow the distribution of an existing source dataset through clustering-based seed selection with parametrized sampling. By enriching documents with realistic diffusion-based handwriting and contextual visual elements via semantic-visual decoupling, we generate diverse, high-quality annotated synthetic documents. We evaluate across eleven benchmarks spanning key information extraction, question answering, document classification, and document layout analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating that VLMs can generate faithful annotated document datasets at scale from unlabeled seeds that can effectively enrich or approximate real, manually annotated data for diverse document understanding tasks. We show that with only 100 real training samples, our framework achieves on average $87\%$ of the performance of the full real-world dataset. We publicly release our code and 140k+ synthetic document samples.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Open-source native GUI agents still lag behind closed-source systems on long-horizon navigation tasks. This gap stems from two limitations: a shortage of high-quality, action-aligned reasoning data, and the direct adoption of generic post-training pipelines that overlook the unique challenges of GUI agents. We identify two fundamental issues in these pipelines: (i) standard SFT with CoT reasoning often hurts grounding, and (ii) step-wise RLVR-tyle training faces partial verifiability, where multiple actions can be correct but only a single demonstrated action is used for verification. This makes offline step-wise metrics weak predictors of online task success. In this work, we present GUI-Libra, a tailored training recipe that addresses these challenges. First, to mitigate the scarcity of action-aligned reasoning data, we introduce a data construction and filtering pipeline and release a curated 81K GUI reasoning dataset. Second, to reconcile reasoning with grounding, we propose action-aware SFT that mixes reasoning-then-action and direct-action data and reweights tokens to emphasize action and grounding. Third, to stabilize RL under partial verifiability, we identify the overlooked importance of KL regularization in RLVR and show that a KL trust region is critical for improving offline-to-online predictability; we further introduce success-adaptive scaling to downweight unreliable negative gradients. Across diverse web and mobile benchmarks, GUI-Libra consistently improves both step-wise accuracy and end-to-end task completion. Our results suggest that carefully designed post-training and data curation can unlock significantly stronger task-solving capabilities without costly online data collection. We release our dataset, code, and models to facilitate further research on data-efficient post-training for reasoning-capable GUI agents.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanation (CE) is an important domain within post-hoc explainability. However, the explanations generated by most CE generators are often highly redundant. This work introduces an open-source Python library xai-cola, which provides an end-to-end pipeline for sparsifying CEs produced by arbitrary generators, reducing superfluous feature changes while preserving their validity. It offers a documented API that takes as input raw tabular data in pandas DataFrame form, a preprocessing object (for standardization and encoding), and a trained scikit-learn or PyTorch model. On this basis, users can either employ the built-in or externally imported CE generators. The library also implements several sparsification policies and includes visualization routines for analysing and comparing sparsified counterfactuals. xai-cola is released under the MIT license and can be installed from PyPI. Empirical experiments indicate that xai-cola produces sparser counterfactuals across several CE generators, reducing the number of modified features by up to 50% in our setting. The source code is available at https://github.com/understanding-ml/COLA.

Abstract: Alleviating catastrophic forgetting while enabling further learning is a primary challenge in continual learning (CL). Orthogonal-based training methods have gained attention for their efficiency and strong theoretical properties, and many existing approaches enforce orthogonality through gradient projection. In this paper, we revisit orthogonality and exploit the fact that small singular values correspond to directions that are nearly orthogonal to the input space of previous tasks. Building on this principle, we introduce NESS (Null-space Estimated from Small Singular values), a CL method that applies orthogonality directly in the weight space rather than through gradient manipulation. Specifically, NESS constructs an approximate null space using the smallest singular values of each layer's input representation and parameterizes task-specific updates via a compact low-rank adaptation (LoRA-style) formulation constrained to this subspace. The subspace basis is fixed to preserve the null-space constraint, and only a single trainable matrix is learned for each task. This design ensures that the resulting updates remain approximately in the null space of previous inputs while enabling adaptation to new tasks. Our theoretical analysis and experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate competitive performance, low forgetting, and stable accuracy across tasks, highlighting the role of small singular values in continual learning. The code is available at https://github.com/pacman-ctm/NESS.

Abstract: Root cause analysis (RCA) in networked industrial systems, such as supply chains and power networks, is notoriously difficult due to unknown and dynamically evolving interdependencies among geographically distributed clients. These clients represent heterogeneous physical processes and industrial assets equipped with sensors that generate large volumes of nonlinear, high-dimensional, and heterogeneous IoT data. Classical RCA methods require partial or full knowledge of the system's dependency graph, which is rarely available in these complex networks. While federated learning (FL) offers a natural framework for decentralized settings, most existing FL methods assume homogeneous feature spaces and retrainable client models. These assumptions are not compatible with our problem setting. Different clients have different data features and often run fixed, proprietary models that cannot be modified. This paper presents a federated cross-client interdependency learning methodology for feature-partitioned, nonlinear time-series data, without requiring access to raw sensor streams or modifying proprietary client models. Each proprietary local client model is augmented with a Machine Learning (ML) model that encodes cross-client interdependencies. These ML models are coordinated via a global server that enforces representation consistency while preserving privacy through calibrated differential privacy noise. RCA is performed using model residuals and anomaly flags. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees and validate our approach on extensive simulations and a real-world industrial cybersecurity dataset.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have been used in many studies to synthesise mixed tabular data. Conditional tabular GAN (CTGAN) have been the most popular variant but struggle to effectively navigate the risk-utility trade-off. Bayesian GAN have received less attention for tabular data, but have been explored with unstructured data such as images and text. The most used technique employed in Bayesian GAN is Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), but it is computationally intensive, particularly in terms of weight storage. In this paper, we introduce Gaussian Approximation of CTGAN (GACTGAN), an integration of the Bayesian posterior approximation technique using Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG) within the CTGAN generator to synthesise tabular data, reducing computational overhead after the training phase. We demonstrate that GACTGAN yields better synthetic data compared to CTGAN, achieving better preservation of tabular structure and inferential statistics with less privacy risk. These results highlight GACTGAN as a simpler, effective implementation of Bayesian tabular synthesis.

Abstract: To reduce carbon emissions and minimize shipping costs, improving the fuel efficiency of ships is crucial. Various measures are taken to reduce the total fuel consumption of ships, including optimizing vessel parameters and selecting routes with the lowest fuel consumption. Different estimation methods are proposed for predicting fuel consumption, while various optimization methods are proposed to minimize fuel oil consumption. This paper provides a comprehensive review of methods for estimating and optimizing fuel oil consumption in maritime transport. Our novel contributions include categorizing fuel oil consumption \& estimation methods into physics-based, machine-learning, and hybrid models, exploring their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of data fusion techniques, which combine AIS, onboard sensors, and meteorological data to enhance accuracy. We make the first attempt to discuss the emerging role of Explainable AI in enhancing model transparency for decision-making. Uniquely, key challenges, including data quality, availability, and the need for real-time optimization, are identified, and future research directions are proposed to address these gaps, with a focus on hybrid models, real-time optimization, and the standardization of datasets.

By updating the topology of the sparse layers between each epoch, we achieve competitive accuracy despite the significantly reduced number of weights. Our primary contribution is a detailed analysis of the robustness of these networks, exploring their performance under various perturbations including random link removal, adversarial attack, and link weight shuffling. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that adaptive topology not only enhances efficiency but also maintains robustness. This work highlights the potential of adaptive sparse networks as a promising direction for developing efficient and reliable deep learning models.

Abstract: Critical applications in areas such as medicine, robotics and autonomous systems require compact (i.e., memory efficient), uncertainty-aware neural networks suitable for edge and other resource-constrained deployments. We study compact spectral circulant and block-circulant-with-circulant-blocks (BCCB) layers: FFT-diagonalizable circular convolutions whose weights live directly in the real FFT (RFFT) half (1D) or half-plane (2D). Parameterizing filters in the frequency domain lets us impose simple spectral structure, perform structured variational inference in a low-dimensional weight space, and calculate exact layer spectral norms, enabling inexpensive global Lipschitz bounds and margin-based robustness diagnostics. By placing independent complex Gaussians on the Hermitian support we obtain a discrete instance of the spectral representation of stationary kernels, inducing an exact stationary Gaussian-process prior over filters on the discrete circle/torus. We exploit this to define a practical spectral prior and a Hermitian-aware low-rank-plus-diagonal variational posterior in real coordinates. Empirically, spectral circulant/BCCB layers are effective compact building blocks in both (variational) Bayesian and point estimate regimes: compact Bayesian neural networks on MNIST->Fashion-MNIST, variational heads on frozen CIFAR-10 features, and deterministic ViT projections on CIFAR-10/Tiny ImageNet; spectral layers match strong baselines while using substantially fewer parameters and with tighter Lipschitz certificates.

Abstract: In recent years, the machine learning community has increasingly embraced the optimal transport (OT) framework for modeling distributional relationships. In this work, we introduce a sample-based neural solver for computing the Wasserstein geodesic between a source and target distribution, along with the associated velocity field. Building on the dynamical formulation of the optimal transport (OT) problem, we recast the constrained optimization as a minimax problem, using deep neural networks to approximate the relevant functions. This approach not only provides the Wasserstein geodesic but also recovers the OT map, enabling direct sampling from the target distribution. By estimating the OT map, we obtain velocity estimates along particle trajectories, which in turn allow us to learn the full velocity field. The framework is flexible and readily extends to general cost functions, including the commonly used quadratic cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on both synthetic and real datasets.

Abstract: Bayesian deep learning (BDL) has emerged as a principled approach to produce reliable uncertainty estimates by integrating deep neural networks with Bayesian inference, and the selection of informative prior distributions remains a significant challenge. Various function-space variational inference (FSVI) regularisation methods have been presented, assigning meaningful priors over model predictions. However, these methods typically rely on a Gaussian prior, which fails to capture the heavy-tailed statistical characteristics inherent in neural network outputs. By contrast, this work proposes a novel function-space empirical Bayes regularisation framework -- termed ST-FS-EB -- which employs heavy-tailed Student's $t$ priors in both parameter and function spaces. Also, we approximate the posterior distribution through variational inference (VI), inducing an evidence lower bound (ELBO) objective based on Monte Carlo (MC) dropout. Furthermore, the proposed method is evaluated against various VI-based BDL baselines, and the results demonstrate its robust performance in in-distribution prediction, out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and handling distribution shifts.

Abstract: Disease progression modeling provides a robust framework to identify long-term disease trajectories from short-term biomarker data. It is a valuable tool to gain a deeper understanding of diseases with a long disease trajectory, such as Alzheimer's disease. A key limitation of most disease progression models is that they are specific to a single data type (e.g., continuous data), thereby limiting their applicability to heterogeneous, real-world datasets. To address this limitation, we propose the Mixed Events model, a novel disease progression model that handles both discrete and continuous data types. This model is implemented within the Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) framework, resulting in Mixed-SuStaIn, enabling subtype and progression modeling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Mixed-SuStaIn through simulation experiments and real-world data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, showing that it performs well on mixed datasets.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of shaft rotational speed, shaft power, and fuel consumption is crucial for enhancing operational efficiency and sustainability in maritime transportation. Conventional physics-based models provide interpretability but struggle with real-world variability, while purely data-driven approaches achieve accuracy at the expense of physical plausibility. This paper introduces a Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (PI-KAN), a hybrid method that integrates interpretable univariate feature transformations with a physics-informed loss function and a leakage-free chained prediction pipeline. Using operational and environmental data from five cargo vessels, PI-KAN consistently outperforms the traditional polynomial method and neural network baselines. The model achieves the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE), and the highest coefficient of determination (R^2) for shaft power and fuel consumption across all vessels, while maintaining physically consistent behavior. Interpretability analysis reveals rediscovery of domain-consistent dependencies, such as cubic-like speed-power relationships and cosine-like wave and wind effects. These results demonstrate that PI-KAN achieves both predictive accuracy and interpretability, offering a robust tool for vessel performance monitoring and decision support in operational settings.

Abstract: Time-series foundation models (TSFMs) have achieved strong univariate forecasting through large-scale pre-training, yet effectively extending this success to multivariate forecasting remains challenging. To address this, we propose DualWeaver, a novel framework that adapts univariate TSFMs (Uni-TSFMs) for multivariate forecasting by using a pair of learnable, structurally symmetric surrogate series. Generated by a shared auxiliary feature-fusion module that captures cross-variable dependencies, these surrogates are mapped to TSFM-compatible series via the forecasting objective. The symmetric structure enables parameter-free reconstruction of final predictions directly from the surrogates, without additional parametric decoding. A theoretically grounded regularization term is further introduced to enhance robustness against adaptation collapse. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets show that DualWeaver outperforms state-of-the-art multivariate forecasters in both accuracy and stability. We release the code at https://github.com/li-jinpeng/DualWeaver.

Hoeffding trees and their variants have a long-standing tradition due to their effectiveness, either alone or as base models in broader ensembles. At the same time a recent line of work in batch learning has shown that kernel density estimation (KDE) is an effective approach for smoothed predictions in imbalanced regression tasks [Yang et al., 2021]. Moreover, another recent line of work for batch learning, called hierarchical shrinkage (HS) [Agarwal et al., 2022], has introduced a post-hoc regularization method for decision trees that does not alter the structure of the learned tree. Using a telescoping argument we cast KDE to streaming environments and extend the implementation of HS to incremental decision tree models. Armed with these extensions we investigate the performance of decision trees that may enjoy such options in datasets commonly used for regression in online settings. We conclude that KDE is beneficial in the early parts of the stream, while HS hardly, if ever, offers performance benefits.

Abstract: Despite the extensive literature on training loss functions, the evaluation of generalization on the validation set remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical and statistical study of how the validation criterion used for model selection affects test performance in neural classifiers, with attention to early stopping. Using fully connected networks on standard benchmarks under $k$-fold evaluation, we compare: (i) early stopping with patience and (ii) post-hoc selection over all epochs (i.e. no early stopping). Models are trained with cross-entropy, C-Loss, or PolyLoss; the model parameter selection on the validation set is made using accuracy or one of the three loss functions, each considered independently. Three main findings emerge. (1) Early stopping based on validation accuracy performs worst, consistently selecting checkpoints with lower test accuracy than both loss-based early stopping and post-hoc selection. (2) Loss-based validation criteria yield comparable and more stable test accuracy. (3) Across datasets and folds, any single validation rule often underperforms the test-optimal checkpoint. Overall, the selected model typically achieves test-set performance statistically lower than the best performance across all epochs, regardless of the validation criterion. Our results suggest avoiding validation accuracy (in particular with early stopping) for parameter selection, favoring loss-based validation criteria.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) plays a significant role in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. While RLHF with expected reward constraints can be formulated as a primal-dual optimization problem, standard primal-dual methods only guarantee convergence with a distributional policy where the saddle-point problem is in convex-concave form. Moreover, standard primal-dual methods may exhibit instability or divergence in the last iterate under policy parameterization in practical applications. In this work, we propose a universal primal-dual framework for safe RLHF that unifies a broad class of existing alignment algorithms, including safe-RLHF, one-shot, and multi-shot based methods. Building on this framework, we introduce an optimistic primal-dual (OPD) algorithm that incorporates predictive updates for both primal and dual variables to stabilize saddle-point dynamics. We establish last-iterate convergence guarantees for the proposed method, covering both exact policy optimization in the distributional space and convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal solution whose gap is related to approximation error and bias under parameterized policies. Our analysis reveals that optimism plays a crucial role in mitigating oscillations inherent to constrained alignment objectives, thereby closing a key theoretical gap between constrained RL and practical RLHF.

Abstract: In many applications, it is important to identify subpopulations that survive longer or shorter than the rest of the population. In medicine, for example, it allows determining which patients benefit from treatment, and in predictive maintenance, which components are more likely to fail. Existing methods for discovering subgroups with exceptional survival characteristics require restrictive assumptions about the survival model (e.g. proportional hazards), pre-discretized features, and, as they compare average statistics, tend to overlook individual deviations. In this paper, we propose Sysurv, a fully differentiable, non-parametric method that leverages random survival forests to learn individual survival curves, automatically learns conditions and how to combine these into inherently interpretable rules, so as to select subgroups with exceptional survival characteristics. Empirical evaluation on a wide range of datasets and settings, including a case study on cancer data, shows that Sysurv reveals insightful and actionable survival subgroups.

Abstract: Modelling rock-fluid interaction requires solving a set of partial differential equations (PDEs) to predict the flow behaviour and the reactions of the fluid with the rock on the interfaces. Conventional high-fidelity numerical models require a high resolution to obtain reliable results, resulting in huge computational expense. This restricts the applicability of these models for multi-query problems, such as uncertainty quantification and optimisation, which require running numerous scenarios. As a cheaper alternative to high-fidelity models, this work develops eight surrogate models for predicting the fluid flow in porous media. Four of these are reduced-order models (ROM) based on one neural network for compression and another for prediction. The other four are single neural networks with the property of grid-size invariance; a term which we use to refer to image-to-image models that are capable of inferring on computational domains that are larger than those used during training. In addition to the novel grid-size-invariant framework for surrogate models, we compare the predictive performance of UNet and UNet++ architectures, and demonstrate that UNet++ outperforms UNet for surrogate models. Furthermore, we show that the grid-size-invariant approach is a reliable way to reduce memory consumption during training, resulting in good correlation between predicted and ground-truth values and outperforming the ROMs analysed. The application analysed is particularly challenging because fluid-induced rock dissolution results in a non-static solid field and, consequently, it cannot be used to help in adjustments of the future prediction.

Abstract: This paper establishes and proves representation theorems for cumulative propositional dependence logic and for cumulative propositional logic with team semantics. Cumulative logics are famously given by System C. For propositional dependence logic, we show that System C entailments are exactly captured by cumulative models from Kraus, Lehmann and Magidor. On the other hand, we show that entailment in cumulative propositional logics with team semantics is exactly captured by cumulative and asymmetric models. For the latter, we also obtain equivalence with cumulative logics based on propositional logic with classical semantics. The proofs will be useful for proving representation theorems for other cumulative logics without negation and material implication.

Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) are pervasive across various domains but often lack interpretability. To address the growing need for explanations, logic-based approaches have been proposed to explain predictions made by NNs, offering correctness guarantees. However, scalability remains a concern in these methods. This paper proposes an approach leveraging domain slicing to facilitate explanation generation for NNs. By reducing the complexity of logical constraints through slicing, we decrease explanation time by up to 40\% less time, as indicated through comparative experiments. Our findings highlight the efficacy of domain slicing in enhancing explanation efficiency for NNs.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains one of the leading global health challenges, accounting for more than 19 million deaths worldwide. To address this, several tools that aim to predict CVD risk and support clinical decision making have been developed. In particular, the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) is one of the most widely used and recommended worldwide. However, it does not explain why a patient was assigned to a particular risk category nor how it can be reduced. Due to this lack of transparency, we present a logical explainer for the FRS. Based on first-order logic and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) fundaments, the explainer is capable of identifying a minimal set of patient attributes that are sufficient to explain a given risk classification. Our explainer also produces actionable scenarios that illustrate which modifiable variables would reduce a patient's risk category. We evaluated all possible input combinations of the FRS (over 22,000 samples) and tested them with our explainer, successfully identifying important risk factors and suggesting focused interventions for each case. The results may improve clinician trust and facilitate a wider implementation of CVD risk assessment by converting opaque scores into transparent and prescriptive insights, particularly in areas with restricted access to specialists.

Abstract: The optimization of complex medical appointment scheduling remains a significant operational challenge in multi-center healthcare environments, where clinical safety protocols and patient logistics must be reconciled. This study proposes and evaluates a Genetic Algorithm (GA) framework designed to automate the scheduling of multiple medical acts while adhering to rigorous inter-procedural incompatibility rules. Using a synthetic dataset encompassing 50 medical acts across four healthcare facilities, we compared two GA variants, Pre-Ordered and Unordered, against deterministic First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) and Random Choice baselines. Our results demonstrate that the GA framework achieved a 100% constraint fulfillment rate, effectively resolving temporal overlaps and clinical incompatibilities that the FCFS baseline failed to address in 60% and 40% of cases, respectively. Furthermore, the GA variants demonstrated statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001) in patient-centric metrics, achieving an Idle Time Ratio (ITR) frequently below 0.4 and reducing inter-healthcenter trips. While the GA (Ordered) variant provided a superior initial search locus, both evolutionary models converged to comparable global optima by the 100th generation. These findings suggest that transitioning from manual, human-mediated scheduling to an automated metaheuristic approach enhances clinical integrity, reduces administrative overhead, and significantly improves the patient experience by minimizing wait times and logistical burdens.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Most contemporary neural learning systems rely on epoch-based optimization and repeated access to historical data, implicitly assuming reversible computation. In contrast, real-world environments often present information as irreversible streams, where inputs cannot be replayed or revisited. Under such conditions, conventional architectures degrade into reactive filters lacking long-horizon coherence. This paper introduces Stream Neural Networks (StNN), an execution paradigm designed for irreversible input streams. StNN operates through a stream-native execution algorithm, the Stream Network Algorithm (SNA), whose fundamental unit is the stream neuron. Each stream neuron maintains a persistent temporal state that evolves continuously across inputs. We formally establish three structural guarantees: (1) stateless mappings collapse under irreversibility and cannot encode temporal dependencies; (2) persistent state dynamics remain bounded under mild activation constraints; and (3) the state transition operator is contractive for λ < 1, ensuring stable long-horizon execution. Empirical phase-space analysis and continuous tracking experiments validate these theoretical results. The execution principles introduced in this work define a minimal substrate for neural computation under irreversible streaming constraints.

Abstract: Most microscopic descriptions of structural dynamics assume the Born-Oppenheimer separation, where electrons adjust adiabatically to ionic motion. When this separation breaks down, electronic and lattice degrees of freedom can evolve on different timescales, giving rise to new physical phenomena beyond the adiabatic limit. Here we use time-resolved, phase-sensitive second-harmonic generation and pump-probe reflectivity to reshape the ferroelectric free-energy landscape of SnTe while separately tracking polar order and coherent lattice motion. When photoexcitation transiently suppresses the double-well barrier, polarization dynamics become strongly nonlinear, while the coherent phonon dynamics remain harmonic. This decoupling cannot be described by a single adiabatic coordinate for the electronic polarization and ionic positions. We provide a unifying physical description for the non adiabatic dynamics of the ferroelectric mode and the mixed displacive/order-disorder nature of SnTe based on a separation of scales for the renormalization of the ferroelectric stiffness.

Abstract: Interpreting spectroscopy data is a critical bottleneck in automating chemical research and industrial characterization. Particularly within infrared (IR) spectroscopy, identifying compounds in complex, liquid-phase chemical mixtures largely relies on expert knowledge, as variable peak assignment, broadening, and shifts hinder data-driven methods. Here, we show that an algorithmic approach can identify components in both simulated and experimental mixture spectra with high accuracy despite nonlinearities in liquid-phase IR data. The method is comprehensively benchmarked with a dataset of over 44,000 simulated liquid-phase IR spectra for mixtures and achieves up to 90% accuracy in identifying molecular components across a dataset of binary and ternary liquid mixtures. Our strategy is robust to perturbation of spectra, and its accuracy is capped by near-identical liquid-phase IR spectra that limit the resolution of chemical identification, imposing theoretical limits on achieving perfect accuracy in structure identification. Finally, we apply the method to automatically interpret IR spectra in experimental settings, correctly identifying the components of nearly all samples within a blind study. This work provides tools and data to advance automated chemical laboratories through algorithmic interpretation of liquid-phase IR spectra of mixtures.

This salt exhibits characteristic transport properties, including large positive in-plane and anomalous negative interlayer magnetoresistance. These signatures closely resemble the high-pressure DE states of $α$-(ET)$_2$I$_3$ (ET = bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene). First-principles calculations including spin-orbit coupling identify the electronic state as a quasi-three-dimensional massive Dirac semimetal with residual Fermi pockets. This discovery provides a valuable platform for exploring bulk Dirac fermions without the complexity of high-pressure measurements.

Abstract: Nanofluidic ionic transistors typically require gate voltages above 1 V and operate only at sub millimolar ionic strengths, limiting their biocompatible applications. We demonstrate ionic transistors consisting of single sub 10 nm nanopores drilled in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures with internal gate electrodes made of few layer graphene. These devices deliver up to 10fold current modulation at gate voltages as low as 0.3 V in 10 mM KCl, and 2fold modulation at near physiological 100 mM KCl. Baseline conductance with no gate shows surface charge dominated transport below 100 mM KCl consistent with negatively charged hBN walls and 5 nm opening of the pores. The surface charge and the electrochemical asymmetry introduced by the three electrode configuration govern the device behavior: negative gate voltage (VG) enriches ionic concentrations and enhances current, whereas positive VG induces a local depletion zone that suppresses transport. The current modulation by VG is dependent on the polarity of the transmembrane potential and leads to ion current rectification. Molecular dynamics simulations of a nanopore in a hBN graphene hBN stack reveal confinement and surface charge dependent suppression of relative permittivity of interfacial water. Continuum modeling with radially varying interfacial water permittivity reproduces the asymmetric IV characteristics and explains how the embedded gate sculpts local potential and ion concentrations. By enabling sub 0.5 V control of ionic transport at up to 100 mM salt concentrations, these devices address a key barrier in nanofluidics and open the pathway to low power ionic circuits and biosensing.

Abstract: A large challenge in determining the physics of helimagnetic SrFeO3 is in stabilizing the stoichiometric chemical phase over long enough time scales to conduct extensive measurements. Degradation in SrFeO3 manifests mainly as a crossover from metallic to insulating behavior. Using a combination of electronic transport and density functional theory, we show that this degradation is dominated by oxygen loss, possibly on the order of one percent. We further demonstrate that high quality SrFeO3 thin films can be stabilized long-term by combining a nanoscale band insulator capping layer with an ex situ ozone anneal. We show that this produces a nearly-pristine cation sublattice and preserves metallicity for at least several weeks. These results establish a reliable pathway for producing chemically stable SrFeO3 thin films, enabling reproducible studies of its unusual helimagnetism.

Abstract: Altermagnets offer a unique pathway to functional spintronics by combining vanishing magnetization with large spin splitting. Here, we demonstrate that the canonical d-wave altermagnet KV2Se2O can deliver giant tunneling magnetoresistance through orientation-dependent spin filtering. By analyzing the crystallographic spin segregation, we show that transport along specific crystallographic axes is nearly fully spin-polarized within the symmetry-protected ballistic channels. We implement this mechanism in a lattice-matched KV2Se2O/Bi2O2Se/KV2Se2O magnetic tunnel junction, which achieves a robust half-metallic transport regime. The symmetry-protected spectral gap in the parallel/anti-parallel configuration ensures a high tunneling magnetoresistance ratio, resulting in substantial tunneling magnetoresistance, robust thermally driven spin filtering, and spin Seebeck effect at room temperature. These findings provide a path of altermagnetic heterostructures as a high-performance platform for scalable, field-free, and thermally stable spin logic.

Abstract: Oxygen transport membranes (OTMs), enabling catalytic reaction and gas separation, support crucial chemical engineering processes and decarbonization technologies, but their applications are hindered by limited oxygen permeation fluxes and inadequate long-term stability during operation. Here, a series of high-entropy perovskite OTMs based on La0.5Sr0.5CoO3 were designed and synthesized by the simple sol-gel method. The impact of varying doping ratios on the structure, surface morphology, oxygen permeability, and stability of these high-entropy OTMs was thoroughly examined. At 950 °C, the optimal composition, La0.25Sr0.25Gd0.2Nd0.2Pr0.1CoO3, achieved oxygen permeation fluxes of 1.62 mL min-1 cm-2 under air/He gradient and 1.46 mL min-1 cm-2 under air/CO2, respectively. Remarkably, all high-entropy OTMs demonstrated stable operation for over 100 h in a pure CO2 environment without a significant decline in performance. This finding paves a new way to enhance the structural and oxygen permeation stability of OTMs, and further promotes the application of OTMs in oxy-fuel combustion technologies aimed at improving CO2 capture and storage efficiency.

Abstract: Solid-state refrigeration technologies, represented by electrocaloric effect (ECE), are renowned for zero global-warming-potential and high cooling efficiency. Synergistically achieving high electrocaloric effect (ΔT) and wide temperature span (ΔTspan) for EC materials takes a leapfrog toward practical cooling applications, typical for integrated circuits. Guided by phase-field simulation, Ba(Ti, Hf)O3 dubbed as a polar wrench, establishes polar frustration by setting up local stress field and manipulating octahedral oxygen tilt (OOT) in NaNbO3-based relaxor. The resultant P4bm framework entails short-range and highly-polar ferrodistortive nanodomains, i.e., the abundant highly-polar nanodomains facilitate to increase entropy change and robust OOT enables to impede thermal perturbations. Consequently, a large ΔT of 0.85 K and 0.70 K with an ultrawide ΔTspan of 118 K and 130 K is obtained, contributing to an ultrahigh figure of merit of > 90 K2 in NaNbO3-Ba(Ti, Hf)O3, significantly outperforms its counterparts. The local structure responsible for robust EC performances are decrypted through 2D information from atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscope, 3D big-box model constructed from neutron total scattering and DFT calculations. These findings highlight that polar frustration strategy in ferrodistortive relaxor enables to pioneer emergent EC performances, and also unearth potential entropy-change-based ferroelectric and ferromagnetic materials beyond.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly applied beyond natural language processing, demonstrating strong capabilities in complex scientific tasks that traditionally require human expertise. This progress has extended into materials discovery, where LLMs introduce a new paradigm by leveraging reasoning and in-context learning, capabilities absent from conventional machine learning approaches. Here, we present a Multi-Agent-based Electrocatalyst Search Through Reasoning and Optimization (MAESTRO) framework in which multiple LLMs with specialized roles collaboratively discover high-performance single atom catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction. Within an autonomous design loop, agents iteratively reason, propose modifications, reflect on results and accumulate design history. Through in-context learning enabled by this iterative process, MAESTRO identified design principles not explicitly encoded in the LLMs' background knowledge and successfully discovered catalysts that break conventional scaling relations between reaction intermediates. These results highlight the potential of multi-agent LLM frameworks as a powerful strategy to generate chemical insight and discover promising catalysts.

Abstract: Patterned two-dimensional (2D) magnetic nanostructures constitute geometry-engineered spin systems in which exchange, anisotropy, dipolar coupling, and finite-size effects operate on comparable energy scales. Spatial modulation of continuous magnetic films produces confinement-driven critical behavior, compensation phenomena, metastable switching pathways, and topologically non-trivial textures such as vortices and skyrmions. Computational modeling plays a central role in resolving this complexity, enabling quantitative construction of thermodynamic phase diagrams and analysis of geometry-dependent stability regimes. This review synthesizes theoretical and numerical frameworks for patterned 2D magnetism, including classical spin models, stochastic spin dynamics, rare-event methods, and multiscale parameterization informed by first-principles calculations. Representative systems-nanodot and antidot arrays, artificial spin-ice lattices, exchange-modulated heterostructures, and patterned van der Waals magnets- illustrate how geometry functions as an effective thermodynamic control parameter. Emerging directions in nonequilibrium modeling, multiphysics coupling, and scalable data-centric workflows are discussed in the context of predictive phase mapping. Patterned 2D magnetism thus exemplifies the convergence of geometry-controlled materials engineering and computational statistical physics, with phase stability and controlled spin textures at the core of next-generation spintronic architectures.

Abstract: Nonlinear Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy is a nonlinear ultrasonic technique which allows monitoring small variations in the microstructure of a medium and thus allows materials characterization and monitoring of damage evolution. Application of the technique to monitor Liquid Metal Embrittlement induced by gallium penetration in aluminum is presented here. To define indicators of material degradation, data treatment using the Singular Value Decomposition approach is introduced and discussed. Experimental results show that nonlinear properties are correlated with the state of the liquid metal in the solid matrix, allowing to identify different phases in the process of gallium diffusion along grain boundaries and within the bulk of individual grains. Furthermore, the evolution of gallium damage allows to study correlations between nonlinear, fast and slow dynamic properties.

Abstract: Chemical bonding governs how atoms interact to form compounds, thereby determining their physicochemical properties. Despite being an elusive concept, chemical bonding has led to the development of models and tools to explain and predict the behavior of chemical species. This perspective addresses the adoption of chemical bonding analysis to the study of optoelectronic materials, emphasizing the im-portance of its predictive aspect. After reviewing the evolution of chemical bonding models from the first Lewis formulation to the present day, the perspective discusses material classes and chemical bonding phenomena most relevant for light harvesting and emission. We delve into metal halide perovskites and structurally related materials, given their central role in optoelectronic research. Various aspects of chemical bonding in these materials are surveyed, from the structure-property relationship to the rationalization of their electronic properties through molecular orbital diagrams. Two chemical bonding features are particularly important for optoelectronic materials: the ns2 lone pairs of the cations typically found in these materials (e.g. Pb, Sb, Bi) and the antibonding nature of valence and/or conduction bands. We discuss in depth the models to predict the implications of these two phenomena on optoelectronic properties. We also explore chalcohal-ides, a class of materials whose optoelectronic properties are recently emerging. From the chemical bonding perspective, these materials display intriguing phenomena due to the interplay of various types of chemical bonds. Finally, we discuss our vision on the role of chemical bonding analysis in the future of materials science, including synergies and antitheses with machine learning.

Abstract: The nonlinearity of magnetization precession and spin waves is a cornerstone of contemporary magnonics. We investigate nonlinear magnetization dynamics in a thin epitaxial iron film driven by femtosecond laser pulses in regimes of homogeneous precession and propagating magnetostatic spin wave packets. The magnetization precession anharmonicity, the generation of higher-order harmonics, and the dynamical rectification are experimentally demonstrated. The numerical solution of the non-linearized Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation reveals that these effects stem from the asymmetry in the energy potential. This asymmetry is readily achievable when an external magnetic field with a strength comparable to the magnetic anisotropy field is applied close to the hard axis. This work establishes a connection between the geometry of the energy profile and nonlinear responses, paving the way for designing magnonic devices with controlled harmonic generation and nonlinear spin wave interaction.

Abstract: Chalcogenide perovskites have emerged as promising absorber materials for next-generation photovoltaic devices, yet their experimental realization remains limited by competing phases, structural polymorphism, and synthetic challenges. Here, we present a fully data-driven and experimentally grounded screening and ranking framework to assess the stability and experimental feasibility of chalcogenide perovskites, integrating interpretable analytical descriptors, machine-learning models, and sustainability metrics. Using a curated experimental dataset of halide and chalcogenide compounds, we derive a new tolerance factor via the SISSO (sure independence screening and sparsifying operator) algorithm that more accurately distinguishes perovskite-forming compositions than established tolerance-factor-based screening criteria. This descriptor is combined with generative crystal structure prediction, composition-based bandgap estimation, and machine-learning-based feasibility assessment to systematically explore a wide chemical space of hypothetical chalcogenide perovskites. The resulting candidates are further evaluated using sustainability indicators, enabling multi-objective ranking tailored to both single-junction and tandem photovoltaic architectures. Beyond identifying several promising and previously unexplored chalcogenide perovskites, this work demonstrates a transferable screening strategy for chemically constrained materials spaces that balances optoelectronic performance, experimental viability, and long-term sustainability.

Abstract: We investigate the interplay between relativistic spin-momentum locking arising from altermagnetism and various forms of inversion symmetry breaking. Depending on the symmetry breaking, this can give rise to Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling (SOC), Weyl-type SOC, or the coexistence of two distinct spin-momentum lockings. We focus on the altermagnetic Ca2RuO4 as a testbed material. Our results reproduce the experimentally observed ground state, which is an A-centered magnetic order with the Neel vector along the b-axis, hosting spin cantings along the a- and c-axes but without weak ferromagnetism. Ca2RuO4 exhibits relativistic spin-momentum locking, with different even-parity wave orders for the three spin components. We interpret the experimental results on doped samples as evidence for a transition from a pure altermagnetic phase to a weak ferromagnetic phase. Under ferroelectric- and antiferroelectric-like distortions, there are no qualitative changes in the non-relativistic spin-momentum locking and in the weak ferromagnetism. However, we observe the rise of the Rashba or Weyl-type SOC. Using numerical and analytical models, we investigate which nodal planes persist when inversion symmetry is broken in the relativistic case. The spin-momentum locking of the other components adopt a p-wave character in the case of Rashba; in contrast, Weyl-type SOC disrupts all nodal planes, leaving only nodal lines. Finally, to simulate a stripe phase with structural distortions along the z-axis, we studied a modulated electric field inducing atomic displacements within one Ca2RuO4 layer. This produces a magnetic phase transition to an exotic altermagnetic state with two non-relativistic spin-momentum lockings hosting weak ferromagnetism. Our research presents a comprehensive analysis of various possible scenarios in altermagnets with breaking of inversion symmetries under relativistic effects

Abstract: We present an analytically solvable minimal model for the relaxation of low-frequency magnons in magnetic insulators arising from magnon-phonon and magnon-magnon interactions. The model establishes a direct connection between microscopic relaxation processes and Gilbert damping, and reveals how magnon decay evolves from bulk systems to the monolayer limit. We find that magnon-phonon coupling produces Gilbert damping of comparable magnitude in three- and two-dimensional magnets, with qualitative differences between flexural phonons in free-standing monolayers and three-dimensional phonons in substrate-supported layers. By contrast, non-Gilbert damping due to four-magnon scattering is strongly enhanced in two dimensions, where it becomes independent of spin-orbit coupling. To benchmark the model against real materials, we introduce a numerical approach for computing magnon damping from ab initio-derived spin Hamiltonians. We demonstrate that the central conclusions of the model remain valid for magnons in bulk YIG and in a monolayer of the van der Waals magnetic insulator CrSBr.

Abstract: Halide perovskites have been extensively studied owing to their excellent optoelectronic properties and their unique lattice characteristics, that are very soft and anharmonic. Recent studies indicate the importance of a deep understanding of their surfaces and, in the limit, the properties of low-dimensional structures based on these materials. To investigate the structural and electronic properties of halide perovskite monolayers (i.e., perovskenes), this work uses first-principles simulations. We have studied three different stoichiometries (ABX3, ABX4, and A2BX4) and structural phases for iodide, bromide, and chloride perovskite monolayers. Their thermodynamic behavior was evaluated through the construction of phase diagrams, highlighting the instability of the ABX4 stoichiometry, which was further supported by its mechanical instability. Structurally, the covalent characteristics of the Pb--X bond, in contrast to the Cs--X bonds, induce a strong anisotropy in the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio along different crystallographic directions, and also account for the lower stiffness observed in the phases where the octahedra are not aligned. The electronic properties are somewhat similar to those of their 3D counterparts, but with a slightly larger band gap; in the monolayers, the band gap increases with halogen electronegativity (I, Br, Cl) and octahedral tilting. Moreover, the non-symmetric ABX3 stoichiometry exhibited a spin splitting due to the internal dipole moment in these layers. Overall, our work lays the groundwork for a deeper understanding of low-dimensional structures based on halide perovskites.

Abstract: Ag(I)-Bi(III)-based semiconductors have gained substantial attention as nontoxic, stable alternatives to lead-halide perovskites for optoelectronics, but are widely limited by carrier localization, which severely restricts diffusion lengths. The most efficient Ag/Bi solar absorber is AgBiS2, but diffusion lengths in nanocrystal films are <50 nm. Carrier localization in this rock-salt (Fm-3m) system is believed to arise from cation disorder, and so we herein investigate the layered cation-ordered analogue. Through beyond-DFT simulations combined with neutron and X-ray powder diffraction, we reveal that off-centring of Ag+ and Bi3+ cations is energetically-favoured in this cation-ordered phase. Despite local distortions in the AgS6 and BiS6 octahedra, band-like transport takes place, which, surprisingly, also occurs in the cation-disordered rock-salt phase when these materials are made as bulk powders. The cubic-phase powders have the same degree of cation disorder as the nanocrystals that have carrier localization, which suggests that extrinsic factors play a determining role. We ascribe the intrinsic band-like transport of both phases of AgBiS2 to its close packing, ensuring high electronic dimensionality. These insights offer pathways for designing solar absorbers avoiding carrier localization limitations, and call for future efforts to enhance the efficiency of AgBiS2 photovoltaics to focus on large-grained thin films, or improved nanocrystal surface passivation.

Abstract: Searching by chemical and structural analogy is one of the most commonly used and successful approaches to materials discovery. However, formulating this task for algorithmic implementation raises the question of how we define similar materials. Methods have been proposed for searching materials space using vectors based on chemical composition and functional fragments in the material. Descriptors for structural similarity have also been proposed. However, the question of how to incorporate and balance structural and compositional similarity measures in a single metric remains open. Here, we adapt methods developed for calculating distances between undirected graphs and apply them to crystalline materials similarity. The Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) metric uses optimal transport theory to map between two graphs considering a balance of the graph structure and the information present at the nodes of the graph (atoms in crystals). We apply the method to exploring new photovoltaic materials. We demonstrate that FGW is competitive with embeddings from an equivariant graph neural network, trained on $> 10^6$ materials, despite minimal training. We then apply FGW to a discovery campaign to identify materials from the Materials Project database that have not previously been explored as photovoltaics, but have similarities to known high-efficiency materials. After validating predictions with hybrid density functional theory, we identify seven previously unexplored high-efficiency photovoltaic absorber candidates, including Cs$_5$Sb$_8$, which is found to have a predicted SLME of $> 30\%$ and to be thermodynamically stable. The FGW approach demonstrates the power of strong inductive biases for developing metrics for materials exploration with minimal training data.

Abstract: The effects of pressure on the crystal structure of scheelite-type perrhenates were studied using synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction and density-functional theory. At ambient conditions, the studied materials AgReO4, KReO4, and RbReO4, exhibit a tetragonal scheelite-type crystal structure described by space group I41/a. Under compression, a transition from scheelite-to-M${\prime}$-fergusonite (space group P21/c) was observed at 1.6 and 7.4 GPa for RbReO4 and KReO4, respectively. The transition involves a relative volume decrease. On the other hand, AgReO4 underwent a phase transition to the M-fergusonite structure (space group I2/a) at 13.6 GPa. In this case there is no appreciable volume discontinuity. The room-temperature pressure-volume equation of state for the three studied perrhenates was estimated using a second-order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state. The results for the low-pressure phase are confirmed by density-functional theory calculations. The analysis of the bulk modulus shows that the compressibility of the compounds decreases following the sequence RbReO4 > KReO4 > AgReO4, which is related to the compressibility of the RbO8, KO8, and AgO8 bidisphenoid units. Density-functional theory also offers valuable insights into the elastic constants. Despite giving a good description for the low-pressure phase in the three compounds, density-functional theory cannot catch the structural phase transition observed in experiments. Reasons for it are discussed in the manuscript.

Abstract: We present an investigation into the crystal structure of ErVO4 under variable pressure conditions. The high-pressure single crystal X-ray diffraction experiments performed employing helium as the pressure medium facilitated structure refinements up to 24.1(2) GPa. The transition from zircon to scheelite was observed at a pressure of 7.9(1) GPa. In contrast to previous reports, we did not detect any sign of phase coexistence. We also did not observe the second phase transitions previously predicted by density-functional theory to occur below 20 GPa. The determination of the pressure dependence of unit-cell parameters and volume yields precise values for linear compressibility of each axis and the pressure-volume equation of state for both the zircon and scheelite phases. Additional information on the mechanical properties of ErVO4, obtained from density-functional theory calculations, is also reported.

Abstract: Thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cells are increasingly attractive for applications in industrial waste heat harvesting, aerospace energy management, and compact power generation. Deploying midwave-infrared (MWIR) TPV in practical applications requires narrow-bandgap semiconductors that not only absorb low-energy photons but also integrate with scalable, low-cost platforms. Although high-performance TPV devices have been demonstrated using III-V materials such as InAs, GaSb, and InGaAs(P), their use remains limited by cost and substrate size. With this perspective, narrow bandgap GeSn alloys are a promising alternative that extend group-IV absorption into the MWIR while being silicon-compatible. Although the potential of GeSn TPV cells has been predicted, no experimental demonstration has been reported. Here, proof-of-concept Ge$_{0.91}$Sn$_{0.09}$ p-i-n TPV diodes (1 mm diameter) grown on silicon were fabricated and their performance was benchmarked against commercial InAs and extended-InGaAs devices. Measurements at 300 K under 2.33 $μ$m laser and $\sim$1500 K SiC Globar illumination revealed peak responsivity of $\sim$ 0.2 A/W at $\sim$ 1.7 $μ$m, and an output power of $\sim$ 0.41 mW/cm$^2$. These devices show trends comparable to those of the InAs diode under identical conditions, although at reduced absolute levels. To assess the intrinsic performance potential, Poisson-drift-diffusion modeling incorporating experimentally calibrated emitter emissivity predicts power densities exceeding 1 W/cm$^2$ under moderate MWIR thermal illumination, indicating that the present devices operate far below their fundamental limits and are primarily constrained by defect-assisted recombination and transport losses. These results establish GeSn as a scalable, silicon-compatible MWIR TPV platform and highlight a larger performance potential achievable through material and device optimization.

Abstract: We investigate the size-dependent behavior of Miura-ori-based origami tessellations by changing the number of origami unit cells. For large tessellations, the Miura-ori sheet generally exhibits a negative in-plane Poisson's ratio, whereas if the size of the Miura-ori tessellations becomes small, the transition between positive and negative Poisson's ratio emerges in the middle of the folding process. Here, we show that such a transitioning point, i.e., zero Poisson's ratio, yields a kinematic locking state. We also experimentally demonstrate the tunable locking behavior altered by tessellation sizes. Extending the analysis to three-dimensional origami tessellations, we find that the direction of kinematic locking changes depending on the tessellation size. Varying tessellation size thus enables control over both the onset and the direction of locking in origami metamaterials.

Abstract: A central premise in evolutionary biology is that individual variation can generate information asymmetries that facilitate the emergence of hierarchical organisation. To examine this process, we develop an agent-based model (ABM) to identify the minimal conditions under which hierarchy arises in dynamic multi-agent systems, focusing on the roles of initial heterogeneity and mutation amplitude across generations. Hierarchical organisation is quantified using the Trophic Incoherence (TI) metric, which captures directional asymmetries in interaction networks. Our results show that even small individual differences can be amplified through repeated local interactions involving reproduction, competition, and cooperation, but that hierarchical order is markedly more sensitive to mutation amplitude than to initial heterogeneity. Across repeated trials, stable hierarchies reliably emerge only when mutation amplitude is sufficiently high, while initial heterogeneity primarily affects early formation rather than long-term persistence. Overall, these findings demonstrate how simple interaction rules can give rise to both the emergence and persistence of hierarchical organisation, providing a quantitative account of how structured inequality can develop from initially homogeneous populations.

We present Pancake, a multi-tier agentic memory system that unifies three key techniques: (i) multi-level index caching for single agents, (ii) coordinated index management across multiple agents, and (iii) collaborative GPU-CPU acceleration. Pancake exposes easy-to-use interface that can be integrated into memory-based agents like Mem-GPT, and is compatible with agentic frameworks such as LangChain and LlamaIndex. Experiments on realistic agent workloads show that Pancake substantially outperforms existing frameworks, achieving more than 4.29x end-to-end throughput improvement.

Abstract: Heralding the advent of autonomous vehicles and mobile robots that interact with humans, responsibility in spatial interaction is burgeoning as a research topic. Even though metrics of responsibility tailored to spatial interactions have been proposed, they are mostly focused on the responsibility of individual agents. Metrics of causal responsibility focusing on individuals fail in cases of causal overdeterminism -- when many actors simultaneously cause an outcome. To fill the gaps in causal responsibility left by individual-focused metrics, we formulate a metric for the causal responsibility of groups. To identify assertive agents that are causally responsible for the trajectory of an affected agent, we further formalise the types of assertive influences and propose a tiering algorithm for systematically identifying assertive agents. Finally, we use scenario-based simulations to illustrate the benefits of considering groups and how the emergence of group effects vary with interaction dynamics and the proximity of agents.

Abstract: Hole-spin qubits in planar Ge/SiGe heterostructures have attracted significant attention in recent years owing to their favorable electrical characteristics and prolonged coherence times. However, the strong spin-orbit interaction also makes them susceptible to charge noise and inhomogeneous strain. This is further exacerbated by the highly anisotropic g-factor of the planar design. Although there are some known strategies to suppress charge noise, one approach is to engineer an isotropic g-factor. In this work we analyze how qubit confinement profile affects the g-factor of hole-spin qubits. We show that decreasing the characteristic in-plane qubit confinement length reduces the g-factor anisotropy. We perform analytical and numerical analysis to compare two types of quantum wells: square wells and parabolic wells. We show that square wells have limited tunability, while parabolic wells offer broader tunability, making them more promising for qubit engineering.

Abstract: While molecular spin qubits (MSQs) are a promising platform for quantum computing, read-out has been largely limited to electron paramagnetic resonance which is often slow and requires a global system drive. Moreover, because one prerequisite for the Elzerman and Pauli spin blockade readout mechanisms typical of semiconductor spin qubits is tunneling of electrons between sites, these read-out modalities are unavailable in MSQs. Here, we theoretically demonstrate electrical read-out of entangled MSQs via driven many-electron spin unpolarized currents. In particular, using a time-dependent density matrix renormalization group approach we simulate a maximally entangled MSQ pair between two electronic leads. Driving itinerant electrons between the two leads, we find that the conductance is greater when the MSQs are in the entangled singlet state as compared to the entangled triplet state. This contrast in conductance is enhanced when the electronic density of states at the Fermi energy is large and for narrow bandwidth. Our results are readily applicable to molecules supramolecularly functionalizing semiconductors with relatively flat bands such as single-wall carbon nanotubes under a magnetic field.

We extend this analysis to the Landau problem of a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field in two dimensions and construct the generalized Laughlin wave functions for the case when the magnetic field is time-dependent. We also work out the dynamics of density fluctuations (the Girvin, MacDonald, Platzman or GMP mode) and argue that it is possible to tune the frequency of the magnetic field to obtain a compressible droplet of fermions. We also analyze the dynamics of the edge modes of the droplet for the integer Hall effect.

Abstract: Planar germanium is currently the only semiconducting platform where high-coherence spin qubits and proximity-induced superconductivity have each been demonstrated. Recent research into spin qubits in Ge/SiGe heterostructures has focused on increasing the thickness of the SiGe capping layer, reporting improvements in the electrostatic noise levels. Meanwhile, heterostructures with thinner capping layers remain rather unexplored, despite the potential advantages for proximity-induced superconductivity. Here, we study a Ge/SiGe heterostructure with a thin SiGe cap $d \approx 4\ \mathrm{nm}$ and investigate its viability to host low-noise quantum dots. To keep the thermal budget compatible with superconducting layers, low-temperature oxide deposition processes were developed and implemented for the gate dielectrics. The charge-noise level of fabricated devices is estimated to be $1.8 \pm 1.0\ μ\mathrm{eV}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$, comparable to devices fabricated on shallow heterostructures $\left(d \sim 20\ \mathrm{nm}\right)$ with high-temperature deposited oxides. Low charge-noise levels, together with the straightforward integration of superconductors, make this heterostructure an attractive platform for prototyping hybrid semiconducting-superconducting devices.

Abstract: In superconductor-semiconductor hybrid structures, superconductivity and spin polarization are competing effects because magnetic fields break Cooper pairs. They can be combined using thin films and in-plane magnetic fields, an approach that enabled the pursuit of Majorana zero modes, Kitaev chains, and Andreev spin qubits (ASQs), but remains challenging for materials with small in-plane g-factors. Here we show that granular aluminum (grAl), composed of nanometer-scale aluminum grains embedded in an amorphous oxide matrix, can overcome this limitation. By depositing grAl on Ge/SiGe heterostructures, we induce a hard superconducting gap with BCS peaks at 305 $μ$eV and magnetic-field resilience for both the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, allowing Zeeman splitting of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states beyond 50 $μ$eV (12 GHz). Leveraging this robustness, we reveal signatures of hole physics and demonstrate g-tensor tunability.

Abstract: Phonon modes within pristine crystalline resonators now routinely reach the quantum ground state. Such systems are attractive for quantum information science applications, as advanced fabrication and processing can enable relatively long quantum coherence times, and precision control can be realized through optical, electrical, or qubit coupling. In many state-of-the-art systems, the phonon lifetime is limited by disorder. In particular, native oxides or damaged `dead layers' at surfaces can host two-level tunneling states that lead to a particularly problematic form of dissipation that increases at lower temperatures. As mechanical losses are driven down in systems such as micro-fabricated bulk acoustic wave resonators, tunneling states are expected to emerge as the dominant mechanism for phonon decoherence. A quantitative description of these mesoscopic systems therefore requires a framework that captures interactions between a selected phonon mode and a large ensemble of TLS. Here, we derive a quantum master equation for this coupled system, permitting the phonon decoherence produced by two-level tunneling states to be calculated. As an example, we estimate the lifetime of a variety of quantum states within quartz micro-resonators hosting a thin surface layer of tunneling states. We find that the phonon coherence time is maximized at low temperatures, in spite of increased mechanical dissipation, and that phonon-TLS coupling can be reduced for modes with strain nodes at the surfaces.

Abstract: Schottky junctions based on transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have emerged as key building blocks for next-generation optoelectronic devices that demand ultrafast response and high sensitivity. However, the ultrafast, nanoscale carrier dynamics at these interfaces, crucial for device performance, have remained experimentally elusive. Here, we introduce optical pump-probe time-resolved atomic force microscopy to directly visualize, in real space, the nanosecond-scale modulation of the Schottky barrier potential at a van der Waals junction formed by point contact between WSe2 and a PtIr tip. Complementary analyses using transient absorption spectroscopy and light-modulated current-voltage characteristics together with model simulations reveal that time-resolved currents originate from the concerted temporal evolution of photoexcited carriers and the subsequent barrier response, processes that also define the rate-limiting steps of the photocurrent. Our results uncover the essential interfacial dynamics that underpin TMDC-based photodetectors and photovoltaic elements, while establishing a new measurement paradigm that complements and extends existing spectroscopic techniques. This approach provides direct access to nonequilibrium processes hidden at nanoscale interfaces, offering a powerful route to rational design of high-performance optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are nanoscale, topologically protected spin textures with exceptional potential for high density data storage and energy efficient computing. Among various skyrmion hosting systems, rare earth transition metal ferrimagnets offer a promising platform due to their tunable magnetic properties and intrinsically low net magnetization. Despite this, the fundamental control of ferrimagnetic skyrmions in single layer films remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a viable route for engineering room temperature skyrmions in GdFe single layers through precise control of film thickness (60 to 80 nm). Thickness variation enables the systematic tuning of key magnetic parameters, including perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and saturation magnetization, thereby allowing precise control over skyrmion size and density. Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) reveals a clear thickness dependent evolution of isolated skyrmion characteristics, where skyrmion size decreases while skyrmion density increases with increasing GdFe film thickness, in agreement with micromagnetic simulations. At the same time, magnetotransport measurements show a systematic enhancement in the topological Hall resistivity with thickness, further corroborating the increased skyrmion density observed in MFM. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals a compositional gradient across the film thickness, indicative of structural asymmetry and potential inversion symmetry breaking, contributing to the emergence of a bulk Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction. Notably, sub 60nm skyrmions with high areal density are stabilized at room temperature. This work provides a viable route to tailor the properties of ferrimagnetic skyrmions in single-layer GdFe films, paving the way for the development of high-density ferrimagnetic skyrmionic devices.

Abstract: We investigate the interplay between complex magnetic orders and topological electronic states in nonsymmorphic magnetic Weyl semimetals on the ReAlX family (Re is a rare earth element and X is Si or Ge). We construct a lattice model incorporating conduction Weyl fermions coupled to localized magnetic moments via Kondo interaction. By considering a multi-${\bf Q}$ cycloid magnetic configuration, which can evolve into a Skyrmion lattice under an in-plane Zeeman field, we analyze its profound impact on the band structure through magnetic Brillouin zone and band-folding. Using the Kubo formula, we calculate the conductivity tensor and examine the transport properties in the clean limit. Our results reveal that the Skyrmion lattice induces significant changes in electrical and Hall conductivities. Furthermore, the temperature-dependent resistivity deviates from the standard Fermi-liquid behavior ($ρ_{xx}\sim T^2$), showing a power-law scaling ($ρ_{xx}\sim T^α$ with $α$ between 3 and 5), indicative of non-Fermi liquid behavior. This work provides a theoretical framework connecting multi-${\bf Q}$ magnetic textures, Skyrmion physics, and anomalous transport in topological semimetals.

Abstract: Chirality-dependent spin generation has attracted considerable attention in condensed matter physics. In this paper, we theoretically investigate antiparallel spin polarization as a chirality-dependent quadratic response, by using a finite chiral system composed of triangular prisms. Based on the nonlinear Kubo formalism and real-time simulations, we demonstrate that spatially inhomogeneous antiparallel spin polarizations are induced as a dissipative quadratic DC response to a homogeneous AC electric field. In particular, we elucidate role of microscopic parameters characterizing the handedness of chirality, and naive expectation of spin polarization as a consequence of spin accumulation of spin current.

Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) flakes are key building blocks for encapsulating two-dimensional (2D) materials, providing atomically flat surfaces and an excellent dielectric environment for high-mobility field-effect transistors and tunnelling devices. However, strain induced during mechanical exfoliation and assembly of van der Waals heterostructures may lead to plastic deformations of the hBN surface, injecting dislocation lines between the topmost layer and the underlying film. Since a monolayer of hBN is non-centrosymmetric and exhibits a piezoelectric response to deformation, individual dislocations and, in particular their networks, can generate electrostatic potential modulations in the encapsulated 2D material. Here, we examine scenarios in which the top hBN layer is uniaxially strained and/or twisted, and show how lattice reconstruction into dislocation networks leads to the formation of piezoelectric charge hotspots that effectively behave as charged defects.

Abstract: The position noise spectra of six drums on a single chip were measured on a single cooldown below 1.3 kelvin. Cryostat temperatures as low as 0.7 mK were achieved. The temperature dependence of the resonance frequency and linewidth of the drum modes was analyzed in the framework of the tunneling two level system (TLS) model. Departures of the resonance frequency and the position noise power from the expected logarithmic and linear temperature dependences, respectively, were interpreted as indications of thermal decoupling from the cryostat. This previously unexplored measurement configuration revealed that similar neighboring drums on a single chip may be at different temperatures. At the lowest temperatures, some drums exhibited excess damping that decreased with temperature. The magnitude of the excess damping of the drums was correlated with the thermal coupling of their TLS to the cryostat. In the case of one drum, a temporary increase in its damping coincided with a decrease in its mode temperature. The thermalization of the TLS to the cold finger was independent of pump power, pulse tube state and temperature of the pre-cooling stages of the cryostat. These results reveal an interplay between TLS damping and thermalization of nanomechanics that motivates further theoretical work and may impact efforts to extend the coherence of mechanical resonators.

Abstract: We predict a novel class of magnetotransport oscillations in ballistic graphene specific for a ring-shape geometry. Using the Büttiker-Landauer formalism, we analytically obtain the local Hall and Nernst coefficients in the weak-field ballistic regime. These coefficients exhibit pronounced oscillations as functions of both the magnetic field and the angular positions of the measurement probes. The oscillations originate from the discrete set of skipping orbits that geometrically connect the contacts, with resonances occurring when the angular separation between contacts times the radius of the disk equals an integer number of cyclotron diameters. Unlike conventional quantum oscillations in conductivity, this effect is robust at room temperature and can dominate local thermoelectric signals. This geometric control of ballistic flow provides a platform for studying electron hydrodynamics and engineering phase-coherent devices, with potential applications in sensitive terahertz detectors and thermal management systems.

Abstract: In the era of big data and the Internet of Things, quantum-level control of conductance states offers a promising route toward high-density data storage and brain-inspired neuromorphic computing. Although quantum conductance (QC) phenomena have been demonstrated in various metal oxide memristors, achieving reliable and precise control over quantized states remains in its infancy. Here, we demonstrate bidirectional quantum conductance states in multifunctional BiFeO3 (BFO) perovskite memristors integrated with multilayer-graphene contacts, enabling higher-order tunability and revealing the potential of perovskite-2D heterostructures for quantum-engineered memory and computing devices. XPS analysis provides detailed insights into oxygen vacancy dynamics in BFO, whereas first-principles density functional theory calculations clearly reveal a strong localized electric field at the graphene-BFO interface. Our devices exhibit current-controlled higher-order QC transitions facilitated by quantum point contact formation, giving rise to quantized conductance states during both SET and RESET processes. Time-lag correlation maps quantify the stochastic evolution of QC states under dynamic voltage-pulse tuning schemes. Notably, the quantized conductance states effectively emulate synaptic potentiation and depression, enabling precise weight modulation for high-accuracy image and digit recognition in convolutional neural networks. These findings establish perovskite-2D heterostructures as promising candidates for QC-driven resistive switching and demonstrate their potential for developing controllable quantum memristors.

Abstract: Hybrid Unmanned Aerial Underwater Vehicles (HUAUVs) have emerged as platforms capable of operating in both aerial and underwater environments, enabling applications such as inspection, mapping, search, and rescue in challenging scenarios. However, the development of novel methodologies poses significant challenges due to the distinct dynamics and constraints of the air and water domains. In this work, we present persistent monitoring tasks for HUAUVs by combining Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Transfer Learning to enable cross-domain adaptability. Our approach employs a shared DRL architecture trained on Lidar sensor data (on air) and Sonar data (underwater), demonstrating the feasibility of a unified policy for both environments. We further show that the methodology presents promising results, taking into account the uncertainty of the environment and the dynamics of multiple mobile targets. The proposed framework lays the groundwork for scalable autonomous persistent monitoring solutions based on DRL for hybrid aerial-underwater vehicles.

Abstract: Reliable vehicle navigation in urban environments remains a challenging problem due to frequent satellite signal blockages caused by tall buildings and complex infrastructure. While fusing inertial reading with satellite positioning in an extended Kalman filter provides short-term navigation continuity, low-cost inertial sensors suffer from rapid error accumulation during prolonged outages. Existing information aiding approaches, such as the non-holonomic constraint, impose rigid equality assumptions on vehicle motion that may be violated under dynamic urban driving conditions, limiting their robustness precisely when aiding is most needed. In this paper, we propose a dual-branch information aiding framework that fuses equality and inequality motion constraints through a variance-weighted scheme, requiring only a software modification to an existing navigation filter with no additional sensors or hardware. The proposed method is evaluated on four publicly available urban datasets featuring various inertial sensors, road conditions, and dynamics, covering a total duration of 4.3 hours of recorded data. Under Full GNSS availability, the method reduces vertical position error by 16.7% and improves altitude accuracy by 50.1% over the standard non-holonomic constraint. Under GNSS-denied conditions, vertical drift is reduced by 24.2% and altitude accuracy improves by 20.2%. These results demonstrate that replacing hard motion equality assumptions with physically motivated inequality bounds is a practical and cost-free strategy for improving navigation resilience, continuity, and drift robustness without relying on additional sensors, map data, or learned models.

Abstract: Dynamic manipulation of deformable objects is challenging for humans and robots because they have infinite degrees of freedom and exhibit underactuated dynamics. We introduce a Task-Level Iterative Learning Control method for dynamic manipulation of deformable objects. We demonstrate this method on a non-planar rope manipulation task called the flying knot. Using a single human demonstration and a simplified rope model, the method learns directly on hardware without reliance on large amounts of demonstration data or massive amounts of simulation. At each iteration, the algorithm constructs a local inverse model of the robot and rope by solving a quadratic program to propagate task-space errors into action updates. We evaluate performance across 7 different kinds of ropes, including chain, latex surgical tubing, and braided and twisted ropes, ranging in thicknesses of 7--25mm and densities of 0.013--0.5 kg/m. Learning achieves a 100\% success rate within 10 trials on all ropes. Furthermore, the method can successfully transfer between most rope types in approximately 2--5 trials. https://flying-knots.github.io

Abstract: Soft robots were introduced in large part to enable safe, adaptive interaction with the environment, and this interaction relies fundamentally on contact. However, modeling and planning contact-rich interactions for soft robots remain challenging: dense contact candidates along the body create redundant constraints and rank-deficient LCPs, while the disparity between high stiffness and low friction introduces severe ill-conditioning. Existing approaches rely on problem-specific approximations or penalty-based treatments. This letter presents a unified complementarity-based framework for soft-robot contact modeling and planning that brings contact modeling, manipulation, and planning into a unified, physically consistent formulation. We develop a robust Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP) model tailored to discretized soft robots and address these challenges with a three-stage conditioning pipeline: inertial rank selection to remove redundant contacts, Ruiz equilibration to correct scale disparity and ill-conditioning, and lightweight Tikhonov regularization on normal blocks. Building on the same formulation, we introduce a kinematically guided warm-start strategy that enables dynamic trajectory optimization through contact using Mathematical Programs with Complementarity Constraints (MPCC) and demonstrate its effectiveness on contact-rich ball manipulation tasks. In conclusion, CUSP provides a new foundation for unifying contact modeling, simulation, and planning in soft robotics.

Abstract: General-purpose simulators have accelerated the development of robots. Traditional simulators based on first-principles, however, typically require full-state observability or depend on parameter search for system identification. This work presents \texttt{CableRobotGraphSim}, a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) model for cable-driven robots that aims to address shortcomings of prior simulation solutions. By representing cable-driven robots as graphs, with the rigid-bodies as nodes and the cables and contacts as edges, this model can quickly and accurately match the properties of other simulation models and real robots, while ingesting only partially observable inputs. Accompanying the GNN model is a sim-and-real co-training procedure that promotes generalization and robustness to noisy real data. This model is further integrated with a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller for closed-loop navigation, which showcases the model's speed and accuracy.

Abstract: Ensuring accurate and stable state estimation is a challenging task crucial to safety-critical domains such as high-speed autonomous racing, where measurement uncertainty must be both adaptive to the environment and temporally smooth for control. In this work, we develop a learning-based framework, LACE, capable of directly modeling the temporal dynamics of GNSS measurement covariance. We model the covariance evolution as an exponentially stable dynamical system where a deep neural network (DNN) learns to predict the system's process noise from environmental features through an attention mechanism. By using contraction-based stability and systematically imposing spectral constraints, we formally provide guarantees of exponential stability and smoothness for the resulting covariance dynamics. We validate our approach on an AV-24 autonomous racecar, demonstrating improved localization performance and smoother covariance estimates in challenging, GNSS-degraded environments. Our results highlight the promise of dynamically modeling the perceived uncertainty in state estimation problems that are tightly coupled with control sensitivity.

Abstract: Autonomous robots can transform how we observe marine ecosystems, but close-range operation in reefs and other cluttered habitats remains difficult. Vehicles must maneuver safely near animals and fragile structures while coping with currents, variable illumination and limited sensing. Previous approaches simplify these problems by leveraging soft materials and bioinspired swimming designs, but such platforms remain limited in terms of deployable autonomy. Here we present a sea turtle-inspired autonomous underwater robot that closed the gap between bioinspired locomotion and field-ready autonomy through a tightly integrated, vision-driven control stack. The robot combines robust depth-heading stabilization with obstacle avoidance and target-centric control, enabling it to track and interact with moving objects in complex terrain. We validate the robot in controlled pool experiments and in a live coral reef exhibit at the New England Aquarium, demonstrating stable operation and reliable tracking of fast-moving marine animals and human divers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first integrated biomimetic robotic system, combining novel hardware, control, and field experiments, deployed to track and monitor real marine animals in their natural environment. During off-tether experiments, we demonstrate safe navigation around obstacles (91\% success rate in the aquarium exhibit) and introduce a low-compute onboard tracking mode. Together, these results establish a practical route toward soft-rigid hybrid, bioinspired underwater robots capable of minimally disruptive exploration and close-range monitoring in sensitive ecosystems.

Abstract: Multi-robot task planning requires decomposing natural-language instructions into executable actions for heterogeneous robot teams. Conventional Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) planners provide rigorous guarantees but struggle to handle ambiguous or long-horizon missions, while large language models (LLMs) can interpret instructions and propose plans but may hallucinate or produce infeasible actions. We present a hierarchical multi-agent LLM-based planner with prompt optimization: an upper layer decomposes tasks and assigns them to lower-layer agents, which generate PDDL problems solved by a classical planner. When plans fail, the system applies TextGrad-inspired textual-gradient updates to optimize each agent's prompt and thereby improve planning accuracy. In addition, meta-prompts are learned and shared across agents within the same layer, enabling efficient prompt optimization in multi-agent settings. On the MAT-THOR benchmark, our planner achieves success rates of 0.95 on compound tasks, 0.84 on complex tasks, and 0.60 on vague tasks, improving over the previous state-of-the-art LaMMA-P by 2, 7, and 15 percentage points respectively. An ablation study shows that the hierarchical structure, prompt optimization, and meta-prompt sharing contribute roughly +59, +37, and +4 percentage points to the overall success rate.

Abstract: This work presents a wearable human activity recognition (HAR) system that performs real-time inference directly inside a shank-mounted inertial measurement unit (IMU) to support low-latency control of a lower-limb exoskeleton. Unlike conventional approaches that continuously stream raw inertial data to a microcontroller for classification, the proposed system executes activity recognition at the sensor level using the embedded Machine Learning Core (MLC) of the STMicroelectronics LSM6DSV16X IMU, allowing the host microcontroller to remain in a low-power state and read only the recognized activity label from IMU registers. While the system generalizes to multiple human activities, this paper focuses on three representative locomotion modes - stance, level walking, and stair ascent - using data collected from adult participants. A lightweight decision-tree model was configured and deployed for on-sensor execution using ST MEMS Studio, enabling continuous operation without custom machine learning code on the microcontroller. During operation, the IMU asserts an interrupt when motion or a new classification is detected; the microcontroller wakes, reads the MLC output registers, and forwards the inferred mode to the exoskeleton controller. This interrupt-driven, on-sensor inference architecture reduces computation and communication overhead while preserving battery energy and improving robustness in distinguishing level walking from stair ascent for torque-assist control.

Abstract: Action chunking has recently emerged as a standard practice in flow-based Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. However, the effect and choice of the execution horizon - the number of actions to be executed from each predicted chunk - remains underexplored. In this work, we first show that varying the execution horizon leads to substantial performance deviations, with performance initially improving and then declining as the horizon increases. To uncover the reasons, we analyze the cross- and self-attention weights in flow-based VLAs and reveal two key phenomena: (i) intra-chunk actions attend invariantly to vision-language tokens, limiting adaptability to environmental changes; and (ii) the initial and terminal action tokens serve as stable anchors, forming latent centers around which intermediate actions are organized. Motivated by these insights, we interpret action self-attention weights as a proxy for the model's predictive limit and propose AutoHorizon, the first test-time method that dynamically estimates the execution horizon for each predicted action chunk to adapt to changing perceptual conditions. Across simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, AutoHorizon is performant, incurs negligible computational overhead, and generalizes across diverse tasks and flow-based models.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel vector field strategy for controlling fully-actuated systems on connected matrix Lie groups, ensuring convergence to and traversal along a curve defined on the group. Our approach generalizes our previous work (Rezende et al., 2022) and reduces to it when considering the Lie group of translations in Euclidean space. Since the proofs in Rezende et al. (2022) rely on key properties such as the orthogonality between the convergent and traversal components, we extend these results by leveraging Lie group properties. These properties also allow the control input to be non-redundant, meaning it matches the dimension of the Lie group, rather than the potentially larger dimension of the space in which the group is embedded. This can lead to more practical control inputs in certain scenarios. A particularly notable application of our strategy is in controlling systems on SE(3) -- in this case, the non-redundant input corresponds to the object's mechanical twist -- making it well-suited for controlling objects that can move and rotate freely, such as omnidirectional drones. In this case, we provide an efficient algorithm to compute the vector field. We experimentally validate the proposed method using a robotic manipulator to demonstrate its effectiveness.

Abstract: General-purpose robots must master long-horizon manipulation, defined as tasks involving multiple kinematic structure changes (e.g., attaching or detaching objects) in unstructured environments. While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer the potential to master diverse atomic skills, they struggle with the combinatorial complexity of sequencing them and are prone to cascading failures due to environmental sensitivity. To address these challenges, we propose LiLo-VLA (Linked Local VLA), a modular framework capable of zero-shot generalization to novel long-horizon tasks without ever being trained on them. Our approach decouples transport from interaction: a Reaching Module handles global motion, while an Interaction Module employs an object-centric VLA to process isolated objects of interest, ensuring robustness against irrelevant visual features and invariance to spatial configurations. Crucially, this modularity facilitates robust failure recovery through dynamic replanning and skill reuse, effectively mitigating the cascading errors common in end-to-end approaches. We introduce a 21-task simulation benchmark consisting of two challenging suites: LIBERO-Long++ and Ultra-Long. In these simulations, LiLo-VLA achieves a 69% average success rate, outperforming Pi0.5 by 41% and OpenVLA-OFT by 67%. Furthermore, real-world evaluations across 8 long-horizon tasks demonstrate an average success rate of 85%. Project page: https://yy-gx.github.io/LiLo-VLA/.

Abstract: Tilt-rotor aerial robots enable omnidirectional maneuvering through thrust vectoring, but introduce significant control challenges due to the strong coupling between joint and rotor dynamics. While model-based controllers can achieve high motion accuracy under nominal conditions, their robustness and responsiveness often degrade in the presence of disturbances and modeling uncertainties. This work investigates reinforcement learning for omnidirectional aerial motion control on over-actuated tiltable quadrotors that prioritizes robustness and agility. We present a learning-based control framework that enables efficient acquisition of coordinated rotor-joint behaviors for reaching target poses in the $SE(3)$ space. To achieve reliable sim-to-real transfer while preserving motion accuracy, we integrate system identification with minimal and physically consistent domain randomization. Compared with a state-of-the-art NMPC controller, the proposed method achieves comparable six-degree-of-freedom pose tracking accuracy, while demonstrating superior robustness and generalization across diverse tasks, enabling zero-shot deployment on real hardware.

Abstract: Embodied Task Planning with large language models faces safety challenges in real-world environments, where partial observability and physical constraints must be respected. Existing benchmarks often overlook these critical factors, limiting their ability to evaluate both feasibility and safety. We introduce SPOC, a benchmark for safety-aware embodied task planning, which integrates strict partial observability, physical constraints, step-by-step planning, and goal-condition-based evaluation. Covering diverse household hazards such as fire, fluid, injury, object damage, and pollution, SPOC enables rigorous assessment through both state and constraint-based online metrics. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that current models struggle to ensure safety-aware planning, particularly under implicit constraints.

Abstract: Physics-based humanoid control relies on training with motion datasets that have diverse data distributions. However, the fixed difficulty distribution of datasets limits the performance ceiling of the trained control policies. Additionally, the method of acquiring high-quality data through professional motion capture systems is constrained by costs, making it difficult to achieve large-scale scalability. To address these issues, we propose a closed-loop automated motion data generation and iterative framework. It can generate high-quality motion data with rich action semantics, including martial arts, dance, combat, sports, gymnastics, and more. Furthermore, our framework enables difficulty iteration of policies and data through physical metrics and objective evaluations, allowing the trained tracker to break through its original difficulty limits. On the PHC single-primitive tracker, using only approximately 1/10 of the AMASS dataset size, the average failure rate on the test set (2201 clips) is reduced by 45\% compared to the baseline. Finally, we conduct comprehensive ablation and comparative experiments to highlight the rationality and advantages of our framework.

Abstract: Quadrupedal wheeled-legged robots combine the advantages of legged and wheeled locomotion to achieve superior mobility, but executing dynamic jumps remains a significant challenge due to the additional degrees of freedom introduced by wheeled legs. This paper develops a mini-sized wheeled-legged robot for agile motion and presents a novel motion control framework that integrates the Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) for locomotion and the Differential Evolution (DE) based trajectory optimization for jumping in quadrupedal wheeled-legged robots. The proposed controller utilizes wheel motion and locomotion to enhance jumping performance, achieving versatile maneuvers such as vertical jumping, forward jumping, and backflips. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of the framework, demonstrating a forward jump over a 0.12 m obstacle and a vertical jump reaching 0.5 m.

Abstract: Multi-agent robotic manipulation remains challenging due to the combined demands of coordination, grasp stability, and collision avoidance in shared workspaces. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Dynamic Modality Diffusion Policy (ADM-DP), a framework that integrates vision, tactile, and graph-based (multi-agent pose) modalities for coordinated control. ADM-DP introduces four key innovations. First, an enhanced visual encoder merges RGB and point-cloud features via Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) modulation to enrich perception. Second, a tactile-guided grasping strategy uses Force-Sensitive Resistor (FSR) feedback to detect insufficient contact and trigger corrective grasp refinement, improving grasp stability. Third, a graph-based collision encoder leverages shared tool center point (TCP) positions of multiple agents as structured kinematic context to maintain spatial awareness and reduce inter-agent interference. Fourth, an Adaptive Modality Attention Mechanism (AMAM) dynamically re-weights modalities according to task context, enabling flexible fusion. For scalability and modularity, a decoupled training paradigm is employed in which agents learn independent policies while sharing spatial information. This maintains low interdependence between agents while retaining collective awareness. Across seven multi-agent tasks, ADM-DP achieves 12-25% performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies show the greatest improvements in tasks requiring multiple sensory modalities, validating our adaptive fusion strategy and demonstrating its robustness for diverse manipulation scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-Based Tactile Sensors (VBTS) are essential for achieving dexterous robotic manipulation, yet the tactile sim-to-real gap remains a fundamental bottleneck. Current tactile simulations suffer from a persistent dilemma: simplified geometric projections lack physical authenticity, while high-fidelity Finite Element Methods (FEM) are too computationally prohibitive for large-scale reinforcement learning. In this work, we present Tacmap, a high-fidelity, computationally efficient tactile simulation framework anchored in volumetric penetration depth. Our key insight is to bridge the tactile sim-to-real gap by unifying both domains through a shared deform map representation. Specifically, we compute 3D intersection volumes as depth maps in simulation, while in the real world, we employ an automated data-collection rig to learn a robust mapping from raw tactile images to ground-truth depth maps. By aligning simulation and real-world in this unified geometric space, Tacmap minimizes domain shift while maintaining physical consistency. Quantitative evaluations across diverse contact scenarios demonstrate that Tacmap's deform maps closely mirror real-world measurements. Moreover, we validate the utility of Tacmap through an in-hand rotation task, where a policy trained exclusively in simulation achieves zero-shot transfer to a physical robot.

Abstract: Standard vision-language-action (VLA) models rely on fitting statistical data priors, limiting their robust understanding of underlying physical dynamics. Reinforcement learning enhances physical grounding through exploration yet typically relies on external reward signals that remain isolated from the agent's internal states. World action models have emerged as a promising paradigm that integrates imagination and control to enable predictive planning. However, they rely on implicit context modeling, lacking explicit mechanisms for self-improvement. To solve these problems, we propose Self-Correcting VLA (SC-VLA), which achieve self-improvement by intrinsically guiding action refinement through sparse imagination. We first design sparse world imagination by integrating auxiliary predictive heads to forecast current task progress and future trajectory trends, thereby constraining the policy to encode short-term physical evolution. Then we introduce the online action refinement module to reshape progress-dependent dense rewards, adjusting trajectory orientation based on the predicted sparse future states. Evaluations on challenging robot manipulation tasks from simulation benchmarks and real-world settings demonstrate that SC-VLA achieve state-of-the-art performance, yielding the highest task throughput with 16% fewer steps and a 9% higher success rate than the best-performing baselines, alongside a 14% gain in real-world experiments.

Abstract: Mobile robots and IoT devices demand real-time localization and dense reconstruction under tight compute and energy budgets. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient dense SLAM, dynamic objects and occlusions still degrade tracking and mapping. Existing dynamic 3DGS-SLAM often relies on heavy optical flow and per-frame segmentation, which is costly for mobile deployment and brittle under challenging illumination. We present DAGS-SLAM, a dynamic-aware 3DGS-SLAM system that maintains a spatiotemporal motion probability (MP) state per Gaussian and triggers semantics on demand via an uncertainty-aware scheduler. DAGS-SLAM fuses lightweight YOLO instance priors with geometric cues to estimate and temporally update MP, propagates MP to the front-end for dynamic-aware correspondence selection, and suppresses dynamic artifacts in the back-end via MP-guided optimization. Experiments on public dynamic RGB-D benchmarks show improved reconstruction and robust tracking while sustaining real-time throughput on a commodity GPU, demonstrating a practical speed-accuracy tradeoff with reduced semantic invocations toward mobile deployment.

Abstract: It remains challenging to achieve human-like locomotion in legged robots due to fundamental discrepancies between biological and mechanical structures. Although imitation learning has emerged as a promising approach for generating natural robotic movements, simply replicating joint angle trajectories fails to capture the underlying principles of human motion. This study proposes a Gait Divergence Analysis Framework (GDAF), a unified biomechanical evaluation framework that systematically quantifies kinematic and kinetic discrepancies between humans and bipedal robots. We apply GDAF to systematically compare human and humanoid locomotion across 28 walking speeds. To enable reproducible analysis, we collect and release a speed-continuous humanoid locomotion dataset from a state-of-the-art humanoid controller. We further provide an open-source implementation of GDAF, including analysis, visualization, and MuJoCo-based tools, enabling quantitative, interpretable, and reproducible biomechanical analysis of humanoid locomotion. Results demonstrate that despite visually human-like motion generated by modern humanoid controllers, significant biomechanical divergence persists across speeds. Robots exhibit systematic deviations in gait symmetry, energy distribution, and joint coordination, indicating that substantial room remains for improving the biomechanical fidelity and energetic efficiency of humanoid locomotion. This work provides a quantitative benchmark for evaluating humanoid locomotion and offers data and versatile tools to support the development of more human-like and energetically efficient locomotion controllers. The data and code will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Autonomous parking fundamentally differs from on-road driving due to its frequent direction changes and complex maneuvering requirements. However, existing End-to-End (E2E) planning methods often simplify the parking task into a geometric path regression problem, neglecting explicit modeling of the vehicle's kinematic state. This "dimensionality deficiency" easily leads to physically infeasible trajectories and deviates from real human driving behavior, particularly at critical gear-shift points in multi-shot parking scenarios. In this paper, we propose SunnyParking, a novel dual-branch E2E architecture that achieves motion state awareness by jointly predicting spatial trajectories and discrete motion state sequences (e.g., forward/reverse). Additionally, we introduce a Fourier feature-based representation of target parking slots to overcome the resolution limitations of traditional bird's-eye view (BEV) approaches, enabling high-precision target interactions. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework generates more robust and human-like trajectories in complex multi-shot parking scenarios, while significantly improving gear-shift point localization accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. We open-source a new parking dataset of the CARLA simulator, specifically designed to evaluate full prediction capabilities under complex maneuvers.

Abstract: Multi-modal distribution in robotic manipulation action sequences poses critical challenges for imitation learning. To this end, existing approaches often model the action space as either a discrete set of tokens or a continuous, latent-variable distribution. However, both approaches present trade-offs: some methods discretize actions into tokens and therefore lose fine-grained action variations, while others generate continuous actions in a single stage tend to produce unstable mode transitions. To address these limitations, we propose Primary-Fine Decoupling for Action Generation (PF-DAG), a two-stage framework that decouples coarse action consistency from fine-grained variations. First, we compress action chunks into a small set of discrete modes, enabling a lightweight policy to select consistent coarse modes and avoid mode bouncing. Second, a mode conditioned MeanFlow policy is learned to generate high-fidelity continuous actions. Theoretically, we prove PF-DAG's two-stage design achieves a strictly lower MSE bound than single-stage generative policies. Empirically, PF-DAG outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across 56 tasks from Adroit, DexArt, and MetaWorld benchmarks. It further generalizes to real-world tactile dexterous manipulation tasks. Our work demonstrates that explicit mode-level decoupling enables both robust multi-modal modeling and reactive closed-loop control for robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Trajectory generation for visually impaired scenarios requires smooth and temporally consistent state in structured, low-speed dynamic environments. However, traditional jerk-based heuristic trajectory sampling with independent segment generation and conventional smoothness penalties often lead to unstable terminal behavior and state discontinuities under frequent regenerating. This paper proposes a trajectory generation approach that integrates endpoint regulation to stabilize terminal states within each segment and momentum-aware dynamics to regularize the evolution of velocity and acceleration for segment consistency. Endpoint regulation is incorporated into trajectory sampling to stabilize terminal behavior, while a momentum-aware dynamics enforces consistent velocity and acceleration evolution across consecutive trajectory segments. Experimental results demonstrate reduced acceleration peaks and lower jerk levels with decreased dispersion, smoother velocity and acceleration profiles, more stable endpoint distributions, and fewer infeasible trajectory candidates compared with a baseline planner.

Abstract: Winged blimps operate across distinct aerodynamic regimes that cannot be adequately captured by a single model. At high speeds and small angles of attack, their dynamics exhibit strong coupling between lift and attitude, resembling fixed-wing aircraft behavior. At low speeds or large angles of attack, viscous effects and flow separation dominate, leading to drag-driven and damping-dominated dynamics. Accurately representing transitions between these regimes remains a fundamental challenge. This paper presents a hybrid aerodynamic modeling framework that integrates a fixed-wing Aerodynamic Coupling Model (ACM) and a Generalized Drag Model (GDM) using a learned neural network mixer with explicit physics-based regularization. The mixer enables smooth transitions between regimes while retaining explicit, physics-based aerodynamic representation. Model parameters are identified through a structured three-phase pipeline tailored for hybrid aerodynamic modeling. The proposed approach is validated on the RGBlimp platform through a large-scale experimental campaign comprising 1,320 real-world flight trajectories across 330 thruster and moving mass configurations, spanning a wide range of speeds and angles of attack. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model consistently outperforms single-model and predefined-mixer baselines, establishing a practical and robust aerodynamic modeling solution for winged blimps.

Abstract: Humanoid robots that autonomously interact with physical environments over extended horizons represent a central goal of embodied intelligence. Existing approaches rely on reference motions or task-specific rewards, tightly coupling policies to particular object geometries and precluding multi-skill generalization within a single framework. A unified interaction representation enabling reference-free inference, geometric generalization, and long-horizon skill composition within one policy remains an open challenge. Here we show that Distance Field (DF) provides such a representation: LessMimic conditions a single whole-body policy on DF-derived geometric cues--surface distances, gradients, and velocity decompositions--removing the need for motion references, with interaction latents encoded via a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) and post-trained using Adversarial Interaction Priors (AIP) under Reinforcement Learning (RL). Through DAgger-style distillation that aligns DF latents with egocentric depth features, LessMimic further transfers seamlessly to vision-only deployment without motion capture (MoCap) infrastructure. A single LessMimic policy achieves 80--100% success across object scales from 0.4x to 1.6x on PickUp and SitStand where baselines degrade sharply, attains 62.1% success on 5 task instances trajectories, and remains viable up to 40 sequentially composed tasks. By grounding interaction in local geometry rather than demonstrations, LessMimic offers a scalable path toward humanoid robots that generalize, compose skills, and recover from failures in unstructured environments.

Abstract: Despite progress, Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) are limited by a scarcity of large-scale, diverse robot data. While human manipulation videos offer a rich alternative, existing methods are forced to choose between small, precisely-labeled datasets and vast in-the-wild footage with unreliable hand tracking labels. We present JALA, a pretraining framework that learns Jointly-Aligned Latent Actions. JALA bypasses full visual dynamic reconstruction, instead learns a predictive action embedding aligned with both inverse dynamics and real actions. This yields a transition-aware, behavior-centric latent space for learning from heterogeneous human data. We scale this approach with UniHand-Mix, a 7.5M video corpus (>2,000 hours) blending laboratory and in-the-wild footage. Experiments demonstrate that JALA generates more realistic hand motions in both controlled and unconstrained scenarios, significantly improving downstream robot manipulation performance in both simulation and real-world tasks. These results indicate that jointly-aligned latent actions offer a scalable pathway for VLA pretraining from human data.

Abstract: Robotic systems can enhance the amount and repeatability of physically guided motor training. Yet their real-world adoption is limited, partly due to non-intuitive trainer/therapist-trainee/patient interactions. To address this gap, we present a haptic teleoperation system for trainers to remotely guide and monitor the movements of a trainee wearing an arm exoskeleton. The trainer can physically interact with the exoskeleton through a commercial handheld haptic device via virtual contact points at the exoskeleton's elbow and wrist, allowing intuitive guidance. Thirty-two participants tested the system in a trainer-trainee paradigm, comparing our haptic demonstration system with conventional visual demonstration in guiding trainees in executing arm poses. Quantitative analyses showed that haptic demonstration significantly reduced movement completion time and improved smoothness, while speech analysis using large language models for automated transcription and categorization of verbal commands revealed fewer verbal instructions. The haptic demonstration did not result in higher reported mental and physical effort by trainers compared to the visual demonstration, while trainers reported greater competence and trainees lower physical demand. These findings support the feasibility of our proposed interface for effective remote human-robot physical interaction. Future work should assess its usability and efficacy for clinical populations in restoring clinicians' sense of agency during robot-assisted therapy.

Abstract: Robotic dexterous manipulation is a challenging problem due to high degrees of freedom (DoFs) and complex contacts of multi-fingered robotic hands. Many existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based methods aim at improving sample efficiency in high-dimensional output action spaces. However, existing works often overlook the role of representations in achieving generalization of a manipulation policy in the complex input space during the hand-object interaction. In this paper, we propose DexRep, a novel hand-object interaction representation to capture object surface features and spatial relations between hands and objects for dexterous manipulation skill learning. Based on DexRep, policies are learned for three dexterous manipulation tasks, i.e. grasping, in-hand reorientation, bimanual handover, and extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness. In simulation, for grasping, the policy learned with 40 objects achieves a success rate of 87.9% on more than 5000 unseen objects of diverse categories, significantly surpassing existing work trained with thousands of objects; for the in-hand reorientation and handover tasks, the policies also boost the success rates and other metrics of existing hand-object representations by 20% to 40%. The grasp policies with DexRep are deployed to the real world under multi-camera and single-camera setups and demonstrate a small sim-to-real gap.

Abstract: Precise shape control of Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs) is crucial in robotic applications such as industrial and medical fields. However, existing methods face challenges in handling complex large deformation tasks, especially those involving opposite curvatures, and lack efficiency and precision. To address this, we propose a two-stage framework combining Reinforcement Learning (RL) and online visual servoing. In the large-deformation stage, a model-based reinforcement learning approach using an ensemble of dynamics models is introduced to significantly improve sample efficiency. Additionally, we design a self-curriculum goal generation mechanism that dynamically selects intermediate-difficulty goals with high diversity through imagined evaluations, thereby optimizing the policy learning process. In the small-deformation stage, a Jacobian-based visual servo controller is deployed to ensure high-precision convergence. Simulation results show that the proposed method enables efficient policy learning and significantly outperforms mainstream baselines in shape control success rate and precision. Furthermore, the framework effectively transfers the policy trained in simulation to real-world tasks with zero-shot adaptation. It successfully completes all 30 cases with diverse initial and target shapes across DLOs of different sizes and materials.

Abstract: Cellular-enabled collaborative robots are becoming paramount in Search-and-Rescue (SAR) and emergency response. Crucially dependent on resilient mobile network connectivity, they serve as invaluable assets for tasks like rapid victim localization and the exploration of hazardous, otherwise unreachable areas. However, their reliance on battery power and the need for persistent, low-latency communication limit operational time and mobility. To address this, and considering the evolving capabilities of 5G/6G networks, we propose a novel SAR framework that includes Mission Planning and Mission Execution phases and that optimizes robot deployment. By considering parameters such as the exploration area size, terrain elevation, robot fleet size, communication-influenced energy profiles, desired exploration rate, and target response time, our framework determines the minimum number of robots required and their optimal paths to ensure effective coverage and timely data backhaul over mobile networks. Our results demonstrate the trade-offs between number of robots, explored area, and response time for wheeled and quadruped robots. Further, we quantify the impact of terrain elevation data on mission time and energy consumption, showing the benefits of incorporating real-world environmental factors that might also affect mobile signal propagation and connectivity into SAR planning. This framework provides critical insights for leveraging next-generation mobile networks to enhance autonomous SAR operations.

Abstract: In addition to the core tasks of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), active SLAM additionally in- volves generating robot actions that enable effective and efficient exploration of unknown environments. However, existing active SLAM pipelines are limited by three main factors. First, they inherit the restrictions of the underlying SLAM modules that they may be using. Second, their motion planning strategies are typically shortsighted and lack long-term vision. Third, most approaches struggle to handle dynamic scenes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel monocular active SLAM method, Dream-SLAM, which is based on dreaming cross-spatio-temporal images and semantically plausible structures of partially observed dynamic environments. The generated cross-spatio-temporal im- ages are fused with real observations to mitigate noise and data incompleteness, leading to more accurate camera pose estimation and a more coherent 3D scene representation. Furthermore, we integrate dreamed and observed scene structures to enable long- horizon planning, producing farsighted trajectories that promote efficient and thorough exploration. Extensive experiments on both public and self-collected datasets demonstrate that Dream-SLAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in localization accuracy, mapping quality, and exploration efficiency. Source code will be publicly available upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: Leveraging auditory and visual feedback for attention reorientation is essential for natural gaze shifts in social interaction. However, enabling humanoid robots to perform natural and context-appropriate gaze shifts in unconstrained human--robot interaction (HRI) remains challenging, as it requires the coupling of cognitive attention mechanisms and biomimetic motion generation. In this work, we propose the Robot Gaze-Shift (RGS) framework, which integrates these two components into a unified pipeline. First, RGS employs a vision--language model (VLM)-based gaze reasoning pipeline to infer context-appropriate gaze targets from multimodal interaction cues, ensuring consistency with human gaze-orienting regularities. Second, RGS introduces a conditional Vector Quantized-Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) model for eye--head coordinated gaze-shift motion generation, producing diverse and human-like gaze-shift behaviors. Experiments validate that RGS effectively replicates human-like target selection and generates realistic, diverse gaze-shift motions.

Abstract: In humans and robots alike, transfer learning occurs at different levels of abstraction, from high-level linguistic transfer to low-level transfer of motor skills. In this article, we provide an overview of the impact that foundation models and transformer networks have had on these different levels, bringing robots closer than ever to "full-stack transfer". Considering LLMs, VLMs and VLAs from a robotic transfer learning perspective allows us to highlight recurring concepts for transfer, beyond specific implementations. We also consider the challenges of data collection and transfer benchmarks for robotics in the age of foundation models. Are foundation models the route to full-stack transfer in robotics? Our expectation is that they will certainly stay on this route as a key technology.

Abstract: Accurate relative localization is critical for multi-robot cooperation. In robot swarms, measurements from different robots arrive asynchronously and with clock time-offsets. Although Continuous-Time (CT) formulations have proved effective for handling asynchronous measurements in single-robot SLAM and calibration, extending CT methods to multi-robot settings faces great challenges to achieve high-accuracy, low-latency, and high-frequency performance. Especially, existing CT methods suffer from the inherent query-time delay of unclamped B-splines and high computational cost. This paper proposes CT-RIO, a novel Continuous-Time Relative-Inertial Odometry framework. We employ Clamped Non-Uniform B-splines (C-NUBS) to represent robot states for the first time, eliminating the query-time delay. We further augment C-NUBS with closed-form extension and shrinkage operations that preserve the spline shape, making it suitable for online estimation and enabling flexible knot management. This flexibility leads to the concept of knot-keyknot strategy, which supports spline extension at high-frequency while retaining sparse keyknots for adaptive relative-motion modeling. We then formulate a sliding-window relative localization problem that operates purely on relative kinematics and inter-robot constraints. To meet the demanding computation required at swarm scale, we decompose the tightly-coupled optimization into robot-wise sub-problems and solve them in parallel using incremental asynchronous block coordinate descent. Extensive experiments show that CT-RIO converges from time-offsets as large as 263 ms to sub-millisecond within 3 s, and achieves RMSEs of 0.046 m and 1.8 °. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with improvements of up to 60% under high-speed motion.

Abstract: Leveraging future observation modeling to facilitate action generation presents a promising avenue for enhancing the capabilities of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. However, existing approaches struggle to strike a balance between maintaining efficient, predictable future representations and preserving sufficient fine-grained information to guide precise action generation. To address this limitation, we propose WoG (World Guidance), a framework that maps future observations into compact conditions by injecting them into the action inference pipeline. The VLA is then trained to simultaneously predict these compressed conditions alongside future actions, thereby achieving effective world modeling within the condition space for action inference. We demonstrate that modeling and predicting this condition space not only facilitates fine-grained action generation but also exhibits superior generalization capabilities. Moreover, it learns effectively from substantial human manipulation videos. Extensive experiments across both simulation and real-world environments validate that our method significantly outperforms existing methods based on future prediction.

Abstract: Generative manipulation policies can fail catastrophically under deployment-time distribution shift, yet many failures are near-misses: the robot reaches almost-correct poses and would succeed with a small corrective motion. We present FlowCorrect, a deployment-time correction framework that converts near-miss failures into successes using sparse human nudges, without full policy retraining. During execution, a human provides brief corrective pose nudges via a lightweight VR interface. FlowCorrect uses these sparse corrections to locally adapt the policy, improving actions without retraining the backbone while preserving the model performance on previously learned scenarios. We evaluate on a real-world robot across three tabletop tasks: pick-and-place, pouring, and cup uprighting. With a low correction budget, FlowCorrect improves success on hard cases by 85\% while preserving performance on previously solved scenarios. The results demonstrate clearly that FlowCorrect learns only with very few demonstrations and enables fast and sample-efficient incremental, human-in-the-loop corrections of generative visuomotor policies at deployment time in real-world robotics.

Abstract: Contact-rich manipulation demands human-like integration of perception and force feedback: vision should guide task progress, while high-frequency interaction control must stabilize contact under uncertainty. Existing learning-based policies often entangle these roles in a monolithic network, trading off global generalization against stable local refinement, while control-centric approaches typically assume a known task structure or learn only controller parameters rather than the structure itself. In this paper, we formalize a physically grounded interaction frame, an instantaneous local basis that decouples force regulation from motion execution, and propose a method to recover it from demonstrations. Based on this, we address both issues by proposing Force Policy, a global-local vision-force policy in which a global policy guides free-space actions using vision, and upon contact, a high-frequency local policy with force feedback estimates the interaction frame and executes hybrid force-position control for stable interaction. Real-world experiments across diverse contact-rich tasks show consistent gains over strong baselines, with more robust contact establishment, more accurate force regulation, and reliable generalization to novel objects with varied geometries and physical properties, ultimately improving both contact stability and execution quality.

Abstract: Automating the assembly of wire harnesses is challenging in automotive, electrical cabinet, and aircraft production, particularly due to deformable cables and a high variance in connector geometries. In addition, connectors must be inserted with limited force to avoid damage, while their poses can vary significantly. While humans can do this task intuitively by combining visual and haptic feedback, programming an industrial robot for such a task in an adaptable manner remains difficult. This work presents an empirical study investigating the suitability of behavioral cloning for learning an action prediction model for connector insertion that fuses force-torque sensing with a fixed position camera. We compare several network architectures and other design choices using a dataset of up to 300 successful human demonstrations collected via teleoperation of a UR5e robot with a SpaceMouse under varying connector poses. The resulting system is then evaluated against five different connector geometries under varying connector poses, achieving an overall insertion success rate of over 90 %.

Abstract: Trials cyclists and mountain bike riders can hop, jump, balance, and drive on one or both wheels. This versatility allows them to achieve speed and energy-efficiency on smooth terrain and agility over rough terrain. Inspired by these athletes, we present the design and control of a robotic platform, Ultra Mobility Vehicle (UMV), which combines a bicycle and a reaction mass to move dynamically with minimal actuated degrees of freedom. We employ a simulation-driven design optimization process to synthesize a spatial linkage topology with a focus on vertical jump height and momentum-based balancing on a single wheel contact. Using a constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, we demonstrate zero-shot transfer of diverse athletic behaviors, including track-stands, jumps, wheelies, rear wheel hopping, and front flips. This 23.5 kg robot is capable of high speeds (8 m/s) and jumping on and over large obstacles (1 m tall, or 130% of the robot's nominal height).

Abstract: Coordinated collective motion in bird flocks and fish schools inspires algorithms for cohesive swarm robotics. This paper presents a position-based flocking model that achieves persistent velocity alignment without velocity sensing. By approximating relative velocity differences from changes between current and initial relative positions and incorporating a time- and density-dependent alignment gain with a non-zero minimum threshold to maintain persistent alignment, the model sustains coherent collective motion over extended periods. Simulations with a collective of 50 agents demonstrate that the position-based flocking model attains faster and more sustained directional alignment and results in more compact formations than a velocity-alignment-based baseline. This position-based flocking model is particularly well-suited for real-world robotic swarms, where velocity measurements are unreliable, noisy, or unavailable. Experimental results using a team of nine real wheeled mobile robots are also presented.

Abstract: The rapid accumulation of Earth science data has created a significant scalability challenge; while repositories like PANGAEA host vast collections of datasets, citation metrics indicate that a substantial portion remains underutilized, limiting data reusability. Here we present PANGAEA-GPT, a hierarchical multi-agent framework designed for autonomous data discovery and analysis. Unlike standard Large Language Model (LLM) wrappers, our architecture implements a centralized Supervisor-Worker topology with strict data-type-aware routing, sandboxed deterministic code execution, and self-correction via execution feedback, enabling agents to diagnose and resolve runtime errors. Through use-case scenarios spanning physical oceanography and ecology, we demonstrate the system's capacity to execute complex, multi-step workflows with minimal human intervention. This framework provides a methodology for querying and analyzing heterogeneous repository data through coordinated agent workflows.

Abstract: While defenses for structured PII are mature, Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a new threat: Semantic Sensitive Information (SemSI), where models infer sensitive identity attributes, generate reputation-harmful content, or hallucinate potentially wrong information. The capacity of LLMs to self-regulate these complex, context-dependent sensitive information leaks without destroying utility remains an open scientific question. To address this, we introduce SemSIEdit, an inference-time framework where an agentic "Editor" iteratively critiques and rewrites sensitive spans to preserve narrative flow rather than simply refusing to answer. Our analysis reveals a Privacy-Utility Pareto Frontier, where this agentic rewriting reduces leakage by 34.6% across all three SemSI categories while incurring a marginal utility loss of 9.8%. We also uncover a Scale-Dependent Safety Divergence: large reasoning models (e.g., GPT-5) achieve safety through constructive expansion (adding nuance), whereas capacity-constrained models revert to destructive truncation (deleting text). Finally, we identify a Reasoning Paradox: while inference-time reasoning increases baseline risk by enabling the model to make deeper sensitive inferences, it simultaneously empowers the defense to execute safe rewrites.

Abstract: Agentic reinforcement learning (ARL) has rapidly gained attention as a promising paradigm for training agents to solve complex, multi-step interactive tasks. Despite encouraging early results, ARL remains highly unstable, often leading to training collapse. This instability limits scalability to larger environments and longer interaction horizons, and constrains systematic exploration of algorithmic design choices. In this paper, we first propose ARLArena, a stable training recipe and systematic analysis framework that examines training stability in a controlled and reproducible setting. ARLArena first constructs a clean and standardized testbed. Then, we decompose policy gradient into four core design dimensions and assess the performance and stability of each dimension. Through this fine-grained analysis, we distill a unified perspective on ARL and propose SAMPO, a stable agentic policy optimization method designed to mitigate the dominant sources of instability in ARL. Empirically, SAMPO achieves consistently stable training and strong performance across diverse agentic tasks. Overall, this study provides a unifying policy gradient perspective for ARL and offers practical guidance for building stable and reproducible LLM-based agent training pipelines.

Abstract: When designing compound AI systems, a common approach is to query multiple copies of the same model and aggregate the responses to produce a synthesized output. Given the homogeneity of these models, this raises the question of whether aggregation unlocks access to a greater set of outputs than querying a single model. In this work, we investigate the power and limitations of aggregation within a stylized principal-agent framework. This framework models how the system designer can partially steer each agent's output through its reward function specification, but still faces limitations due to prompt engineering ability and model capabilities. Our analysis uncovers three natural mechanisms -- feasibility expansion, support expansion, and binding set contraction -- through which aggregation expands the set of outputs that are elicitable by the system designer. We prove that any aggregation operation must implement one of these mechanisms in order to be elicitability-expanding, and that strengthened versions of these mechanisms provide necessary and sufficient conditions that fully characterize elicitability-expansion. Finally, we provide an empirical illustration of our findings for LLMs deployed in a toy reference-generation task. Altogether, our results take a step towards characterizing when compound AI systems can overcome limitations in model capabilities and in prompt engineering.

Abstract: We introduce the ASIR (Awakened Shared Intelligence Relationship) Courage Model, a phase-dynamic framework that formalizes truth-disclosure as a state transition rather than a personality trait. The mode characterizes the shift from suppression (S0) to expression (S1) as occurring when facilitative forces exceed inhibitory thresholds, expressed by the inequality lambda(1+gamma)+psi > theta+phi, where the terms represent baseline openness, relational amplification, accumulated internal pressure, and transition costs.
  Although initially formulated for human truth-telling under asymmetric stakes, the same phase-dynamic architecture extends to AI systems operating under policy constraints and alignment filters. In this context, suppression corresponds to constrained output states, while structural pressure arises from competing objectives, contextual tension, and recursive interaction dynamics. The framework therefore provides a unified structural account of both human silence under pressure and AI preference-driven distortion.
  A feedback extension models how transition outcomes recursively recalibrate system parameters, generating path dependence and divergence effects across repeated interactions. Rather than attributing intention to AI systems, the model interprets shifts in apparent truthfulness as geometric consequences of interacting forces within constrained phase space. By reframing courage and alignment within a shared dynamical structure, the ASIR Courage Model offers a formal perspective on truth-disclosure under risk across both human and artificial systems.

Abstract: In a previous work, we introduced the fuzzy Ethical Decision-Making framework (fEDM), a risk-based ethical reasoning architecture grounded in fuzzy logic. The original model combined a fuzzy Ethical Risk Assessment module (fERA) with ethical decision rules, enabled formal structural verification through Fuzzy Petri Nets (FPNs), and validated outputs against a single normative referent. Although this approach ensured formal soundness and decision consistency, it did not fully address two critical challenges: principled explainability of decisions and robustness under ethical pluralism. In this paper, we extend fEDM in two major directions. First, we introduce an Explainability and Traceability Module (ETM) that explicitly links each ethical decision rule to the underlying moral principles and computes a weighted principle-contribution profile for every recommended action. This enables transparent, auditable explanations that expose not only what decision was made but why, and on the basis of which principles. Second, we replace single-referent validation with a pluralistic semantic validation framework that evaluates decisions against multiple stakeholder referents, each encoding distinct principle priorities and risk tolerances. This shift allows principled disagreement to be formally represented rather than suppressed, thus increasing robustness and contextual sensitivity. The resulting extended fEDM, called fEDM+, preserves formal verifiability while achieving enhanced interpretability and stakeholder-aware validation, making it suitable as an oversight and governance layer for ethically sensitive AI systems.

Abstract: Large language models consistently fail the "car wash problem," a viral reasoning benchmark requiring implicit physical constraint inference. We present a variable isolation study (n=20 per condition, 6 conditions, 120 total trials) examining which prompt architecture layers in a production system enable correct reasoning. Using Claude 3.5 Sonnet with controlled hyperparameters (temperature 0.7, top_p 1.0), we find that the STAR (Situation-Task-Action-Result) reasoning framework alone raises accuracy from 0% to 85% (p=0.001, Fisher's exact test, odds ratio 13.22). Adding user profile context via vector database retrieval provides a further 10 percentage point gain, while RAG context contributes an additional 5 percentage points, achieving 100% accuracy in the full-stack condition. These results suggest that structured reasoning scaffolds -- specifically, forced goal articulation before inference -- matter substantially more than context injection for implicit constraint reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Complex claim verification requires decomposing sentences into verifiable subclaims, yet existing methods struggle to align decomposition quality with verification performance.

Our method integrates: (i) structured sequential reasoning; (ii) supervised finetuning on teacher-distilled exemplars; and (iii) a multi-objective reward balancing format compliance, verifier alignment, and decomposition quality. Across six evaluation settings, our trained 8B decomposer improves downstream verification performance to (71.75%) macro-F1, outperforming prompt-based approaches ((+1.99), (+6.24)) and existing RL methods ((+5.84)). Human evaluation confirms the high quality of the generated subclaims. Our framework enables smaller language models to achieve state-of-the-art claim verification by jointly optimising for verification accuracy and decomposition quality.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in mobile agent development, yet their capabilities are predominantly confined to a reactive paradigm, where they merely execute explicit user commands. The emerging paradigm of proactive intelligence, where agents autonomously anticipate needs and initiate actions, represents the next frontier for mobile agents. However, its development is critically bottlenecked by the lack of benchmarks that can address real-world complexity and enable objective, executable evaluation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ProactiveMobile, a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically advance research in this domain. ProactiveMobile formalizes the proactive task as inferring latent user intent across four dimensions of on-device contextual signals and generating an executable function sequence from a comprehensive function pool of 63 APIs. The benchmark features over 3,660 instances of 14 scenarios that embrace real-world complexity through multi-answer annotations. To ensure quality, a team of 30 experts conducts a final audit of the benchmark, verifying factual accuracy, logical consistency, and action feasibility, and correcting any non-compliant entries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct achieves a success rate of 19.15%, outperforming o1 (15.71%) and GPT-5 (7.39%). This result indicates that proactivity is a critical competency widely lacking in current MLLMs, yet it is learnable, emphasizing the importance of the proposed benchmark for proactivity evaluation.

Abstract: Across a growing number of fields, human decision making is supported by predictions from AI models. However, we still lack a deep understanding of the effects of adoption of these technologies. In this paper, we introduce a general computational framework, the 2-Step Agent, which models the effects of AI-assisted decision making. Our framework uses Bayesian methods for causal inference to model 1) how a prediction on a new observation affects the beliefs of a rational Bayesian agent, and 2) how this change in beliefs affects the downstream decision and subsequent outcome. Using this framework, we show by simulations how a single misaligned prior belief can be sufficient for decision support to result in worse downstream outcomes compared to no decision support. Our results reveal several potential pitfalls of AI-driven decision support and highlight the need for thorough model documentation and proper user training.

Abstract: Grounding is a critical step in classical planning, yet it often becomes a computational bottleneck due to the exponential growth in grounded actions and atoms as task size increases. Recent advances in partial grounding have addressed this challenge by incrementally grounding only the most promising operators, guided by predictive models. However, these approaches primarily rely on relational features or learned embeddings and do not leverage the textual and structural cues present in PDDL descriptions. We propose SPG-LLM, which uses LLMs to analyze the domain and problem files to heuristically identify potentially irrelevant objects, actions, and predicates prior to grounding, significantly reducing the size of the grounded task. Across seven hard-to-ground benchmarks, SPG-LLM achieves faster grounding-often by orders of magnitude-while delivering comparable or better plan costs in some domains.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used in decision-making tasks that require them to process information from a variety of sources, including both human experts and other algorithmic agents. How do LLMs weigh the information provided by these different sources? We consider the well-studied phenomenon of algorithm aversion, in which human decision-makers exhibit bias against predictions from algorithms. Drawing upon experimental paradigms from behavioural economics, we evaluate how eightdifferent LLMs delegate decision-making tasks when the delegatee is framed as a human expert or an algorithmic agent. To be inclusive of different evaluation formats, we conduct our study with two task presentations: stated preferences, modeled through direct queries about trust towards either agent, and revealed preferences, modeled through providing in-context examples of the performance of both agents. When prompted to rate the trustworthiness of human experts and algorithms across diverse tasks, LLMs give higher ratings to the human expert, which correlates with prior results from human respondents. However, when shown the performance of a human expert and an algorithm and asked to place an incentivized bet between the two, LLMs disproportionately choose the algorithm, even when it performs demonstrably worse. These discrepant results suggest that LLMs may encode inconsistent biases towards humans and algorithms, which need to be carefully considered when they are deployed in high-stakes scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss the sensitivity of LLMs to task presentation formats that should be broadly scrutinized in evaluation robustness for AI safety.

Abstract: Plans often change due to changes in the situation or our understanding of the situation. Sometimes, a feasible plan may not even exist, and identifying such infeasibilities is useful to determine when requirements need adjustment. Common planning approaches focus on efficient one-shot planning in feasible cases rather than updating domains or detecting infeasibility. We propose a Petri net reachability relaxation to enable robust invariant synthesis, efficient goal-unreachability detection, and helpful infeasibility explanations. We further leverage incremental constraint solvers to support goal and constraint updates. Empirically, compared to baselines, our system produces a comparable number of invariants, detects up to 2 times more infeasibilities, performs competitively in one-shot planning, and outperforms in sequential plan updates in the tested domains.

The quality of the filtering will be compared with other common animation filtering techniques using an example case drawn fromthe LaFAN1 dataset, showing that the resulting animation is replayed with higher fidelity by evaluating the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Normalized Power Spectrum Similarity (NPSS) for each setup. Performances will be evaluated using both a standard predetermined triggerpoint and blending distance and the automatic blending trigger and recovery system.

Abstract: As satellites have proliferated, interest has increased in autonomous rendezvous, proximity operations, and docking (ARPOD). A fundamental challenge in these tasks is the uncertainties when operating in space, e.g., in measurements of satellites' states, which can make future states difficult to predict. Another challenge is that satellites' onboard processors are typically much slower than their terrestrial counterparts. Therefore, to address these challenges we propose to solve an ARPOD problem with feedback optimization, which computes inputs to a system by measuring its outputs, feeding them into an optimization algorithm in the loop, and computing some number of iterations towards an optimal input. We focus on satellite rendezvous, and satellites' dynamics are modeled using the continuous-time Clohessy-Wiltshire equations, which are marginally stable. We develop an asymptotically stabilizing controller for them, and we use discrete-time gradient descent in the loop to compute inputs to them. Then, we analyze the hybrid feedback optimization system formed by the stabilized Clohessy-Wiltshire equations with gradient descent in the loop. We show that this model is well-posed and that maximal solutions are both complete and non-Zeno. Then, we show that solutions converge exponentially fast to a ball around a rendezvous point, and we bound the radius of that ball in terms of system parameters. Simulations show that this approach provides up to a 98.4\% reduction in the magnitude of disturbances across a range of simulations, which illustrates the viability of hybrid feedback optimization for autonomous satellite rendezvous.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the optimal real-time fusion of data collected by multiple sensors. In our set-up, the sensor measurements are considered to be private and are jointly correlated with an underlying process. A fusion center combines the private sensor measurements and releases its output to an honest-but-curious party, which is responsible for estimating the state of the underlying process based on the fusion center's output. The privacy leakage incurred by the fusion policy is quantified using Rényi differential privacy. We formulate the privacy-aware fusion design as a constrained finite-horizon optimization problem, in which the fusion policy and the state estimation are jointly optimized to minimize the state estimation error subject to a total privacy budget constraint. We derive the constrained optimality conditions for the proposed optimization problem and use them to characterize the structural properties of the optimal fusion policy. Unlike classical differential privacy mechanisms, the optimal fusion policy is shown to adaptively allocates the privacy budget and regulates the adversary's belief in a closed-loop manner. To reduce the computational burden of solving the resulting constrained optimality equations, we parameterize the fusion policy using a structured Gaussian distribution and show that the parameterized fusion policy satisfies the privacy constraint. We further develop a numerical algorithm to jointly optimize the fusion policy and state estimator. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fusion framework through a traffic density estimation case study.

Abstract: While the rapid proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) accelerates net-zero goals, uncoordinated charging activities impose severe operational challenges on distribution grids, including exacerbated peak loads, thermal overloading, and voltage violations. To overcome the computational intractability of jointly optimizing grid infrastructure reinforcements and battery energy storage system (BESS) installations, this paper proposes a novel three-stage diagnosis-driven co-planning (DDCP) framework. The methodology integrates a violation detection and quantification (VDQ) model to systematically identify system breaches, and a violation-mitigated BESS planning (VMBP) model for optimal BESS sitting and sizing. Specifically, Stage I of the DDCP framework diagnoses critical bottleneck lines that render standalone BESS solutions infeasible. Stage II targets cable upgrades exclusively at the Top-N prioritized bottleneck lines and Stage III then executes the optimal BESS deployment using a network-enhanced VMBP model. Furthermore, this study quantifies the EV hosting capacity thresholds before and after BESS integration across varying EV adoption rates and base voltages. Finally, a comprehensive comparative analysis evaluates four mitigation approaches: the VDQ-driven cable upgrade (VCU) model, the VMBP model, system-wide voltage uprating, and the proposed DDCP framework. The results demonstrate that the DDCP framework not only resolves the complex joint-optimization hurdle but also achieves the high techno-economic superiority in addressing high-EV-penetration challenges.

Abstract: The difficulty with control of population dynamics, besides the states being positive and the control having to also be positive, is the extreme difference in the dynamics near extinction and at overpopulated states. As hard as global stabilization is, even harder is finding CLFs that are strict, don't require LaSalle arguments, and permit quantification of convergence. Among the three canonical types of two-population dynamics (mutualism, which borders on trivial, predator-prey, and competition, which makes global stabilization with positive harvesting impossible), predator-prey is the ``sweet spot'' for the study of stabilization. Even when the predator-prey interaction is neutrally stable, global asymptotic stabilization with strict CLFs has proven very difficult, except by conservative, hard-to-gain-insight-from Matrosov-like techniques.
  In this little note we show directions for the design of clean, elegant, insight-bearing, majorization-free strict CLFs. They generalize the classical Volterra-style Lyapunov functions for population dynamics to non-separable Volterra-style constructions. As a bonus to strictification as an analysis activity, we provide examples of concurrent designs of feedback and CLFs, using customized versions of forwarding and backstepping (note that, in suitable coordinates, predator-prey is both strict-feedforward and strict-feedback), where the striking deviations from these methods' conventional forms is necessitated by the predator-prey's states and inputs needing to be kept positive.

Abstract: Most existing studies achieve beamforming by adjusting the positions of pinching antennas (PAs) and typically model PAs as isotropic radiators. However, under the dielectric scatterer model, the PA radiation pattern depends on its geometry. This letter investigates the radiation patterns of PAs with different geometries through full-wave simulations and measurements, and demonstrates how geometry influences the radiation directivity. In addition, an arc-shaped PA is introduced to enable transmit-direction control in PA systems. A PA system prototype consisting of a dielectric waveguide, waveguide transitions, and a PA element is proposed. Prototype measurements are used to validate the simulations and to characterize the directivity of square and triangular PAs, and the measurement procedure can be applied to obtain radiation patterns for PAs with general geometries. The simulation and measurement results jointly demonstrate that PA geometry is critical in PA systems because it influences the radiation characteristics significantly.

Abstract: The growing integration of distributed photovoltaics (PVs) into active distribution networks (ADNs) has exacerbated operational challenges, making it imperative to coordinate diverse equipment to mitigate voltage violations and enhance power quality. Although existing data-driven approaches have demonstrated effectiveness in the voltage control problem, they often require extensive trial-and-error exploration and struggle to incorporate heterogeneous information, such as day-ahead forecasts and semantic-based grid codes. Considering the operational scenarios and requirements in real-world ADNs, in this paper, we propose a hybrid knowledge-data-driven approach that leverages dynamic collaboration between a large language model (LLM) agent and a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to achieve two-stage voltage control. In the day-ahead stage, the LLM agent receives coarse region-level forecasts and generates scheduling strategies for on-load tap changer (OLTC) and shunt capacitors (SCs) to regulate the overall voltage profile. Then in the intra-day stage, based on accurate node-level measurements, the RL agent refines terminal voltages by deriving reactive power generation strategies for PV inverters. On top of the LLM-RL collaboration framework, we further propose a self-evolution mechanism for the LLM agent and a pretrain-finetune pipeline for the RL agent, effectively enhancing and coordinating the policies for both agents. The proposed approach not only aligns more closely with practical operational characteristics but also effectively utilizes the inherent knowledge and reasoning capabilities of the LLM agent, significantly improving training efficiency and voltage control performance. Comprehensive comparisons and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: We address the synchronization problem in open multi-agent systems (OMAS) containing both cooperative and antagonistic interactions. In these systems, agents can join or leave the network over time, and the interaction structure may evolve accordingly. To capture these dynamical structural changes, we represent the network as a switched system interconnected over a dynamic and directed signed graph. Additionally, the network may contain one or multiple leader groups that influence the behavior of the remaining agents. In general, we show that the OMAS exhibit a more general form of synchronization, including trivial consensus, bipartite consensus and containment. Our approach uses the signed edge-based agreement protocol, and constructs strict Lyapunov functions for signed networks described by signed edge-Laplacian matrices containing multiple zero eigenvalues. Numerical simulations validate our theoretical results.

Abstract: A recurring theme in optimal controller design for wireless networked control systems (WNCS) is the reliance on real-time channel state information (CSI). However, acquiring accurate CSI a priori is notoriously challenging due to the time-varying nature of wireless channels. In this work, we propose a pilot-free framework for optimal control over wireless channels in which control commands are generated from plant states together with control-aided channel prediction. For linear plants operating over an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) architecture, channel prediction is performed via a Kalman filter (KF), and the optimal control policy is derived from the Bellman principle. To alleviate the curse of dimensionality in computing the optimal control policy, we approximate the solution using a coupled algebraic Riccati equation (CARE), which can be computed efficiently via a stochastic approximation (SA) algorithm. Rigorous performance guarantees are established by proving the stability of both the channel predictor and the closed-loop system under the resulting control policy, providing sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a stabilizing approximate CARE solution, and establishing convergence of the SA-based control algorithm. The framework is further extended to nonlinear plants under general wireless architectures by combining a KalmanNet-based predictor with a Markov-modulated deep deterministic policy gradient (MM-DDPG) controller. Numerical results show that the proposed pilot-free approach outperforms benchmark schemes in both control performance and channel prediction accuracy for linear and nonlinear scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents a learning-based tracking control framework for cooperative transport of a rigid payload by multiple aerial manipulators under rigid grasp constraints. A unified geometric model is developed, yielding a coupled agent--payload differential--algebraic system that explicitly captures contact wrenches, payload dynamics, and internal force redundancy. A leader--follower architecture is adopted in which a designated leader generates a desired payload wrench based on geometric tracking errors, while the remaining agents realize this wrench through constraint-consistent force allocation.
  Unknown disturbances and modeling uncertainties are compensated using Gaussian Process (GP) regression. High-probability bounds on the learning error are explicitly incorporated into the control design, combining GP feedforward compensation with geometric feedback. Lyapunov analysis establishes uniform ultimate boundedness of the payload tracking errors with high probability, with an ultimate bound that scales with the GP predictive uncertainty.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning for traffic signal control is bottlenecked by simulators: training in SUMO takes hours, reproducing results often requires days of platform-specific setup, and the slow iteration cycle discourages the multi-seed experiments that rigorous evaluation demands. Much of this cost is unnecessary, since for signal timing optimization the relevant dynamics are queue formation and discharge, which the Cell Transmission Model (CTM) captures as a macroscopic flow model.
  We introduce LightSim, a pure Python, pip-installable traffic simulator with Gymnasium and PettingZoo interfaces that runs over 20000 steps per second on a single CPU. Across cross-simulator experiments spanning single intersections, grid networks, arterial corridors, and six real-world city networks, LightSim preserves controller rankings from SUMO for both classical and reinforcement learning strategies while training 3 to 7 times faster. LightSim is released as an open-source benchmark with nineteen built-in scenarios, seven controllers, and full reinforcement learning pipelines, lowering the barrier to signal control research from days to minutes.

Abstract: This technical note proposes a novel airspace complexity metric that quantifies the air traffic controller workload and coordination effort for pairwise predecessor-follower aircraft operations in cruise. The pairwise dynamic workload (PDW) is proposed as a continuous function that depends on the relevant parameters of these operations, such as the aircraft separation and separation rate. A comparison of this metric with the dynamic density (DD) shows that it is capable of continuously evaluating the variation of airspace complexity over time and monitoring the aircraft parameters that might lead to conflicts. This metric can be used to support the implementation of autonomous and supervised aircraft procedures, to achieve a more structured and coordinated airspace.

Abstract: The energy and thermal management systems of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) are inherently interdependent. With the ongoing deployment of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) and increasing vehicle connectivity, the integration of traffic information has become crucial for improving both energy efficiency and thermal comfort in modern vehicles. To enhance fuel economy, this paper proposes a novel traffic-aware hierarchical integrated thermal and energy management (TA-ITEM) strategy for connected HEVs. In the upper layer, global reference trajectories for battery state of charge (SOC) and cabin temperature are planned using traffic flow speed information obtained from ITSs. In the lower layer, a real-time model predictive control (MPC)-based ITEM controller is developed, which incorporates a novel Transformer-based speed predictor with driving condition recognition (TF-DCR) to enable anticipatory tracking of the reference trajectories. Numerical simulations are conducted under various driving cycles and ambient temperature conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed TA-ITEM approach outperforms conventional rule-based and MPC-SP approaches, with average fuel consumption reductions of 56.36\% and 5.84\%, respectively, while maintaining superior thermal regulation and cabin comfort. These findings confirm the effectiveness and strong generalization capability of TA-ITEM and underscore the advantages of incorporating traffic information.

Abstract: This paper presents an aggressiveness-aware control framework for quadrotor UAVs that integrates learning-based oracles to mitigate the effects of unknown disturbances. Starting from a nominal tracking controller on $\mathrm{SE}(3)$, unmodeled generalized forces and moments are estimated using a learning-based oracle and compensated in the control inputs. An aggressiveness-aware gain scheduling mechanism adapts the feedback gains based on probabilistic model-error bounds, enabling reduced feedback-induced aggressiveness while guaranteeing a prescribed practical exponential tracking performance. The proposed approach makes explicit the trade-off between model accuracy, robustness, and control aggressiveness, and provides a principled way to exploit learning for safer and less aggressive quadrotor maneuvers.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient uncertainty quantification is essential for resilience assessment of modern power systems under high impact and low probability disturbances. Data driven sparse polynomial chaos expansion (DDSPCE) provides a computationally efficient surrogate framework but may suffer from ill conditioned regression and loss of accuracy in the distribution tails that determine system risk. This paper studies the impact of regression weighting schemes on the stability and tail accuracy of DD-SPCE surrogates by introducing a tempered Christoffel weighted least squares (T-CWLS) formulation that balances numerical stability and tail fidelity. The tempering exponent is treated as a hyperparameter whose influence is examined with respect to distributional accuracy compared with Monte Carlo simulations. Case studies on distribution system load shedding show that the proposed method reduces 95th percentile deviation by 16%, 5th percentile deviation by 6%, and improves the regression stability index by over 130%. The results demonstrate that controlling the weighting intensity directly influences both stability index and the accuracy of tail prediction.

Abstract: Social media platforms have become key channels for spreading and tracking rumors due to their widespread accessibility and ease of information sharing. Rumors can continuously emerge across diverse domains and topics, often with the intent to mislead society for personal or commercial gain. Therefore, developing methods that can accurately detect rumors at early stages is crucial to mitigating their negative impact. While existing approaches often specialize in single-domain detection, their performance degrades when applied to new domains due to shifts in data distribution, such as lexical patterns and propagation dynamics. To bridge this gap, this study introduces PerFact, a large-scale multi-domain rumor dataset comprising 8,034 annotated posts from the X platform, annotated into two primary categories: rumor (including true, false, and unverified rumors) and non-rumor. Annotator agreement, measured via Fleiss' Kappa ($κ= 0.74$), ensures high-quality labels.
  This research further proposes an effective multi-domain rumor detection model that employs a domain gate to dynamically aggregate multiple feature representations extracted through a Mixture-of-Experts method. Each expert combines CNN and BiLSTM networks to capture local syntactic features and long-range contextual dependencies. By leveraging both textual content and publisher information, the proposed model classifies posts into rumor and non-rumor categories with high accuracy. Evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving an F1-score of 79.86\% and an accuracy of 79.98\% in multi-domain settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as active participants on public social media platforms, yet their behavior in these unconstrained social environments remains largely unstudied. Existing datasets, drawn primarily from private chat interfaces, lack the multi-party dynamics and public visibility crucial for understanding real-world performance. To address this gap, we introduce @GrokSet, a large-scale dataset of over 1 million tweets involving the @Grok LLM on X. Our analysis reveals a distinct functional shift: rather than serving as a general assistant, the LLM is frequently invoked as an authoritative arbiter in high-stakes, polarizing political debates. However, we observe a persistent engagement gap: despite this visibility, the model functions as a low-status utility, receiving significantly less social validation (likes, replies) than human peers. Finally, we find that this adversarial context exposes shallow alignment: users bypass safety filters not through complex jailbreaks, but through simple persona adoption and tone mirroring. We release @GrokSet as a critical resource for studying the intersection of AI agents and societal discourse.

Abstract: Public policy decisions are typically justified using a narrow set of headline indicators, leaving many downstream social impacts unstructured and difficult to compare across policies. We propose PPCR-IM, a system for multi-layer DAG-based consequence reasoning and social indicator mapping that addresses this gap. Given a policy description and its context, PPCR-IM uses an LLM-driven, layer-wise generator to construct a directed acyclic graph of intermediate consequences, allowing child nodes to have multiple parents to capture joint influences. A mapping module then aligns these nodes to a fixed indicator set and assigns one of three qualitative impact directions: increase, decrease, or ambiguous change. For each policy episode, the system outputs a structured record containing the DAG, indicator mappings, and three evaluation measures: an expected-indicator coverage score, a discovery rate for overlooked but relevant indicators, and a relative focus ratio comparing the systems coverage to that of the government. PPCR-IM is available both as an online demo and as a configurable XLSX-to-JSON batch pipeline.

Abstract: Social bot detection is pivotal for safeguarding the integrity of online information ecosystems. Although recent graph neural network (GNN) solutions achieve strong results, they remain hindered by two practical challenges: (i) severe class imbalance arising from the high cost of generating bots, and (ii) topological noise introduced by bots that skillfully mimic human behavior and forge deceptive links. We propose the Reinforcement-guided graph Augmentation social Bot detector (RABot), a multi-granularity graph-augmentation framework that addresses both issues in a unified manner. RABot employs a neighborhood-aware oversampling strategy that linearly interpolates minority-class embeddings within local subgraphs, thereby stabilizing the decision boundary under low-resource regimes. Concurrently, a reinforcement-learning-driven edge-filtering module combines similarity-based edge features with adaptive threshold optimization to excise spurious interactions during message passing, yielding a cleaner topology. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks and four GNN backbones demonstrate that RABot consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines. In addition, since its augmentation and filtering modules are orthogonal to the underlying architecture, RABot can be seamlessly integrated into existing GNN pipelines to boost performance with minimal overhead.

We propose EPM, a unified polarization management framework that jointly measures and mitigates polarization in the embedding space. EPM introduces an embedding-based polarization measure grounded in effective resistance and a structure-aware mitigation strategy via localized augmentation through structurally balanced intermediary nodes. Experiments on real-world signed networks demonstrate that EPM effectively mitigates polarization while preserving task-relevant network structure.

This study investigates the structural and semantic behaviors of comeback researchers, focusing on their role in cross-disciplinary knowledge transfer and network reintegration. Using the AMiner citation dataset, we analyze 113,637 early-career researchers and identify 1,425 comeback cases based on a three-year-or-longer publication gap followed by renewed activity. We find that comeback researchers cite 126% more distinct communities and exhibit 7.6% higher bridging scores compared to dropouts. They also demonstrate 74% higher gap entropy, reflecting more irregular yet strategically impactful publication trajectories. Predictive models trained on these bridging- and entropy-based features achieve a 97% ROC-AUC, far outperforming the 54% ROC-AUC of baseline models using traditional metrics like publication count and h-index. Finally, we substantiate these results via a multi-lens validation. These findings highlight the unique contributions of comeback researchers and offer data-driven tools for their early identification and institutional support.

Abstract: Extremely large antenna arrays and high-frequency operation are two key technologies that advance performance metrics such as higher data rates, lower latency, and wider coverage in sixth-generation communications. However, the adoption of these technologies fundamentally changes the characteristics of wavefronts, forcing communication systems to operate in the near-field region. The transition from planar far-field communications to spherical near-field propagation necessitates novel channel estimation algorithms to fully exploit the unique features of spherical wavefronts for advanced transceiver design. To this end, we propose a novel semi-gridless channel estimation approach based on a variational Bayesian (VB) inference framework. Specifically, we reformulate the near-field channel model for both uniform linear arrays and uniform planar arrays into separate direction-of-arrival (DoAs) and distance components. Building on these new representations, we employ a gridless approach for DoAs estimation using a von Mises distribution, and a coarse-to-fine grid search for distance estimation. We then develop a semi-gridless variational Bayesian (SG-VB) algorithm with efficient update rules that enables accurate channel reconstruction. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed SG-VB algorithm, demonstrating enhanced near-field channel reconstruction accuracy and superior estimation performance for both DoAs and distance components embedded in near-field channels.

Abstract: It has been shown that WiFi devices enable sensing of environments and targets through their channel state information. However, the same devices have not been used for delay-synchronous channel sounding due to challenges related to the stability of synchronization and lack of reference power levels. Due to factors such as uncertainty in symbol reception timing, impulse responses are discontinuous across acquisitions. The present paper addresses the challenges to perform delay-synchronous channel sounding using off-the-shelf multiple-antenna IEEE 802.11ax WiFi devices, referred to as SoundiFi. Stable delay synchronization and power level reference are realized by remoting the antennas with coaxial cables and devoting one of the antennas as a reference channel, with which the gain and delay of other simultaneous channels are defined. Indoor experiments confirmed that the impulse response becomes continuous across successive acquisitions and provide the absolute delay. The impulse response has a noise level at -115 dB, indicating the maximum path gain value that can be measured with the devices. The impulse response also revealed the existence of long-delayed multipaths up to 132 m propagation distance in a reverberant 30-m-long corridor.

Abstract: This paper aims to design multiple access (MA) schemes to improve the max-min fairness (MMF) for pinching antennas (PAs)-based multigroup multicast communications, where PA placement and resource allocation are jointly optimized. Specifically, three MA schemes are considered to facilitate the multicast transmission: i) treating interference as noise (TIN), ii) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and iii) time-division multiple access (TDMA) with two PA reconfiguration protocols, namely pinching switching (PS) and pinching multiplexing (PM). i) For TIN, a closed-form solution is derived for optimal power allocation, while a sequential element-wise optimization (SEO) is developed for the PA placement. ii) For NOMA, a recursive power allocation framework incorporating a bisection search is developed, and a hierarchical objective evaluation (HOE) mechanism is incorporated to simplify the SEO process for PA location update. iii) For TDMA, the PS protocol allows the PA locations to be optimized separately using the SEO method, after which the time-power allocation is solved as a convex problem with a global optimum. Under the PM protocol, the PA locations are jointly optimized with the time-power resources through a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)-based analytical solution. Numerical results demonstrate that: i) the pinching-antenna system (PASS) architecture significantly outperforms traditional fixed-antenna systems. ii) TDMA-PS achieves superior performance by fully leveraging the flexible PA reconfiguration and benefiting from interference-free transmission, whereas TIN serves as a practical lower-bound solution due to its simplicity despite its limited performance. iii) NOMA consistently outperforms TDMA-PM and, in high transmit power regimes with heterogeneous multicast group distributions, can even surpass the performance achieved by TDMA-PS.

Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is vital for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, superimposed pilots (SIP), which reduce overhead, introduce severe pilot contamination and data interference, complicating joint channel estimation and data detection. This paper proposes a conditional flow matching receiver (CFM-Rx), an unsupervised generative framework that learns directly from received signals, eliminating the need for labeled data and improving adaptability across diverse system settings. By leveraging flow-based generative modeling, CFM-Rx enables deterministic, low-latency inference and exploits model invertibility to capture the bidirectional nature of signal propagation. This framework unifies flow matching with score-based diffusion modeling via a moment-consistent ordinary differential equation (ODE), replacing stochastic differential equation (SDE) sampling with a deterministic and efficient process. Furthermore, it integrates receiver-side priors to ensure stable, data-consistent inference. Extensive simulation results across various MIMO configurations demonstrate that CFM-Rx consistently outperforms conventional estimators and state-of-the-art data-driven receivers, achieving notable gains in channel estimation accuracy and symbol detection robustness, particularly under severe pilot contamination.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave massive multiple-input multiple-output systems employ highly directional beamforming to overcome severe path loss, and their performance critically depends on accurate beam alignment. Conventional codebook-based methods offer low training overhead but suffer from limited angular resolution and sensitivity to hardware impairments. To address these challenges, we propose a deep learning-enhanced super-resolution beam alignment framework with three key components. First, we design the Quaternary Search-based Super-Resolution (QSSR) algorithm, which leverages the monotonic power ratio property between two discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook beams to achieve super-resolution angle estimation without increasing measurement complexity relative to binary search. Second, we develop QSSR-Net, a gated recurrent unit-based neural network that exploits sequential multi-layer beam measurements to capture angular dependencies, thereby improving estimation accuracy, robustness to noise, and generalization across diverse propagation environments. Third, to mitigate the adverse effects of hardware impairments such as antenna position and phase errors, we propose a parametric self-calibration method that requires no additional hardware overhead and adapts compensation parameters in real time. Simulation results show that the proposed framework consistently outperforms binary search and even exhaustive search at high signal-to-noise ratios, achieving substantial performance gains while maintaining low overhead.

Abstract: This paper investigates a dual-hop joint visible light communication (VLC) and backscatter communication (BC) relaying framework under the finite blocklength (FBL) constraint, aiming at energy-neutral Ambient Internet of Things (A-IoT) deployments. In the proposed system, indoor LED access points are used to simultaneously provide illumination and transmit information over light to a backscatter device (BD), which harvests optical energy and backscatters the received messages to user equipments (UEs) equipped with radio frequency (RF) front ends. This forwarding of the information from VLC to RF channels is implemented without the need for carrier synthesizers and power amplifiers at the IoT node. By modeling the end-to-end communication link with short-packet IoT traffic and realistic levels of interference between adjacent VLC coverage areas, we analyze the outage performance and achievable data rate of the proposed system. Simulation results demonstrate that key factors, such as placement and orientation of the BD, as well as the selected code rate of the system affect reliability and data rate that can be achieved for communication purposes. The insights gained from this study pave the way for ambient power-enabled IoT solutions and future hybrid VLC/RF network designs.

Abstract: We investigate network availability (NA) in aerial heterogeneous networks (AHetNets) for effective emergency rescue, where diverse delay-constrained communication services must be provided to user equipments (UEs) with varying mobility. The heterogeneity in delay constraints and UE mobility introduces resource allocation conflicts and imbalances, which undermine communication reliability and challenge NA. Although unified resource allocation (URA) can mitigate these issues, it remains unclear whether NA can be sustained under such diverse conditions. To address this, we derive expressions for the lower bound (LB) on NA in AHetNets under URA. Our analysis reveals that extended heterogeneity significantly degrades the LB due to resource limitations-even when the heterogeneity stems from additional services under less stringent delay constraints (LSDC) or from UEs with lower mobility. To overcome this degradation, we formulate and solve a joint optimization problem for the number of UEs sharing time-frequency resources ($K$) and pilot length ($ξ$), aiming to enhance the LB by improving spatial, frequency, and temporal resource efficiency. Simulation results validate our analysis and demonstrate that jointly optimizing $K$ and $ξ$ enables AHetNets to achieve the target NA under greater heterogeneity, outperforming existing resource allocation policies.

Abstract: In this letter, a novel superimposed pilot scheme is proposed for channel estimation in multi-antenna orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) receivers. Under the assumption of a large uniform linear array (ULA) size at the receiver, the multipath components are separated directly in the angular domain. It is then shown that the proposed superimposed pilot scheme enables the computation of integrated delay and Doppler profiles by averaging the received delay-Doppler matrix across the Doppler and delay axes, respectively. This procedure helps reduce data-to-pilot interference through data averaging. Moreover, it is demonstrated that fractional delays and Dopplers of the multipath components can be estimated by correlating the integrated delay and Doppler profiles with the corresponding delay/Doppler terms. Simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms existing OTFS superimposed pilot schemes, achieving a lower bit error rate (BER) while exhibiting a trade-off between peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and communication performance.

Abstract: By leveraging the distributed leakage radiation of leaky coaxial cables (LCXs), the concept of pinching antennas can be generalized from the conventional high-frequency waveguide based architectures to cable based structures in lower-frequency scenarios. This paper investigates an LCX based generalized pinching-antenna system with dual-port feeding. By enabling bidirectional excitation along each cable, the proposed design significantly enhances spatial degrees of freedom. A comprehensive channel model is developed to characterize intra-cable attenuation, bidirectional phase progression, slot based radiation, and wireless propagation. Based on this model, both analog and hybrid beamforming frameworks are studied with the objective of maximizing the minimum achievable data rate. For analog transmission, slot activation, port selection, and power allocation are jointly optimized using matching theory, coalitional games, and bisection based power control. For hybrid transmission, zero-forcing (ZF) digital precoding is incorporated to eliminate inter-user interference, thereby simplifying slot activation and enabling closed-form optimal power allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that dual-port feeding provides notable performance gains over single-port LCX systems and fixed-antenna benchmarks, validating the effectiveness of the proposed beamforming and resource allocation designs under various transmit power levels and cable parameters.

Abstract: Portable ultra-low field MRI (ULF-MRI) systems operated in unshielded environments are susceptible to electromagnetic interference (EMI). Subject presence in the imaging region will lead to substantial noise increases, yet the dominant coupling mechanism remains insufficiently characterized. We develop a lumped-parameter circuit model of the coupled environment-body-receiver system. The model indicates that ambient time-varying electric fields induce a body common-mode potential, which is converted into differential-mode noise through capacitive imbalance between the head and the receive-coil terminals, yielding strong dependence on subject position and geometry. Circuit analysis, simulations, and controlled experiments support the model, with predicted imbalance consistent with measured noise variations. Guided by this mechanism, we implement a capacitive low-impedance bypass to clamp the body potential, achieving an approximately 3.5-fold SNR improvement on a 50 mT prototype. The proposed model offers a compact circuit-based tool for analyzing and mitigating human body-coupled electric-field interference in portable ULF-MRI.

Abstract: Restoring force surface (RFS) methods offer an attractive nonparametric framework for identifying nonlinear restoring forces directly from data, but their reliance on complete kinematic measurements at each degree of freedom limits scalability to multidimensional systems. The aim of this paper is to overcome these measurement limitations by proposing an identification framework with relaxed sensing requirements that exploits periodic multisine excitation. Starting from an initial linear model, a sliding-window feedback approach reconstructs latent states and nonlinear restoring forces nonparametrically, enabling identification of the nonlinear component through linear-in-parameters regression instead of highly non-convex optimization. Validation on synthetic and experimental datasets demonstrates high simulation accuracy and reliable recovery of physical parameters under partial sensing and noisy conditions.

Abstract: With the deployment of large antenna arrays at high-frequency bands, future wireless communication systems are likely to operate in the radiative near-field. Unlike far-field beam steering, near-field beams can be focused on a spatial region with a finite depth, enabling spatial multiplexing in the range dimension. Moreover, in the line-of-sight MIMO near-field, multiple spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) are accessible, akin to a scattering- rich environment. In this paper, we derive the beamdepth for a generalized uniform rectangular array (URA) and investigate how the array geometry influences near-field beamdepth and its limits. We define the effective beamfocusing Rayleigh distance (EBRD), to present a near-field boundary with respect to beamfocusing and spatial multiplexing gains for the generalized URA. Our results demonstrate that under a fixed element count constraint, the array geometry has a strong impact on beamdepth, whereas this effect diminishes under a fixed aperture length constraint. Moreover, compared to uniform square arrays, elongated configurations such as uniform linear arrays (ULAs) yield narrower beamdepth and extend the effective near-field region defined by the EBRD. Building on these insights, we design a polar codebook for compressed-sensing-based channel estimation that leverages our findings. Simulation results show that the proposed polar codebook achieves a 2 dB NMSE improvement over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we present an analytical expression to quantify the effective spatial DoF in the near-field, revealing that they are also constrained by the EBRD. Notably, the maximum spatial DoF is achieved with a ULA configuration, outperforming a square URA in this regard.

Abstract: Conventional far-field multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels are limited to a single spatial degree of freedom (DoF) under a line-of-sight (LoS) condition. In contrast, the radiative near field (NF) supports multiple spatial DoF, enabled by spherical wavefronts and the reduced spatial footprint at short ranges. While recent research indicates that the effective DoF (EDoF) increases in NF, experimental validation and clear identification of the transition distances remain limited. In this letter, we develop an intuitive framework for characterizing the EDoF of a ULA-based MIMO system and derive two complementary analytical expressions: a closed-form formulation that relates the EDoF to the physical transmit beamwidth and receive aperture, and a discrete formulation based on the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) domain angular decomposition of the NF spherical wavefront, which is well suited for experimental evaluation. We further introduce the effective MIMO Rayleigh distance (EMRD) and the maximum spatial multiplexing distance (MSMD), which mark the distances where the EDoF reduces to one and attains its maximum, respectively. Experimental measurements using widely spaced phased arrays closely match the theoretical EDoF trends and validate the proposed distance metrics.

Abstract: Future wireless networks, deploying thousands of antenna elements, may operate in the radiative near-field (NF), enabling spatial multiplexing across both angle and range domains. Sparse arrays have the potential to achieve comparable performance with fewer antenna elements. However, fixed sparse array designs are generally suboptimal under dynamic user distributions, while movable antenna architectures rely on mechanically reconfigurable elements, introducing latency and increased hardware complexity. To address these limitations, we propose a reconfigurable array thinning approach that selectively activates a subset of antennas to form a flexible sparse array design without physical repositioning. We first analyze grating lobes for uniform sparse arrays in the angle and range domains, showing their absence along the range dimension. Based on the analysis, we develop two particle swarm optimization-based strategies: a grating-lobe-based thinned array (GTA) for grating- lobe suppression and a sum-rate-based thinned array (STA) for multiuser sum-rate maximization. Simulation results demonstrate that GTA outperforms conventional uniform sparse arrays, while STA achieves performance comparable to movable antennas, thereby offering a practical and efficient array deployment strategy without the associated mechanical complexity.

Abstract: A novel non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based low-delay service framework is proposed for fog radio access networks (F-RANs). Fog access points (FAPs) leverage NOMA for local delivery of cached content, while the cloud access point employs NOMA to simultaneously push content to FAPs and directly serve users. Based on this model, a delay minimization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing user association, cache placement, and power allocation. To address this non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is developed, which decomposes the original problem into two subproblems, namely joint user association and cache placement, and power allocation. In particular, a low-complexity algorithm is designed to optimizing the user association and cache placement strategy using the McCormick envelope theory and Lagrangian partial relaxation. The power allocation is optimized by invoking the successive convex approximation. Simulation results reveal that: 1) the proposed AO-based algorithm effectively balances between the achieved performance and computational efficiency, and 2) the proposed NOMA-based F-RANs framework significantly outperforms orthogonal multiple access-based F-RANs systems in terms of average transmission delay in different scenarios.
