We present Hive hash table, a\nhigh-performance, warp-cooperative and dynamically resizable GPU hash table\nthat adapts to varying workloads without global rehashing.\n  Hive hash table makes three key contributions. First, a cache-aligned packed\nbucket layout stores key-value pairs as 64-bit words, enabling coalesced memory\naccess and atomic updates via single-CAS operations. Second, warp-synchronous\nconcurrency protocols - Warp-Aggregated-Bitmask-Claim (WABC) and\nWarp-Cooperative Match-and-Elect (WCME) - reduce contention to one atomic\noperation per warp while ensuring lock-free progress. Third, a\nload-factor-aware dynamic resizing strategy expands or contracts capacity in\nwarp-parallel K-bucket batches using linear hashing, maintaining balanced\noccupancy. To handle insertions under heavy contention, Hive hash table employs\na four-step strategy: replace, claim-and-commit, bounded cuckoo eviction, and\noverflow-stash fallback. This design provides lock-free fast paths and bounded\nrecovery cost under contention determined by a fixed eviction depth, while\neliminating ABA hazards during concurrent updates.\n  Experimental evaluation on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 shows Hive hash table sustains\nload factors up to 95% while delivering 1.5-2x higher throughput than\nstate-of-the-art GPU hash tables (Slab-Hash, DyCuckoo, WarpCore) under mixed\ninsert-delete-lookup workloads.

Yet\nmost LM evaluations focus on problems with well-defined answers and success\ncriteria. This gap exists in part because natural problems involving\nuncertainty are difficult to construct: given that LMs have access to most of\nthe same knowledge as humans, it is non-trivial to design questions for which\nLMs will struggle to produce correct answers, but which humans can answer\nreliably. As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains\npoorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an\nextensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation\ntasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background\ninformation and express predictions as probabilistic priors. We assess these\npriors for accuracy and calibration, quantifying their usefulness relative to\nsamples from the true distribution of interest. Across six frontier LMs, we\nfind that LM-elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident.\nPerformance improves modestly depending on how uncertainty is elicited from the\nmodel, but is largely unaffected by changes in sampling strategy, reasoning\neffort, or prompt design. The OpenEstimate benchmark thus offers a challenging\nevaluation for frontier LMs and a platform for developing models that are\nbetter at probabilistic estimation and reasoning under uncertainty."}

This issue stems from the ill-posed optimization\nin 3DGS.

As this process lacks an explicit constraint on surface\nopacity, the optimization may incorrectly assign transparency to opaque\nregions, resulting in view-inconsistent and falsely transparent.

Although\nother causes of view-inconsistency have been explored recently, false\ntransparency has not been explicitly identified. To the best of our knowledge,\nwe are the first to identify, characterize, and develop solutions for this\nartifact, an underreported artifact in 3DGS. Our strategy, NGS, encourages\nsurface Gaussians to adopt higher opacity by injecting opaque noise Gaussians\nin the object volume during training, requiring only minimal modifications to\nthe existing splatting process.

Incorporating Optimal Transport (OT) to couple noise and\ndata during FGM training has been shown to improve the straightness of flow\ntrajectories, enabling more effective inference. However, existing OT-based\nmethods estimate the OT plan using (mini-)batches of sampled noise and data\npoints, which limits their scalability to large and high-dimensional datasets\nin FGMs. This paper introduces AlignFlow, a novel approach that leverages\nSemi-Discrete Optimal Transport (SDOT) to enhance the training of FGMs by\nestablishing an explicit, optimal alignment between noise distribution and data\npoints with guaranteed convergence. SDOT computes a transport map by\npartitioning the noise space into Laguerre cells, each mapped to a\ncorresponding data point. During FGM training, i.i.d. noise samples are paired\nwith data points via the SDOT map. AlignFlow scales well to large datasets and\nmodel architectures with negligible computational overhead. Experimental\nresults show that AlignFlow improves the performance of a wide range of\nstate-of-the-art FGM algorithms and can be integrated as a plug-and-play\ncomponent.

Yet the archival record is incomplete: for\nthe first tournament only a report survives, and for the second the submitted\nFortran strategies remain but not the final tournament code. This gap raises\nquestions about the reproducibility of these historically influential results.\nWe recreate the second tournament by restoring the surviving Fortran\nimplementations to compile with modern compilers and by building a Python\ninterface that calls the original strategy functions without modification.\nUsing the open-source Axelrod-Python library to run tournaments, we reproduce\nAxelrod's main findings: TFT prevails, and successful play tends to be\ncooperative, responsive to defection, and willing to forgive. Strategy rankings\nremain mostly unchanged. We then assess the robustness of the originally\nsubmitted strategies by incorporating additional strategies, and we run one of\nthe largest IPD tournaments to date. We find that the original tournament was\nespecially favorable to TFT and that it is difficult to dethrone TFT when the\noriginal submissions make up the majority of the field. We also observe that\nseveral lesser-known submissions perform strongly in more diverse settings and\nunder noise. Our contributions are: (i) the first systematic reproduction of\nAxelrod's second tournament; (ii) a contemporary reassessment of the original\nresults in light of new strategies and settings; and (iii) a preserved,\neasy-to-use implementation of the second-tournament strategies within\nAxelrod-Python to support future research."}

At the 64k GPU scale, we already observed 9%\nGPU time variability for frontier foundation model training. To understand\npotential causes of variability, we analyze GPU microbenchmarks at scale across\na variety of platforms, showing up to 14% variation in GPU performance on GEMM\nworkloads depending on training hardware and deployed environment.\n  Motivated by our analysis and the large design space around performance\nvariability, we present PRISM -- a performance modeling framework that\nconsiders the stochastic nature of the large-scale distributed training. The\ncore of PRISM is the statistical method that provides a quantifiable measure\nfor probabilistic guarantees on training time. Using PRISM, we explore the\ndesign and optimization space of distributed training, from parallelization\nmethods to next-generation training systems. PRISM is validated with\nreal-system measurement, showing training time prediction accuracy with 20.8%\nKolmogorov-Smirnov distance. Using PRISM, we demonstrate that, depending on\ncomputation node placement, up to 1.26x performance improvement potential is\navailable if we factor in sensitivities of parallelization strategies to\nvariation. In addition, we use PRISM to identify kernels to optimize for\nreducing performance variability and predict probability of slow-down for\nlarge-scale jobs where variation is magnified. We find optimizing communication\nkernels, such as AllGather and ReduceScatter, contribute most to minimizing\nvariability in training step time."}

Namely, while the $\\ell_1$-norm is trivially\n$O(1)$-approximable in the RO model, we prove that any algorithm in the RO\nmodel for the fairness-promoting $\\ell_\\infty$-norm must have a competitive\nratio of at least $\\Omega(n^{1/3})$.

In this work, we\ninvestigate the role of prediction in IPP approaches, drawing on the widely\nadopted Val14 benchmark, which encompasses more common driving scenarios with\nrelatively low interaction complexity, and the interPlan benchmark, which\nincludes highly interactive and out-of-distribution driving situations.

Furthermore, we introduce a novel policy\nlearning algorithm for continuous-time LQRs that achieves global linear and\nlocal super-linear convergence. Our results demonstrate both theoretical\nguarantees and algorithmic benefits of transfer learning in continuous-time RL,\naddressing a gap in existing literature and extending prior work from discrete\nto continuous time settings.\n  As a byproduct of our analysis, we derive the stability of a class of\ncontinuous-time score-based diffusion models via their connection with LQRs."}

Analogously to how magnons modulate and transport\nmagnetization, ferrons modulate and transport electric polarization. Here, we\nintroduce multiferrons as elementary excitations with both electric and\nmagnetic character. Multiferrons lead to a tilt and elliptical precession of\nthe polarization and at the same time create a magnetization through the\nmechanism of dynamical multiferroicity. Using first-principles calculations for\nLiNbO$_3$, we show that the electric polarization of multiferrons is\nperpendicular to the equilibrium ferroelectric polarization, whereas the\nmagnetization is parallel to it. Our calculations further demonstrate that\nmultiferrons carry net electric and magnetic quadrupole and octupole moments,\nwhich we term multipolons. These multipolons could couple to internal\nmultipolar degrees of freedom, for example in altermagnets, or to external\nprobes such as neutrons, leading to potentially experimentally observable\nphenomena following coherent or thermal excitation of multiferrons."}

Recent alternatives such as Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) simplify this pipeline by directly optimizing on\npreferences. However, both approaches often assume uniform annotator\npreferences and rely on binary comparisons, overlooking two key limitations:\nthe diversity of human evaluators and the limitations of pairwise feedback. In\nthis work, we address both these issues.

While prior studies\nassess instruction adherence in the model's main responses, we argue that it is\nalso critical for large reasoning models (LRMs) to follow user instructions\nthroughout their reasoning process. Reasoning instruction following makes LRMs\nmore controllable and transparent, while reducing risks of undesirable\nshortcuts, hallucinations, or reward hacking within reasoning traces. To\nevaluate this dimension, we introduce ReasonIF, a systematic benchmark for\nassessing reasoning instruction following. ReasonIF includes six categories of\ninstruction prompts, spanning multilingual reasoning, formatting and length\ncontrol. Across many open-source LRMs including GPT-OSS, Qwen3, and\nDeepSeek-R1, we find substantial failures in reasoning instruction adherence:\nthe highest instruction following score (IFS) remains below 0.25, meaning that\nfewer than $25\\%$ of reasoning traces comply with the given instructions.\nNotably, as task difficulty increases, reasoning instruction following degrades\nfurther. We also explore two strategies to enhance reasoning instruction\nfidelity. (1) multi-turn reasoning and (2) Reasoning Instruction Finetuning\n(RIF) using synthetic data. RIF improves the IFS of $GPT-OSS-20B$ from 0.11 to\n0.27, indicating measurable progress but leaving ample room for improvement."}

This raises a fundamental\nquestion: what microscopic property of pre-trained models leads to this\nvariation? To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses\n(\"if-then\" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via\ncross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition\nprobabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its\nsemantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key\ndiscovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their\ninternal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness\nlevels, becoming highly distinct for \"strict\" versus \"noisy\" rules. In\ncontrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution\nregardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the\nSoundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon\nDivergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that\nSAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical\nlaw (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek)\nand scales (0.5B-14B).

To support systematic study, we propose\nGuessBench, a benchmark with both perception-oriented and knowledge-oriented\nimages for evaluating active reasoning in MLLMs. We evaluate 20 superior MLLMs\nand find that performance on active reasoning lags far behind it on passive\nsettings, indicating substantial room for improvement.

However, current methods\nhave two main drawbacks: (i) recognizability is only partially captured through\nsoft margin constraints, resulting in weaker quality representation and lower\ndiscrimination, especially for low-quality or ambiguous faces; (ii) mutual\noverlapping gradients between feature direction and magnitude introduce\nundesirable interactions during optimization, causing instability and confusion\nin hypersphere planning, which may result in poor generalization, and entangled\nrepresentations where recognizability and identity are not cleanly separated.\nTo address these issues, we introduce a hard margin strategy - Quality Control\nFace (QCFace), which overcomes the mutual overlapping gradient problem and\nenables the clear decoupling of recognizability from identity representation.\nBased on this strategy, a novel hard-margin-based loss function employs a\nguidance factor for hypersphere planning, simultaneously optimizing for\nrecognition ability and explicit recognizability representation. Extensive\nexperiments confirm that QCFace not only provides robust and quantifiable\nrecognizability encoding but also achieves state-of-the-art performance in both\nverification and identification benchmarks compared to existing\nrecognizability-based losses."}

Experiments follow the\ninstruction-induction protocol with matched query budgets across formality\nrewriting, code debugging, and translation. For example, on BIG-Bench\ninformative-to-formal rewriting, accuracy improves from 61.3 +/- 0.7% to\napproximately 85-90%, yielding an absolute gain of about 25-30 points.\nMoreover, auto-debugging shows about +25-point gains under domain shift.\nMeanwhile, stable tasks such as cause-and-effect remain above 96%, indicating\nno loss on in-distribution cases. Furthermore, improvements are consistent\nacross divergence choices and decoding temperatures. Overall, DRO-InstructZero\nconnects distributionally robust optimization with prompt learning, offering a\nplug-and-play and general approach for reliable, transferable prompt alignment\nunder real-world uncertainty."}

This data limitation not only hinders\ngeneralization but also restricts the diversity of motion patterns captured\nduring training. Existing MER studies predominantly rely on simple spatial\naugmentations (e.g., flipping, rotation) and overlook temporal augmentation\nstrategies that can better exploit motion characteristics. To address this gap,\nthis paper proposes a phase-aware temporal augmentation method based on dynamic\nimage. Rather than encoding the entire expression as a single onset-to-offset\ndynamic image (DI), our approach decomposes each expression sequence into two\nmotion phases: onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset.

Framed through the unifying\nperspective of contextual-bandit RL, the work addresses two major application\ndomains - ranking and recommendation, and text-to-image diffusion models. The\nfirst part of the thesis develops theory and algorithms for safe deployment in\nranking systems. An exposure-based generalisation bound is derived, leading to\na counterfactual risk-minimisation objective whose solution is guaranteed not\nto underperform the logging policy, even with sparse feedback. This guarantee\nis extended to doubly robust estimators, enabling safety even under adversarial\nor misspecified user models and offering practitioners explicit control over\npermissible utility loss. The second part turns to single-action bandits, where\nvarious off-policy estimators are unified within a baseline-correction\nframework. A closed-form optimal baseline is proposed and shown to minimise\nboth evaluation and policy-gradient variance, thereby improving off-policy\nlearning reliability. The final part examines the trade-offs between efficiency\nand effectiveness in generative RL. A systematic study of PPO and REINFORCE\nmotivates the Leave-One-Out PPO (LOOP) algorithm, which combines multiple\ndiffusion trajectories with a REINFORCE-style baseline inside PPO's clipped\nobjective. LOOP achieves PPO-level sample efficiency while producing\ngenerations that align more faithfully with textual attributes."}

We estimate the transition\nprobabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its\nsemantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key\ndiscovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their\ninternal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness\nlevels, becoming highly distinct for \"strict\" versus \"noisy\" rules. In\ncontrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution\nregardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the\nSoundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon\nDivergence to measure the separation between these distributions.

Specifically, an f-divergence ball defines an ambiguity set\naround the evaluation distribution, and a robust acquisition rule maximizes\nworst-case expected utility while retaining the query efficiency of Bayesian\nsearch. Therefore, the search explicitly targets reliability under distribution\nshift rather than average behavior alone. Experiments follow the\ninstruction-induction protocol with matched query budgets across formality\nrewriting, code debugging, and translation.

This leads to\ngaps in data representation, feature integration, and task-level multimodal\ncapabilities. To this end, we propose a multi-level framework that draws\ninspiration from diagnostic workflows through the\nObservation-Knowledge-Analysis (OKA) paradigm.

Yet\nmost LM evaluations focus on problems with well-defined answers and success\ncriteria. This gap exists in part because natural problems involving\nuncertainty are difficult to construct: given that LMs have access to most of\nthe same knowledge as humans, it is non-trivial to design questions for which\nLMs will struggle to produce correct answers, but which humans can answer\nreliably. As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains\npoorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an\nextensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation\ntasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background\ninformation and express predictions as probabilistic priors. We assess these\npriors for accuracy and calibration, quantifying their usefulness relative to\nsamples from the true distribution of interest. Across six frontier LMs, we\nfind that LM-elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident.\nPerformance improves modestly depending on how uncertainty is elicited from the\nmodel, but is largely unaffected by changes in sampling strategy, reasoning\neffort, or prompt design. The OpenEstimate benchmark thus offers a challenging\nevaluation for frontier LMs and a platform for developing models that are\nbetter at probabilistic estimation and reasoning under uncertainty."}

This issue stems from the ill-posed optimization\nin 3DGS. During training, background and foreground Gaussians are blended via\nalpha-compositing and optimized solely against the input RGB images using a\nphotometric loss. As this process lacks an explicit constraint on surface\nopacity, the optimization may incorrectly assign transparency to opaque\nregions, resulting in view-inconsistent and falsely transparent. This issue is\ndifficult to detect in standard evaluation settings but becomes particularly\nevident in object-centric reconstructions under interactive viewing. Although\nother causes of view-inconsistency have been explored recently, false\ntransparency has not been explicitly identified. To the best of our knowledge,\nwe are the first to identify, characterize, and develop solutions for this\nartifact, an underreported artifact in 3DGS.

In this paper, we propose a\nlearning-based architecture for managing machine learning workloads in\nheterogeneous clusters. The system operates online, allocating resources to\nincoming training or inference requests while minimizing energy consumption and\nmeeting performance requirements. It uses two neural networks: the first\nprovides initial estimates of how well a new model will utilize different\nhardware types and how it will affect co-located models. An optimizer then\nallocates resources based on these estimates. After deployment, the system\nmonitors real performance and uses this data to refine its predictions via a\nsecond neural network. This updated model improves estimates not only for the\ncurrent hardware but also for hardware not initially allocated and for\nco-location scenarios not yet observed. The result is an adaptive, iterative\napproach that learns over time to make more effective resource allocation\ndecisions in heterogeneous deep learning clusters."}

When obtaining fine\nannotations is difficult or expensive, it may be possible to acquire coarse\nannotations, e.g. by roughly annotating pixels in an images leaving some pixels\naround the boundaries between classes unlabeled. Segmentation with coarse\nannotations is difficult, in particular when the objective is to optimize the\nalignment of boundaries between classes. This paper proposes a regularization\nmethod for models with an encoder-decoder architecture with superpixel based\nupsampling. It encourages the segmented pixels in the decoded image to be\nSLIC-superpixels, which are based on pixel color and position, independent of\nthe segmentation annotation. The method is applied to FCN-16 fully\nconvolutional network architecture and evaluated on the SUIM, Cityscapes, and\nPanNuke data sets. It is shown that the boundary recall improves significantly\ncompared to state-of-the-art models when trained on coarse annotations."}

Gruber", "Adam Tauman Kalai"], "title": "On Non-interactive Evaluation of Animal Communication Translators", "comment": null, "summary": "If you had an AI Whale-to-English translator, how could you validate whether\nor not it is working? Does one need to interact with the animals or rely on\ngrounded observations such as temperature? We provide theoretical and\nproof-of-concept experimental evidence suggesting that interaction and even\nobservations may not be necessary for sufficiently complex languages. One may\nbe able to evaluate translators solely by their English outputs, offering\npotential advantages in terms of safety, ethics, and cost. This is an instance\nof machine translation quality evaluation (MTQE) without any reference\ntranslations available. A key challenge is identifying ``hallucinations,''\nfalse translations which may appear fluent and plausible. We propose using\nsegment-by-segment translation together with the classic NLP shuffle test to\nevaluate translators. The idea is to translate animal communication, turn by\nturn, and evaluate how often the resulting translations make more sense in\norder than permuted. Proof-of-concept experiments on data-scarce human\nlanguages and constructed languages demonstrate the potential utility of this\nevaluation methodology. These human-language experiments serve solely to\nvalidate our reference-free metric under data scarcity. It is found to\ncorrelate highly with a standard evaluation based on reference translations,\nwhich are available in our experiments. We also perform a theoretical analysis\nsuggesting that interaction may not be necessary nor efficient in the early\nstages of learning to translate."}

We propose a lightweight\nDisentangled Concept Bottleneck Model (LDCBM) that automatically groups visual\nfeatures into semantically meaningful components without region annotation. By\nintroducing a filter grouping loss and joint concept supervision, our method\nimproves the alignment between visual patterns and concepts, enabling more\ntransparent and robust decision-making. Notably, Experiments on three diverse\ndatasets demonstrate that LDCBM achieves higher concept and class accuracy,\noutperforming previous CBMs in both interpretability and classification\nperformance.
