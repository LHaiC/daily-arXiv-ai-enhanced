This work\nintroduces TAPA (Training-free Adaptation of Programmatic Agents), a novel\nframework that positions large language models (LLMs) as intelligent moderators\nof the symbolic action space. Unlike prior programmatic agents that typically\ngenerate a monolithic policy program or rely on fixed symbolic action sets,\nTAPA synthesizes and adapts modular programs for individual high-level actions,\nreferred to as logical primitives.

Extensive experiments across\ncybersecurity and swarm intelligence domains validate TAPA's effectiveness. In\nautonomous DDoS defense scenarios, TAPA achieves 77.7% network uptime while\nmaintaining near-perfect detection accuracy in unknown dynamic environments.

Sheppard (ads.), CRC Press, 2025", "summary": "This chapter serves as an introduction to systems engineering focused on the\nbroad issues surrounding realizing complex integrated systems. What is a\nsystem? We pose a number of possible definitions and perspectives, but leave\nopen the opportunity to consider the system from the target context where it\nwill be used. Once we have a system in mind, we acknowledge the fact that this\nsystem needs to integrate a variety of pieces, components, subsystems, in order\nfor it to accomplish its task. Therefore, we concern ourselves at the\nboundaries and interfaces of different technologies and disciplines to\ndetermine how best to achieve that integration. Next we raise the specter that\nthis integrated system is complex. Complexity can be defined in a number of\nways. For one, the sheer number of subsystems or components can be a measure of\ncomplexity. We could also consider the functions being performed by the system\nand how those functions interact with one another. Further, we could consider\ncomputational aspects such as the time or memory that may be needed to\naccomplish one or more tasks. The extent to which new behaviors might emerge\nfrom the system can also be regarded as an element of complexity. In the end,\ncomplexity is that characteristic of a system that defines the associated\nchallenges along the life of the system, so we are concerned with how to manage\nthat complexity. Finally, realization refers to the process by which our\ncomplex integrated system moves from concept to deployment and subsequent\nsupport. It refers to the entire design, development, manufacture, deployment,\noperation, and support life cycle. Of particular note here, however, is that we\nfocus on systems that, by their very nature, are complex. In other words, we\nare interested in large, complicated, interacting beasts that are intended to\nperform difficult tasks and meet a wide variety of end-user needs."}

Graphyne could be a promising candidate due to its unique\nlattice geometry, valley-structured electronic bands, and thermal transport\ncapabilities. However, chiral phonons in graphyne remain unexplored owing to\nthe existence of inversion ($\\mathscr{P}$) and time-reversal ($\\mathscr{T}$)\nsymmetries.

For instance, while existing results for static\nwakeup have polylogarithmic-in-$n$ latency, they can incur additional latency\nthat is {\\it linear} in the cost of a collision $C$. Thus, the total latency is\nlarge and dominated by the contributions from collisions.\n  Here, we design and analyze a randomized wakeup algorithm, Aim-High. For\nsufficiently large $C$ and with bounded error, Aim-High has latency and\nexpected collision cost that is nearly $O(\\sqrt{C})$ for both the static and\ndynamic versions. Otherwise, the latency and expected collision cost are\n$O(\\texttt{poly}{(\\log n)})$ for the static setting, and\n$O(n\\,\\texttt{poly}{(\\log n)})$ for the dynamic setting. We also establish\nlower bounds that complement these results."}

To address this, we introduce a novel\nframework for multi-agent algorithmic recourse that accounts for multiple\nrecourse seekers and recourse providers. We model this many-to-many interaction\nas a capacitated weighted bipartite matching problem, where matches are guided\nby both recourse cost and provider capacity.

One class of Markov chains in wide use aims to sample\nfrom balanced tree-weighted $k$-partitions using a sampler for balanced\ntree-weighted 2-partitions. Previous implementations of this 2-partition\nsampler would draw a random spanning tree and check whether it contains an edge\nwhose removal produces a balanced 2-component forest; if it does, this\n2-partition is accepted, otherwise the algorithm rejects and repeats. In\npractice, this is a significant computational bottleneck.\n  We show that in fact it is possible to sample from the balanced tree-weighted\n2-partition distribution directly, without first sampling a spanning tree; the\nacceptance and rejection rates are the same as in previous samplers. We prove\nthat on a wide class of planar graphs encompassing network structures typically\narising from the geographic data used in computational redistricting, our\nalgorithm takes expected linear time $O(n)$. Notably, this is asymptotically\nfaster than the best known method to generate random trees, which is $O(n\n\\log^2 n)$ for approximate sampling and $O(n^{1 + \\log \\log \\log n / \\log \\log\nn})$ for exact sampling. Additionally, we show that a variant of our algorithm\nalso gives a speedup to $O(n \\log n)$ for exact sampling of uniformly random\ntrees on these families of graphs, improving the bounds for both exact and\napproximate sampling."}

Many existing methods treat posts independently\nand fail to capture the event-level structure that connects them across time\nand modality. We propose E-CaTCH, an interpretable and scalable framework for\nrobustly detecting misinformation. If needed, E-CaTCH clusters posts into\npseudo-events based on textual similarity and temporal proximity, then\nprocesses each event independently. Within each event, textual and visual\nfeatures are extracted using pre-trained BERT and ResNet encoders, refined via\nintra-modal self-attention, and aligned through bidirectional cross-modal\nattention. A soft gating mechanism fuses these representations to form\ncontextualized, content-aware embeddings of each post. To model temporal\nevolution, E-CaTCH segments events into overlapping time windows and uses a\ntrend-aware LSTM, enhanced with semantic shift and momentum signals, to encode\nnarrative progression over time. Classification is performed at the event\nlevel, enabling better alignment with real-world misinformation dynamics. To\naddress class imbalance and promote stable learning, the model integrates\nadaptive class weighting, temporal consistency regularization, and hard-example\nmining.

Ensuring correct behavior often requires\ninserting synchronization primitives such as memory fences ($F$) or atomic\nread-modify-write ($RMW$) operations, but this approach can incur significant\nperformance costs. In this work, we develop a semantic framework that precisely\ncharacterizes when such synchronization is necessary under TSO. We introduce a\nnovel TSO-specific occurs-before relation, which adapts Lamport's celebrated\nhappens-before relation from asynchronous message-passing systems to the TSO\nsetting. Our main result is a theorem that proves that the only way to ensure\nthat two events that take place at different sites are temporally ordered is by\nhaving the execution create an occurs-before chain between the events.

While vision-language\nmodels (VLMs) recently have dramatically improved the semantic accuracy of\npseudo-labels, their geometric quality, particularly bounding box precision,\nremains commonly neglected.To address this issue, we propose a High Box Quality\nOpen-Vocabulary 3D Detection (HQ-OV3D) framework, dedicated to generate and\nrefine high-quality pseudo-labels for open-vocabulary classes. The framework\ncomprises two key components: an Intra-Modality Cross-Validated (IMCV) Proposal\nGenerator that utilizes cross-modality geometric consistency to generate\nhigh-quality initial 3D proposals, and an Annotated-Class Assisted (ACA)\nDenoiser that progressively refines 3D proposals by leveraging geometric priors\nfrom annotated categories through a DDIM-based denoising mechanism.Compared to\nthe state-of-the-art method, training with pseudo-labels generated by our\napproach achieves a 7.37% improvement in mAP on novel classes, demonstrating\nthe superior quality of the pseudo-labels produced by our framework.

The\nmodel with quantum two-level systems enables the processes of spontaneous\nemission, stimulated absorption, and stimulated emission. Equilibrium and\nnonequilibrium regimes depend on competition between pumping and thermal\nrelaxation rates. Strong light-matter interaction and photon decay govern\ndynamics and steady states. In equilibrium, with a high thermal relaxation\nrate, photon numbers are initially determined by spontaneous emission and later\nstabilize due to stimulated absorption, influenced by light-matter interaction\nstrength.

Among the materials studied, CdTe\nexhibits the highest radiation resistance, similar to CdS.

The method finds the fuel-optimal transfer trajectory by sampling\ncandidate energy ($\\Delta V$) changes for different points on the current and\ndesired orbit, and efficiently computing and evaluating each candidate\ngeodesic, which are equivalent to candidate orbit transfer trajectories via the\nJacobi metric. The method bypasses the known issues of optimization-based\nmethods, e.g., sensitivity to the initial guess, and can be applied to more\ncomplex two-body systems.

While current VQA benchmarks\nconsider a limited set of object property attributes like size, they typically\nblend perception and reasoning, and lack representativeness in terms of\nreasoning and image categories. To this end, we introduce a systematic\nevaluation framework with images of three representative types, three reasoning\nlevels of increasing complexity, and four object property dimensions driven by\nprior work on commonsense reasoning. We develop a procedure to instantiate this\nbenchmark into ORBIT, a multi-level reasoning VQA benchmark for object\nproperties comprising 360 images paired with a total of 1,080 count-based\nquestions. Experiments with 12 state-of-the-art VLMs in zero-shot settings\nreveal significant limitations compared to humans, with the best-performing\nmodel only reaching 40\\% accuracy. VLMs struggle particularly with realistic\n(photographic) images, counterfactual reasoning about physical and functional\nproperties, and higher counts.

Many existing methods treat posts independently\nand fail to capture the event-level structure that connects them across time\nand modality. We propose E-CaTCH, an interpretable and scalable framework for\nrobustly detecting misinformation. If needed, E-CaTCH clusters posts into\npseudo-events based on textual similarity and temporal proximity, then\nprocesses each event independently. Within each event, textual and visual\nfeatures are extracted using pre-trained BERT and ResNet encoders, refined via\nintra-modal self-attention, and aligned through bidirectional cross-modal\nattention. A soft gating mechanism fuses these representations to form\ncontextualized, content-aware embeddings of each post. To model temporal\nevolution, E-CaTCH segments events into overlapping time windows and uses a\ntrend-aware LSTM, enhanced with semantic shift and momentum signals, to encode\nnarrative progression over time.

We argue that planning failures are\nprimarily caused by inaccurate object-level motion predictions, and such\nfailures are often reflected in the form of increased planner uncertainty. To\naddress this, we treat planner uncertainty as a trigger for online evolution,\nusing it as a diagnostic signal to initiate targeted model updates. Rather than\nperforming blind updates, we leverage the planner's agent-agent attention to\nidentify the specific objects that the ego vehicle attends to most, which are\nprimarily responsible for the planning failures. For these critical objects, we\ncompute a targeted self-supervised loss by comparing their predicted waypoints\nfrom the prediction module with their actual future positions, selected from\nthe perception module's outputs with high confidence scores. This loss is then\nbackpropagated to adapt the model online. As a result, our method improves the\nmodel's robustness to environmental changes, leads to more precise motion\npredictions, and therefore enables more accurate and stable planning behaviors.\nExperiments on both cross-region and corrupted variants of the nuScenes dataset\ndemonstrate that EvoPSF consistently improves planning performance under\nchallenging conditions."}

In this paper, we propose\na novel paradigm to design high-order Bayesian network classifiers, by learning\ndistributional representations for feature values, as what has been done in\nword embedding and graph representation learning. The learned distributional\nrepresentations are encoded with the semantic relatedness between different\nfeatures through their observed co-occurrence patterns in training data, which\nthen serve as a hallmark to extrapolate the occurrence probabilities of new\ntest samples.

Most prior approaches rely on\nexplicit object pose tracking or handcrafted visual features, limiting their\ngeneralization to novel objects, robustness to visual disturbances, and the\nability to handle deformable objects. Visuomotor learning offers a promising\nalternative, but deploying it in RAS presents unique challenges, such as low\nsignal-to-noise ratio in visual observations, demands for high safety and\nmillimeter-level precision, as well as the complex surgical environment. This\npaper addresses three key challenges: (i) sim-to-real transfer of visuomotor\npolicies to ex vivo surgical scenes, (ii) visuomotor learning using only a\nsingle stereo camera pair -- the standard RAS setup, and (iii) object-agnostic\ngrasping with a single policy that generalizes to diverse, unseen surgical\nobjects without retraining or task-specific models. We introduce Grasp Anything\nfor Surgery V2 (GASv2), a visuomotor learning framework for surgical grasping.\nGASv2 leverages a world-model-based architecture and a surgical perception\npipeline for visual observations, combined with a hybrid control system for\nsafe execution.

Existing datasets for visual entailment are small and\nsparse compared to datasets for textual entailment. Manually creating datasets\nis labor-intensive. We base our synthetic dataset on the SNLI dataset for\ntextual entailment. We take the premise text from SNLI as input prompts in a\ngenerative image model, Stable Diffusion, creating an image to replace each\ntextual premise. We evaluate our dataset both intrinsically and extrinsically.\nFor extrinsic evaluation, we evaluate the validity of the generated images by\nusing them as training data for a visual entailment classifier based on CLIP\nfeature vectors. We find that synthetic training data only leads to a slight\ndrop in quality on SNLI-VE, with an F-score 0.686 compared to 0.703 when\ntrained on real data. We also compare the quality of our generated training\ndata to original training data on another dataset: SICK-VTE. Again, there is\nonly a slight drop in F-score: from 0.400 to 0.384. These results indicate that\nin settings with data sparsity, synthetic data can be a promising solution for\ntraining visual entailment models."}

However, many real-world systems, such as social or\nbiological networks, exhibit complex interactions that are more naturally\nrepresented by higher-order topological domains. The emerging field of\nGeometric and Topological Deep Learning addresses this challenge by introducing\nmethods that utilize and benefit from higher-order structures. Central to TDL\nis the concept of lifting, which transforms data representations from basic\ngraph forms to more expressive topologies before the application of GNN models\nfor learning. In this work, we propose a structural lifting strategy using\nForman-Ricci curvature, which defines an edge-based network characteristic\nbased on Riemannian geometry. Curvature reveals local and global properties of\na graph, such as a network's backbones, i.e. coarse, structure-preserving graph\ngeometries that form connections between major communities - most suitably\nrepresented as hyperedges to model information flows between clusters across\nlarge distances in the network. To this end, our approach provides a remedy to\nthe problem of information distortion in message passing across long distances\nand graph bottlenecks - a phenomenon known in graph learning as over-squashing."}

However, existing methods suffer from\nthree critical limitations: (1) they rely on homogeneous diffusion with static\ndynamics, limiting adaptability to diverse graph structures; (2) their depth is\nconstrained by computational overhead and diminishing interpretability; and (3)\ntheoretical understanding of their convergence behavior remains limited. To\naddress these challenges, we propose GODNF, a Generalized Opinion Dynamics\nNeural Framework, which unifies multiple opinion dynamics models into a\nprincipled, trainable diffusion mechanism. Our framework captures heterogeneous\ndiffusion patterns and temporal dynamics via node-specific behavior modeling\nand dynamic neighborhood influence, while ensuring efficient and interpretable\nmessage propagation even at deep layers. We provide a rigorous theoretical\nanalysis demonstrating GODNF's ability to model diverse convergence\nconfigurations. Extensive empirical evaluations of node classification and\ninfluence estimation tasks confirm GODNF's superiority over state-of-the-art\nGNNs."}

Existing approaches that\nintegrate SFT and RL often face the risk of disrupting established model\npatterns and inducing overfitting to expert data. To address this, we present a\nnovel investigation into the unified view of SFT and RL through an off-policy\nversus on-policy lens. We propose CHORD, a framework for the Controllable\nHarmonization of On- and Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning via Dynamic\nWeighting, which reframes SFT not as a separate stage but as a dynamically\nweighted auxiliary objective within the on-policy RL process. Based on an\nanalysis of off-policy expert data's influence at both holistic and granular\nlevels, we incorporate a dual-control mechanism in CHORD. Specifically, the\nframework first employs a global coefficient to holistically guide the\ntransition from off-policy imitation to on-policy exploration, and then applies\na token-wise weighting function that enables granular learning from expert\ntokens, which preserves on-policy exploration and mitigates disruption from\noff-policy data. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks,\nproviding empirical evidence that CHORD achieves a stable and efficient\nlearning process. By effectively harmonizing off-policy expert data with\non-policy exploration, CHORD demonstrates significant improvements over\nbaselines.

In this\nwork, we introduce BeyondWeb, a synthetic data generation framework that\nproduces high-quality synthetic data for pretraining.

Gradient-based DFL requires computing\nthe derivative of the solution to the optimization problem with respect to the\npredicted parameters. However, for many optimization problems, such as linear\nprograms (LPs), the gradient of the regret with respect to the predicted\nparameters is zero almost everywhere. Existing gradient-based DFL approaches\nfor LPs try to circumvent this issue in one of two ways: (a) smoothing the LP\ninto a differentiable optimization problem by adding a quadratic regularizer\nand then minimizing the regret directly or (b) minimizing surrogate losses that\nhave informative (sub)gradients. In this paper, we show that the former\napproach still results in zero gradients, because even after smoothing the\nregret remains constant across large regions of the parameter space. To address\nthis, we propose minimizing surrogate losses -- even when a differentiable\noptimization layer is used and regret can be minimized directly. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that minimizing surrogate losses allows differentiable\noptimization layers to achieve regret comparable to or better than\nsurrogate-loss based DFL methods. Further, we demonstrate that this also holds\nfor DYS-Net, a recently proposed differentiable optimization technique for LPs,\nthat computes approximate solutions and gradients through operations that can\nbe performed using feedforward neural network layers.

When adopting a transformer-based detection model to\nperform IOD, catastrophic knowledge forgetting may inevitably occur, meaning\nthe detection performance on previously learned categories may severely\ndegenerate. Previous typical methods mainly rely on knowledge distillation (KD)\nto mitigate the catastrophic knowledge forgetting of transformer-based\ndetection models. Specifically, they utilize Hungarian Matching to build a\ncorrespondence between the queries of the last-phase and current-phase\ndetection models and align the classifier and regressor outputs between matched\nqueries to avoid knowledge forgetting. However, we observe that in IOD task,\nHungarian Matching is not a good choice. With Hungarian Matching, the query of\nthe current-phase model may match different queries of the last-phase model at\ndifferent iterations during KD.

This work investigates a set of key sensors, namely\ninertial measurement units (IMUs), infrared (IR) reflectance, tension, tactile\nsensors, and RGB cameras, integrated into a compliant gripper to classify grasp\nstates. We evaluate the individual contribution of each sensor and compare the\nperformance of two widely used classification models: Random Forest and Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Our results demonstrate that a Random Forest\nclassifier, trained in a controlled lab environment and tested on real cherry\ntomato plants, achieved 100% accuracy in identifying slip, grasp failure, and\nsuccessful picks, marking a substantial improvement over baseline performance.\nFurthermore, we identify a minimal viable sensor combination, namely IMU and\ntension sensors that effectively classifies grasp states.

In contrast, reversing the frame sequence while\npreserving the original PEs causes a substantial drop.

In real-world scenarios, observed\nsatellite images are severely degraded by noise due to measurement equipment\nand environmental conditions. Consequently, some recent studies have focused on\nenhancing the robustness of ST fusion methods against noise. However, existing\nnoise-robust ST fusion approaches often fail to capture fine spatial structure,\nleading to oversmoothing and artifacts. To address this issue, TSSTF introduces\ntwo key mechanisms: Temporally-Guided Total Variation (TGTV) and\nTemporally-Guided Edge Constraint (TGEC). TGTV is a novel regularization\nfunction that promotes spatial piecewise smoothness while preserving structural\ndetails, guided by a reference high spatial resolution image acquired on a\nnearby date. TGEC enforces consistency in edge locations between two temporally\nadjacent images, while allowing for spectral variations. We formulate the ST\nfusion task as a constrained optimization problem incorporating TGTV and TGEC,\nand develop an efficient algorithm based on a preconditioned primal-dual\nsplitting method. Experimental results demonstrate that TSSTF performs\ncomparably to state-of-the-art methods under noise-free conditions and\noutperforms them under noisy conditions. Additionally, we provide a\ncomprehensive set of recommended parameter values that consistently yield high\nperformance across diverse target regions and noise conditions, aiming to\nenhance reproducibility and practical utility."}

In this work, we revisit\nthe adversarial robustness of SNNs through the lens of temporal ensembling,\ntreating the network as a collection of evolving sub-networks across discrete\ntimesteps. This formulation uncovers two critical but underexplored\nchallenges-the fragility of individual temporal sub-networks and the tendency\nfor adversarial vulnerabilities to transfer across time. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose Robust Temporal self-Ensemble (RTE), a training\nframework that improves the robustness of each sub-network while reducing the\ntemporal transferability of adversarial perturbations. RTE integrates both\nobjectives into a unified loss and employs a stochastic sampling strategy for\nefficient optimization. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks\ndemonstrate that RTE consistently outperforms existing training methods in\nrobust-accuracy trade-off. Additional analyses reveal that RTE reshapes the\ninternal robustness landscape of SNNs, leading to more resilient and temporally\ndiversified decision boundaries. Our study highlights the importance of\ntemporal structure in adversarial learning and offers a principled foundation\nfor building robust spiking models."}

For instance, if we intend to put\nsomething into a drawer but notice it is closed, we open it first. However,\nmany autonomous robots lack this adaptive awareness. They often follow\npre-planned actions that may overlook subtle yet critical changes in the scene,\nwhich can result in actions being executed under outdated assumptions and\neventual failure. While replanning is critical for robust autonomy, most\nexisting methods respond only after failures occur, when recovery may be\ninefficient or infeasible. While proactive replanning holds promise for\npreventing failures in advance, current solutions often rely on manually\ndesigned rules and extensive supervision. In this work, we present a proactive\nreplanning framework that detects and corrects failures at subtask boundaries\nby comparing scene graphs constructed from current RGB-D observations against\nreference graphs extracted from successful demonstrations. When the current\nscene fails to align with reference trajectories, a lightweight reasoning\nmodule is activated to diagnose the mismatch and adjust the plan. Experiments\nin the AI2-THOR simulator demonstrate that our approach detects semantic and\nspatial mismatches before execution failures occur, significantly improving\ntask success and robustness."}

We propose a new method to generate extractive explanations for\npredictions made by neural networks, that is based on masking parts of the\ninput which the model does not consider to be indicative of the respective\nclass. The masking is done using gradient-based optimization combined with a\nnew regularization scheme that enforces sufficiency, comprehensiveness and\ncompactness of the generated explanation, three properties that are known to be\ndesirable from the related field of rationale extraction in natural language\nprocessing. In this way, we bridge the gap between model interpretability and\nrationale extraction, thereby proving that the latter of which can be performed\nwithout training a specialized model, only on the basis of a trained\nclassifier. We further apply the same method to image inputs and obtain high\nquality explanations for image classifications, which indicates that the\nconditions proposed for rationale extraction in natural language processing are\nmore broadly applicable to different input types."}

Existing methods\nencode map and agent positions and decode future trajectories in Cartesian\ncoordinates. However, modeling the relationships between the ego vehicle and\nsurrounding traffic elements in Cartesian space can be suboptimal, as it does\nnot naturally capture the varying influence of different elements based on\ntheir relative distances and directions. To address this limitation, we adopt\nthe Polar coordinate system, where positions are represented by radius and\nangle. This representation provides a more intuitive and effective way to model\nspatial changes and relative relationships, especially in terms of distance and\ndirectional influence. Based on this insight, we propose Polaris, a novel\nmethod that operates entirely in Polar coordinates, distinguishing itself from\nconventional Cartesian-based approaches.
