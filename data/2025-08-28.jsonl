To narrow this research gap, this paper proposes\na novel model for the drug release from BNC. Specifically, the drug delivery\nsystem considered in this paper consists of a BNC fleece coated with a polymer.\nThe polymer coating is used as an additional diffusion barrier, enabling the\ncontrolled release of an active pharmaceutical ingredient. The proposed\nphysics-based model reflects the geometry of the BNC and incorporates the\nimpact of the polymer coating on the drug release.

In this paper, we introduce an alternative\ntheory that does not rely on Bragg reflection. Using the Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation for Bloch waves, we consider the crystal lattice as a discrete set of\nobservation points. This discreteness introduces a sampling-like constraint\nanalogous to the Nyquist frequency in signal processing. We show that when the\nelectron wavenumber changes under a periodic potential while the lattice\nspacing remains fixed, a band gap naturally emerges as a sampling effect. By\nconstructing an energy diagram that incorporates this effect, we reveal that\nthe band gap originates from both the wavenumber change and the role of the\nlattice as discrete samplers, leading the energy curve to exhibit translational\nand mirror symmetries with respect to the Nyquist wavenumber.

A common strategy in high-density flash storage is to\nprogram selected blocks in a low-density mode (SLC), sacrificing some capacity\nto achieve higher I/O performance. This hybrid storage architecture has been\nwidely adopted in consumer-grade storage systems. However, existing hybrid\nstorage schemes typically focus on write performance and rely solely on data\ntemperature for migration decisions. This often results in excessive mode\nswitching, causing substantial capacity overhead.\n  In this paper, we present RARO (Reliability-Aware Read performance\nOptimization), a hybrid flash management scheme designed to improve read\nperformance with minimal capacity cost. The key insight behind RARO is that\nmuch of the read slowdown in QLC flash is caused by read retries. RARO triggers\ndata migration only when hot data resides in QLC blocks experiencing a high\nnumber of read retries, significantly reducing unnecessary conversions and\ncapacity loss. Moreover, RARO supports fine-grained multi-mode conversions\n(SLC-TLC-QLC) to further minimize capacity overhead.

The Tlalpan Interpretation (QTI) proposes that the\nwavefunction collapse is not a primitive, axiomatic rule but an emergent\nphenomenon, a spontaneous breaking of time symmetry triggered by amplification\nand record creation. The novelty of QTI lies in its embedding of collapse\nwithin the conceptual language of critical phenomena in statistical physics.\nThe theory introduces measurable parameters (the amplification fraction, the\nrecord asymmetry, and the retrocausal coherence time) that serve as order\nparameters describing the quantum-classical transition. Collapse is thus\ncharacterized not as a mysterious fiat but as a phase transition, with\nthresholds and scaling laws analogous to magnetization in ferromagnets. This\nperspective allows the interpretation to retain microscopic time symmetry and\nspatial locality, while attributing quantum correlations and Bell-type\nviolations to retrocausal boundary constraints rather than instantaneous action\nat a distance. Collapse corresponds to the granularization of trajectories: the\nconversion of smooth, time-symmetric quantum evolution into discrete,\nirreversible records. Most importantly, QTI is testable. It predicts: (1) sharp\nthreshold-like disappearance of interference when amplification exceeds a\ncritical value, (2) anomalously fast decay of reversibility in chaotic optical\ncavities compared with regular ones, and (3) qualitatively new interference\nfringes in a time-symmetric generalization of Moshinsky's diffraction in time.\nIf confirmed, these predictions would place collapse squarely in the realm of\nthermodynamic processes, removing the last \"mystical\" postulate from quantum\ntheory."}

Further, we reveal that\nquantized models \"know\" the truth internally yet still produce false outputs\nwhen guided by \"deceptive\" prompts via layer-wise probing and PCA\nvisualizations. Our findings provide insights into future designs of\nquantization-aware alignment and truthfulness interventions."}

This heterogeneity introduces challenges, as these accelerators and\nDMA-capable devices act as independent bus masters, directly accessing memory.\nConsequently, ensuring both security and timing predictability in such\nenvironments becomes critical. To address these concerns, the Input-Output\nMemory Management Unit (IOMMU) plays a key role in mediating and regulating\nmemory access, preventing unauthorized transactions while enforcing isolation\nand access control policies. While prior work has explored IOMMU-related\nside-channel vulnerabilities from a security standpoint, its role in\nperformance interference remains largely unexplored. Moreover, many of the same\narchitectural properties that enable side-channel leakage, such as shared TLBs,\ncaching effects, and translation overheads, can also introduce timing\nunpredictability. In this work, we analyze the contention effects within IOMMU\nstructures using the Xilinx UltraScale+ ZCU104 platform, demonstrating how\ntheir shared nature introduce unpredictable delays. Our findings reveal that\nIOMMU-induced interference primarily affects small memory transactions, where\ntranslation overheads significantly impact execution time.

Although both approaches provide\nsteady-state reactive power-voltage droop characteristics, their impacts on\nhigh-frequency (HF) stability differ significantly. Firstly, on open-loop (OL)\ncomparison reveals that droop-I control alters HF pole locations. The\napplication of Routh's Stability Criterion further analytically demonstrates\nthat such pole shifts inevitably lead to OL instability. This HF OL instability\nis identified as a structural phenomenon in purely inductive grids and cannot\nbe mitigated through control parameter tuning. As a result, droop-I control\nsignificantly degrades HF stability, making conventional gain and phase margins\ninsufficient for evaluating robustness against parameter variations.

Second, we introduce MIMDRAM, a new\nhardware/software co-designed substrate that addresses the major current\nprogrammability and flexibility limitations of the bulk bitwise execution model\nof processing-using-DRAM (PUD) architectures. MIMDRAM enables the allocation\nand control of only the needed computing resources inside DRAM for PUD\ncomputing. Third, we introduce Proteus, the first hardware framework that\naddresses the high execution latency of bulk bitwise PUD operations in\nstate-of-the-art PUD architectures by implementing a data-aware runtime engine\nfor PUD. Proteus reduces the latency of PUD operations in three different ways:\n(i) Proteus concurrently executes independent in-DRAM primitives belong to a\nsingle PUD operation across DRAM arrays. (ii) Proteus dynamically reduces the\nbit-precision (and consequentially the latency and energy consumption) of PUD\noperations by exploiting narrow values (i.e., values with many leading zeros or\nones). (iii) Proteus chooses and uses the most appropriate data representation\nand arithmetic algorithm implementation for a given PUD instruction\ntransparently to the programmer. Fourth, we introduce DaPPA (data-parallel\nprocessing-in-memory architecture), a new programming framework that eases\nprogrammability for general-purpose PNM architectures by allowing the\nprogrammer to write efficient PIM-friendly code without the need to manage\nhardware resources explicitly."}

To address this challenge, we propose Greedy GuILD\nGrafting Trees (G3T*), a novel path planner that grafts invalid edge\nconnections at both ends to re-establish tree-based connectivity, enabling\nrapid path convergence. G3T* employs a greedy approach using the minimum\nLebesgue measure of guided incremental local densification (GuILD) subsets to\noptimize paths efficiently. Furthermore, G3T* dynamically adjusts the sampling\ndistribution between the informed set and GuILD subsets based on historical and\ncurrent cost improvements, ensuring asymptotic optimality.

Furthermore, we observe that the defect-suppression capability of IELs\ncan also benefit the segmentation network by suppressing artifact propagation.\nBased on this insight, we embed IELs into the decoder of the DGSS model and\npropose IELFormer to strengthen generalization capability in cross-domain\nscenarios. To further strengthen the model's semantic consistency across\nscales, IELFormer incorporates a multi-scale frequency fusion (MFF) module,\nwhich performs frequency-domain analysis to achieve structured integration of\nmulti-resolution features, thereby improving cross-scale coherence.

However, most DNN-based methods suffer from catastrophic\nforgetting and fail to maintain their performance in previously learned\nscenarios after adapting to new data. Recent continual learning (CL) studies\naim to mitigate this phenomenon by enhancing memory stability of DNN, i.e., the\nability to retain learned knowledge. Yet, excessive emphasis on the memory\nstability often impairs learning plasticity, i.e., the capacity of DNN to\nacquire new information effectively. To address such stability-plasticity\ndilemma, this study proposes a novel CL method, synergetic memory rehearsal\n(SyReM), for DNN-based motion forecasting. SyReM maintains a compact memory\nbuffer to represent learned knowledge. To ensure memory stability, it employs\nan inequality constraint that limits increments in the average loss over the\nmemory buffer. Synergistically, a selective memory rehearsal mechanism is\ndesigned to enhance learning plasticity by selecting samples from the memory\nbuffer that are most similar to recently observed data. This selection is based\non an online-measured cosine similarity of loss gradients, ensuring targeted\nmemory rehearsal. Since replayed samples originate from learned scenarios, this\nmemory rehearsal mechanism avoids compromising memory stability. We validate\nSyReM under an online CL paradigm where training samples from diverse scenarios\narrive as a one-pass stream. Experiments on 11 naturalistic driving datasets\nfrom INTERACTION demonstrate that, compared to non-CL and CL baselines, SyReM\nsignificantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting in past scenarios while\nimproving forecasting accuracy in new ones.

The\nformer, action planning, is the core capability that dictates an agent's\nperformance.

This\nparadigm faces two critical challenges: imbalanced optimization objective\nallocation and scarcity of verifiable data, making it difficult to enhance the\nagent's planning capability. To address these challenges, we propose\nReinforcement Learning with Tool-use Rewards (RLTR), a novel framework that\ndecouples the training process to enable a focused, single-objective\noptimization of the planning module. Crucially, RLTR introduces a reward signal\nbased on tool-use completeness to directly evaluate the quality of tool\ninvocation sequences. This method offers a more direct and reliable training\nsignal than assessing the final response content, thereby obviating the need\nfor verifiable data.

This\nwork investigates SNNs for multi-output regression, specifically 3-D satellite\nposition estimation from monocular images, and compares hardware-aware and\nhardware-agnostic energy estimation methods. The proposed SNN, trained using\nthe membrane potential of the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron in the\nfinal layer, achieves comparable Mean Squared Error (MSE) to a reference\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) on a photorealistic satellite dataset.\nEnergy analysis shows that while hardware-agnostic methods predict a consistent\n50-60% energy advantage for SNNs over CNNs, hardware-aware analysis reveals\nthat significant energy savings are realized only on neuromorphic hardware and\nwith high input sparsity. The influence of dark pixel ratio on energy\nconsumption is quantified, emphasizing the impact of data characteristics and\nhardware assumptions.

The approach frames the problem as a 3D generative modeling\ntask, consisting of a two-stage pipeline. First a diffusion model is trained to\ngenerate independent 3D voxel grids representing granular media. Second, a 3D\ninpainting model, adapted from 2D inpainting techniques using masked inputs,\nstitches these grids together seamlessly, enabling synthesis of large samples\nwith physically realistic structure. The inpainting model explores several\nmasking strategies for the inputs to the underlying UNets by training the\nnetwork to infer missing portions of voxel grids from a concatenation of noised\ntensors, masks, and masked tensors as input channels. The model also adapts a\n2D repainting technique of re-injecting noise scheduler output with ground\ntruth to provide a strong guidance to the 3D model.

The\nmajority of existing solutions towards link sign prediction mainly focus on\nunipartite signed graphs, which are sub-optimal due to the neglect of node\nheterogeneity and unique bipartite characteristics of SBGs. To this end, recent\nstudies adapt graph neural networks to SBGs by introducing message-passing\nschemes for both inter-partition (UxV) and intra-partition (UxU or VxV) node\npairs. However, the fundamental spectral convolutional operators were\noriginally designed for positive links in unsigned graphs, and thus, are not\noptimal for inferring missing positive or negative links from known ones in\nSBGs.\n  Motivated by this, this paper proposes GegenNet, a novel and effective\nspectral convolutional neural network model for link sign prediction in SBGs.\nIn particular, GegenNet achieves enhanced model capacity and high predictive\naccuracy through three main technical contributions: (i) fast and theoretically\ngrounded spectral decomposition techniques for node feature initialization;\n(ii) a new spectral graph filter based on the Gegenbauer polynomial basis; and\n(iii) multi-layer sign-aware spectral convolutional networks alternating\nGegenbauer polynomial filters with positive and negative edges. Our extensive\nempirical studies reveal that GegenNet can achieve significantly superior\nperformance (up to a gain of 4.28% in AUC and 11.69% in F1) in link sign\nprediction compared to 11 strong competitors over 6 benchmark SBG datasets."}

However, we identify a\ncritical vulnerability of using LLMs for data fitting -- making changes to data\nrepresentation that are completely irrelevant to the underlying learning task\ncan drastically alter LLMs' predictions on the same data. For example, simply\nchanging variable names can sway the size of prediction error by as much as 82%\nin certain settings. Such prediction sensitivity with respect to\ntask-irrelevant variations manifests under both in-context learning and\nsupervised fine-tuning, for both close-weight and open-weight general-purpose\nLLMs. Moreover, by examining the attention scores of an open-weight LLM, we\ndiscover a non-uniform attention pattern: training examples and variable\nnames/values which happen to occupy certain positions in the prompt receive\nmore attention when output tokens are generated, even though different\npositions are expected to receive roughly the same attention.

Such emails contain personalized recommendations\ntailored to each user's interests, enticing users to buy relevant items. A\ncommon limitation of these emails is that the primary entry point, the title of\nthe email, tends to follow fixed templates, failing to inspire enough interest\nin the contents. In this work, we explore the potential of large language\nmodels (LLMs) for generating thematic titles that reflect the personalized\ncontent of the emails. We perform offline simulations and conduct online\nexperiments on the order of millions of users, finding our techniques useful in\nimproving the engagement between customers and our emails.

However,\nseveral limitations remain: (1) Existing pose-guided character motion transfer\nmethods merely replicate motion without learning its style characteristics,\nresulting in inexpressive characters. (2) Motion style transfer methods rely\nheavily on motion capture data, which is difficult to obtain. (3) Generated\nmotions sometimes violate physical laws. To address these challenges, this\npaper pioneers a new task: Video-to-Video Motion Personalization. We propose a\nnovel framework, PersonaAnimator, which learns personalized motion patterns\ndirectly from unconstrained videos. This enables personalized motion transfer.\nTo support this task, we introduce PersonaVid, the first video-based\npersonalized motion dataset. It contains 20 motion content categories and 120\nmotion style categories. We further propose a Physics-aware Motion Style\nRegularization mechanism to enforce physical plausibility in the generated\nmotions. Extensive experiments show that PersonaAnimator outperforms\nstate-of-the-art motion transfer methods and sets a new benchmark for the\nVideo-to-Video Motion Personalization task."}

To address these limitations, we propose MPAMatch - a novel\nsegmentation framework that performs pixel-level contrastive learning under a\nmultimodal prototype-guided supervision paradigm. The core innovation of\nMPAMatch lies in the dual contrastive learning scheme between image prototypes\nand pixel labels, and between text prototypes and pixel labels, providing\nsupervision at both structural and semantic levels. This coarse-to-fine\nsupervisory strategy not only enhances the discriminative capability on\nunlabeled samples but also introduces the text prototype supervision into\nsegmentation for the first time, significantly improving semantic boundary\nmodeling. In addition, we reconstruct the classic segmentation architecture\n(TransUNet) by replacing its ViT backbone with a pathology-pretrained\nfoundation model (Uni), enabling more effective extraction of\npathology-relevant features. Extensive experiments on GLAS, EBHI-SEG-GLAND,\nEBHI-SEG-CANCER, and KPI show MPAMatch's superiority over state-of-the-art\nmethods, validating its dual advantages in structural and semantic modeling."}

Although such models are routinely fine-tuned for\ndownstream NLP tasks, recent work shows they remain vulnerable to backdoor\nattacks that survive vanilla fine-tuning. These attacks are difficult to defend\nbecause end users typically lack knowledge of the attack triggers. Such attacks\nconsist of stealthy malicious triggers introduced through subtle syntactic or\nstylistic manipulations, which can bypass traditional detection and remain in\nthe model, making post-hoc purification essential. In this study, we explore\nwhether attention-head pruning can mitigate these threats without any knowledge\nof the trigger or access to a clean reference model. To this end, we design and\nimplement six pruning-based strategies: (i) gradient-based pruning, (ii)\nlayer-wise variance pruning, (iii) gradient-based pruning with structured L1/L2\nsparsification, (iv) randomized ensemble pruning, (v)\nreinforcement-learning-guided pruning, and (vi) Bayesian uncertainty pruning.\nEach method iteratively removes the least informative heads while monitoring\nvalidation accuracy to avoid over-pruning.

We\nintroduce object-based set similarity ($\\mathrm{OSS}$), a metric that addresses\nthese challenges. $\\mathrm{OSS}$ (1) quantifies AL method effectiveness without\nrequiring detector training by measuring similarity between training sets and\ntarget domains using object-level features.

As with any critical\nsafety equipment, a failure will halt operations leading to service\ndisruptions; therefore, pre-emptive maintenance may avoid unnecessary\ninterruptions by detecting anomalies before they become failures. Previous work\nrelies on several inputs and crafting custom features by segmenting the signal.\nThis not only adds additional requirements for data collection and processing,\nbut it is also specific to the PM technology, the installed locations and\noperational conditions limiting scalability. Based on the available maintenance\nrecords, the main failure causes for PM are obstacles, friction, power source\nissues and misalignment. Those failures affect the energy consumption pattern\nof PMs, altering the usual (or healthy) shape of the power signal during the PM\nmovement. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art, our method requires only\none input. We apply a deep learning model to the power signal pattern to\nclassify if the PM is nominal or associated with any failure type, achieving\n>99.99\\% precision, <0.01\\% false positives and negligible false negatives.

They usually focus on the 3D domain only,\nwithout leveraging the complementary nature of 2D and 3D data. Besides, some\nmethods extend original labels or generate pseudo labels to guide the training,\nbut they often fail to fully use these labels or address the noise within them.\nMeanwhile, the emergence of comprehensive and adaptable foundation models has\noffered effective solutions for segmenting 2D data. Leveraging this\nadvancement, we present a novel approach that maximizes the utility of sparsely\navailable 3D annotations by incorporating segmentation masks generated by 2D\nfoundation models. We further propagate the 2D segmentation masks into the 3D\nspace by establishing geometric correspondences between 3D scenes and 2D views.\nWe extend the highly sparse annotations to encompass the areas delineated by 3D\nmasks, thereby substantially augmenting the pool of available labels.\nFurthermore, we apply confidence- and uncertainty-based consistency\nregularization on augmentations of the 3D point cloud and select the reliable\npseudo labels, which are further spread on the 3D masks to generate more\nlabels. This innovative strategy bridges the gap between limited 3D annotations\nand the powerful capabilities of 2D foundation models, ultimately improving the\nperformance of 3D weakly supervised segmentation."}

A common approach to\nimprove generalization is to augment the source domain with synthetic data\ngenerated by diffusion models (DMs). However, the generated images often\ncontain structural or semantic defects due to training imperfections. Training\nsegmentation models with such flawed data can lead to performance degradation\nand error accumulation. To address this issue, we propose to integrate inverse\nevolution layers (IELs) into the generative process. IELs are designed to\nhighlight spatial discontinuities and semantic inconsistencies using\nLaplacian-based priors, enabling more effective filtering of undesirable\ngenerative patterns. Based on this mechanism, we introduce IELDM, an enhanced\ndiffusion-based data augmentation framework that can produce higher-quality\nimages. Furthermore, we observe that the defect-suppression capability of IELs\ncan also benefit the segmentation network by suppressing artifact propagation.\nBased on this insight, we embed IELs into the decoder of the DGSS model and\npropose IELFormer to strengthen generalization capability in cross-domain\nscenarios. To further strengthen the model's semantic consistency across\nscales, IELFormer incorporates a multi-scale frequency fusion (MFF) module,\nwhich performs frequency-domain analysis to achieve structured integration of\nmulti-resolution features, thereby improving cross-scale coherence. Extensive\nexperiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves\nsuperior generalization performance compared to existing methods."}

We provide a method for generating\nsemi-artificial fully classical datasets, on which we show one of the first\nevidence of the existence of classical datasets where QKMs require less data\nduring training. Additionally, our study introduces a new analytical tool to\nthe QML domain, derived for classical kernel methods, which can be aimed at\ninvestigating the classical-quantum gap. Our empirical results reveal that QKMs\ncan achieve low error rates with less training data compared to classical\ncounterparts. Furthermore, our method allows for the generation of datasets\nwith varying properties, facilitating further investigation into the\ncharacteristics of real-world datasets that may be particularly advantageous\nfor QKMs. We also show that the predicted performance from the analytical tool\nwe propose - a generalization metric from classical domain - show great\nalignment empirical evidence, which fills the gap previously existing in the\nfield.

From a frequency-domain perspective, we identify that\ndistribution shifts often distort high-frequency visual cues exploited by deep\nmodels, and introduce a low-frequency filtering strategy to encourage reliance\non domain-invariant features. However, such information loss may degrade\nIn-Distribution (ID) calibration performance. Therefore, we further propose a\ngradient-based rectification mechanism that enforces ID calibration as a hard\nconstraint during optimization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world shifted\ndatasets, including CIFAR-10/100-C and WILDS, demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly improves calibration under distribution shift while maintaining\nstrong in-distribution performance."}

However, their inference remains slower than that of\nautoregressive models, primarily due to the cost of bidirectional attention and\nthe large number of refinement steps required for high quality outputs. In this\nwork, we highlight and leverage an overlooked property of DLMs early answer\nconvergence: in many cases, the correct answer can be internally identified by\nhalf steps before the final decoding step, both under semi-autoregressive and\nrandom remasking schedules. For example, on GSM8K and MMLU, up to 97% and 99%\nof instances, respectively, can be decoded correctly using only half of the\nrefinement steps. Building on this observation, we introduce Prophet, a\ntraining-free fast decoding paradigm that enables early commit decoding.\nSpecifically, Prophet dynamically decides whether to continue refinement or to\ngo \"all-in\" (i.e., decode all remaining tokens in one step), using the\nconfidence gap between the top-2 prediction candidates as the criterion. It\nintegrates seamlessly into existing DLM implementations, incurs negligible\noverhead, and requires no additional training. Empirical evaluations of\nLLaDA-8B and Dream-7B across multiple tasks show that Prophet reduces the\nnumber of decoding steps by up to 3.4x while preserving high generation\nquality. These results recast DLM decoding as a problem of when to stop\nsampling, and demonstrate that early decode convergence provides a simple yet\npowerful mechanism for accelerating DLM inference, complementary to existing\nspeedup techniques.

An emerging class of systems promises these exciting\ncapabilities through generative research synthesis, performing retrieval over\nthe live web and synthesizing discovered sources into long-form, cited\nsummaries. However, evaluating such systems remains an open challenge: existing\nquestion-answering benchmarks focus on short-form factual responses, while\nexpert-curated datasets risk staleness and data contamination. Both fail to\ncapture the complexity and evolving nature of real research synthesis tasks. In\nthis work, we introduce DeepScholar-bench, a live benchmark and holistic,\nautomated evaluation framework designed to evaluate generative research\nsynthesis. DeepScholar-bench draws queries from recent, high-quality ArXiv\npapers and focuses on a real research synthesis task: generating the related\nwork sections of a paper by retrieving, synthesizing, and citing prior\nresearch. Our evaluation framework holistically assesses performance across\nthree key dimensions, knowledge synthesis, retrieval quality, and\nverifiability. We also develop DeepScholar-base, a reference pipeline\nimplemented efficiently using the LOTUS API. Using the DeepScholar-bench\nframework, we perform a systematic evaluation of prior open-source systems,\nsearch AI's, OpenAI's DeepResearch, and DeepScholar-base. We find that\nDeepScholar-base establishes a strong baseline, attaining competitive or higher\nperformance than each other method. We also find that DeepScholar-bench remains\nfar from saturated, with no system exceeding a score of $19\\%$ across all\nmetrics. These results underscore the difficulty of DeepScholar-bench, as well\nas its importance for progress towards AI systems capable of generative\nresearch synthesis. We make our code available at\nhttps://github.com/guestrin-lab/deepscholar-bench."}

Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatments\nhave been effective in slowing the progression of neovascular AMD, with better\noutcomes achieved through timely diagnosis and consistent monitoring. Tracking\nthe progression of neovascular activity in OCT scans of patients with exudative\nAMD allows for the development of more personalized and effective treatment\nplans. This was the focus of the Monitoring Age-related Macular Degeneration\nProgression in Optical Coherence Tomography (MARIO) challenge, in which we\nparticipated. In Task 1, which involved classifying the evolution between two\npairs of 2D slices from consecutive OCT acquisitions, we employed a fusion CNN\nnetwork with model ensembling to further enhance the model's performance. For\nTask 2, which focused on predicting progression over the next three months\nbased on current exam data, we proposed the Patch Progression Masked\nAutoencoder that generates an OCT for the next exam and then classifies the\nevolution between the current OCT and the one generated using our solution from\nTask 1. The results we achieved allowed us to place in the Top 10 for both\ntasks. Some team members are part of the same organization as the challenge\norganizers; therefore, we are not eligible to compete for the prize."}

In contrast, continuous optimization-based planners offer\nhigher-quality paths but suffer from the curse of dimensionality, resulting in\npoor scalability with respect to the number of robots. This paper tackles the\nlimitations of these two approaches by introducing a novel framework that\nintegrates discrete MAPF solvers with constrained generative diffusion models.\nThe resulting framework, called Discrete-Guided Diffusion (DGD), has three key\ncharacteristics: (1) it decomposes the original nonconvex MRMP problem into\ntractable subproblems with convex configuration spaces, (2) it combines\ndiscrete MAPF solutions with constrained optimization techniques to guide\ndiffusion models capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies among robots, and\n(3) it incorporates a lightweight constraint repair mechanism to ensure\ntrajectory feasibility. The proposed method sets a new state-of-the-art\nperformance in large-scale, complex environments, scaling to 100 robots while\nachieving planning efficiency and high success rates."}

Existing approaches\nsuffer from a trade-off: generalist agents excel at planning but perform poorly\nin execution, while specialized agents demonstrate the opposite weakness.\nRecent compositional frameworks attempt to bridge this gap by combining a\nplanner and an actor, but they are typically static and non-trainable, which\nprevents adaptation from experience. This is a critical limitation given the\nscarcity of high-quality data in scientific domains. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce CODA, a novel and trainable compositional framework\nthat integrates a generalist planner (Cerebrum) with a specialist executor\n(Cerebellum), trained via a dedicated two-stage pipeline. In the first stage,\nSpecialization, we apply a decoupled GRPO approach to train an expert planner\nfor each scientific application individually, bootstrapping from a small set of\ntask trajectories. In the second stage, Generalization, we aggregate all\nsuccessful trajectories from the specialized experts to build a consolidated\ndataset, which is then used for supervised fine-tuning of the final planner.\nThis equips CODA with both robust execution and cross-domain generalization.\nEvaluated on four challenging applications from the ScienceBoard benchmark,\nCODA significantly outperforms baselines and establishes a new state of the art\namong open-source models."}
