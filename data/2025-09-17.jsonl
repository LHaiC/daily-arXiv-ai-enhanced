This allows NTK theory to be extended to nonsmooth\nfunctions, stochastic estimators, and broader families of models. We explore\nboth fixed-kernel and attention-based formulations of this nonlocal operator.\nWe illustrate the new formulation with numerical studies."}

Existing studies typically improve energy and\ntravel efficiency for individual CAVs without considering their impacts on the\nentire mixed-traffic platoon, leading to inefficient traffic flow. While\nReinforcement Learning (RL) has the potential to achieve platoon-level control\nin a mixed-traffic environment, the training of RL is still challenged by (i)\ncar-following safety, i.e., CAVs should not collide with their immediate\npreceding vehicles, and (ii) red-light safety, i.e., CAVs should not run red\nlights. To address these challenges, this paper develops a platoon-centric,\nsafe RL-based GLOSA system that uses a multi-agent controller to optimize CAV\nspeed while achieving a balance between energy consumption and travel\nefficiency. We further incorporate Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) into the\nRL-based policy to provide explicit safety guarantees in terms of car-following\nsafety and red-light safety.

However, challenges have remained in designing accurate thermal\ncharacteristics based on quasi-ballistic phonon transport. The quasi-ballistic\nthermal transport arises from the combination of wave-like and diffusive phonon\nbehaviors unlike pure diffusion. The topological nature has been known to be\ncompatible with both wave and diffusive phenomena. Therefore, topological\nphononic crystals have great potential for the development of controllable and\ndesignable thermal transport based on quasi-ballistic phonons. In this study,\nwe experimentally investigated the thermal behavior at the scale of\nquasi-ballistic phonon transport using a 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model-based\ntopological phononic crystal. Quasi-ballistic phonon transport was observed\nthrough change in thermal conductivity depending on the structural parameters\nof topological systems using micro-thermoreflectance. Furthermore, using\ntopological interface states, the experimentally observed thermal behaviors\nwere found to agree well with the theoretically expected those. Accordingly,\nthe topological nature is an effective approach for thermal management in\nmicro- and nanoscale systems with quasi-ballistic phonon transport. Our results\npave the way for a unified control scheme for wave and diffusion phenomena,\nsuch as quasi-ballistic phonons."}

While traditional clustering and\npruning (down-sampling) approaches can be useful for this, they can often lead\nto information loss or a failure to properly identify distinct regions of the\npotential energy surface due to difficulties associated with the high\ndimensionality of atomic descriptors. In this work, we introduce the\nMulti-kernel Edge Attention-based Graph Autoencoder (MEAGraph) model, an\nunsupervised approach for analyzing atomic datasets. MEAGraph combines multiple\nlinear kernel transformations with attention-based message passing to capture\ngeometric sensitivity and enable effective dataset pruning without relying on\nlabels or extensive training. Demonstrated applications on niobium, tantalum,\nand iron datasets show that MEAGraph efficiently groups similar atomic\nenvironments, allowing for the use of basic pruning techniques for removing\nsampling bias. This approach provides an effective method for representation\nlearning and clustering that can be used for data analysis, outlier detection,\nand dataset optimization."}

A common way of controlling such\nmanipulators relies on adjusting tendon lengths, which is an accessible control\nparameter. This approach works well when the kinematic configuration is\nrepresentative of the real operational conditions. However, when dealing with\nmanipulators of larger size subject to gravity, it becomes necessary to solve a\nstatic force problem, using tendon force as the input and employing a mapping\nfrom the configuration space to retrieve tendon length. Alternatively,\nmeasurements of the manipulator posture can be used to iteratively adjust\ntendon lengths to achieve a desired posture. Hence, either tension measurement\nor state estimation of the manipulator are required, both of which are not\nalways accurately available. Here, we propose a solution by reconciling cables\ntension and length as the input for the solution of the system forward statics.\nWe develop a screw-based formulation for a tendon-driven, multi-segment,\nhyper-redundant manipulator with elastic joints and introduce a forward statics\niterative solution method that equivalently makes use of either tendon length\nor tension as the input.

A key\nbottleneck in traversability estimation lies in efficiently achieving reliable\nand robust predictions while accurately encoding both geometric and semantic\ninformation across diverse environments. We introduce Navigation via Mixture of\nExperts (NAVMOE), a hierarchical and modular approach for traversability\nestimation and local navigation. NAVMOE combines multiple specialized models\nfor specific terrain types, each of which can be either a classical model-based\nor a learning-based approach that predicts traversability for specific terrain\ntypes. NAVMOE dynamically weights the contributions of different models based\non the input environment through a gating network. Overall, our approach offers\nthree advantages: First, NAVMOE enables traversability estimation to adaptively\nleverage specialized approaches for different terrains, which enhances\ngeneralization across diverse and unseen environments. Second, our approach\nsignificantly improves efficiency with negligible cost of solution quality by\nintroducing a training-free lazy gating mechanism, which is designed to\nminimize the number of activated experts during inference. Third, our approach\nuses a two-stage training strategy that enables the training for the gating\nnetworks within the hybrid MoE method that contains nondifferentiable modules.\nExtensive experiments show that NAVMOE delivers a better efficiency and\nperformance balance than any individual expert or full ensemble across\ndifferent domains, improving cross- domain generalization and reducing average\ncomputational cost by 81.2% via lazy gating, with less than a 2% loss in path\nquality."}

These methodologies apply to\nfew-qubit scenarios and naturally scale to larger N-qubit systems. We benchmark\nthem across fundamental quantum tasks: entanglement preservation/generation,\nand directed quantum transport in a disordered quantum walk. All simulations\nare performed in a challenging environment featuring non-Markov colored noise,\nimperfections, and the Markov Lindblad equation. With a complex task-dependent\nperformance hierarchy, our deterministic protocols proved highly effective for\nentanglement generation/preservation, and in specific pulse configurations,\nthey even outperformed the RL-optimization. In contrast, more advanced methods\ndemonstrate a marked specialization. For entanglement preservation, a\nphysics-informed hybrid Quantum Error Correction and Dynamical Decoupling\n(QEC-DD) protocol provides the most stable and effective solution,\noutperforming all other approaches. Conversely, for dynamic tasks requiring the\ndiscovery of non-trivial control sequences, such as DD, Floquet engineering,\nand rapid entanglement generation or coherent transport, the model-free\nReinforcement Learning (RL) agents consistently find superior solutions. We\nfurther demonstrate that the control pulse envelope is a non-trivial factor\nthat actively shapes the control landscape, which determines the difficulty for\nall protocols and highlights the adaptability of the RL agent.

And their black-box nature limits clinical adoption.\nTo address these limitations, we introduce ECG-aBcDe, a novel ECG encoding\nmethod that transforms ECG signals into a universal ECG language readily\ninterpretable by any LLM. By constructing a hybrid dataset of ECG language and\nnatural language, ECG-aBcDe enables direct fine-tuning of pre-trained LLMs\nwithout architectural modifications, achieving \"construct once, use anywhere\"\ncapability. Moreover, the bidirectional convertibility between ECG and ECG\nlanguage of ECG-aBcDe allows for extracting attention heatmaps from ECG\nsignals, significantly enhancing interpretability. Finally, ECG-aBcDe\nexplicitly represents time-scale information, mitigating Transformer\nlimitations. This work presents a new paradigm for integrating ECG analysis\nwith LLMs. Compared with existing methods, our method achieves competitive\nperformance on ROUGE-L and METEOR.

We examine this through the lens of\nmulti-robot patrol, in which teams of patrol robots must persistently minimise\ntime between visits to points of interest, within environments where\ntraversability of routes is highly dynamic. These dynamics must be observed by\npatrol agents and accounted for in a fully decentralised on-line manner. In\nthis work, we present a new method of monitoring and adjusting for environment\ndynamics in a decentralised multi-robot patrol team. We demonstrate that our\nmethod significantly outperforms realistic baselines in highly dynamic\nscenarios, and also investigate dynamic scenarios in which explicitly\naccounting for environment dynamics may be unnecessary or impractical."}

To address these, we design a scalable\nframework that automatically constructs heterogeneous environments that are\nfully simulated, systematically broadening the space of function-calling\nscenarios.

By constraining the generation process at\neach stage, we implement a hierarchical graph beta-diffusion process for\nstructural synthesis, paired with a temporal autoencoder that embeds\ntime-series data into a compact latent space, improving both training stability\nand sample fidelity. Experiments across benchmark settings show that PowerGrow\nnot only outperforms prior diffusion models in fidelity and diversity but also\nachieves a 98.9\\% power flow convergence rate and improved N-1 contingency\nresilience. This demonstrates its ability to generate operationally valid and\nrealistic power grid scenarios."}

To assist in this matter, automated assembly control\nusing computer vision methods has been widely implemented. However, the costs\nassociated with image acquisition, annotation, and training of computer vision\nalgorithms pose challenges for integration, especially for small- and\nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which often lack the resources for extensive\ntraining, data collection, and manual image annotation.

CNNs are a class of\nmachine-learning algorithms specifically designed for processing structured\ngrid data. They have gained popularity in recent years due to their remarkable\nperformance in various computer vision tasks, including image classification,\nobject detection, and image segmentation. In this research, we generated a\nlarge irradiated TRISO layer dataset with more than 2,000 microscopic images of\ncross-sectional TRISO particles and the corresponding annotated images. Based\non these annotated images, we used different CNNs to automatically segment\ndifferent TRISO layers. These CNNs include RU-Net (developed in this study), as\nwell as three existing architectures: U-Net, Residual Network (ResNet), and\nAttention U-Net. The preliminary results show that the model based on RU-Net\nperforms best in terms of Intersection over Union (IoU). Using CNN models, we\ncan expedite the analysis of TRISO particle cross sections, significantly\nreducing the manual labor involved and improving the objectivity of the\nsegmentation results."}

We outline a methodology\ninvolving data collection from Minnesota farms, application of local deep\nlearning algorithms, transfer learning, and a central aggregation server for\nmodel refinement, aiming to achieve improved accuracy in disease detection,\ngood generalization across agricultural scenarios, lower costs in communication\nand training time, and earlier identification and intervention against diseases\nin future implementations. We outline a methodology and anticipated outcomes,\nsetting the stage for empirical validation in subsequent studies. This work\ncomes in a context where more and more demand for data-driven interpretations\nin agriculture has to be weighed with concerns about privacy from farms that\nare hesitant to share their operational data. This will be important to provide\na secure and efficient disease detection method that can finally revolutionize\nsmart farming systems and solve local agricultural problems with data\nconfidentiality. In doing so, this paper bridges the gap between advanced\nmachine learning techniques and the practical, privacy-sensitive needs of\nfarmers in Minnesota and beyond, leveraging the benefits of federated learning."}

Conventional clustering methods,\nincluding recurrent and convolutional models, often struggle to capture both\nlocal and global temporal relationships while preserving spatial context. We\npresent a time-distributed hybrid U-Net autoencoder that integrates a\nBi-directional Temporal Graph Attention Transformer (B-TGAT) to guide efficient\ntemporal clustering of multidimensional spatiotemporal climate datasets. The\nencoder and decoder are equipped with ConvLSTM2D modules that extract joint\nspatial--temporal features by modeling localized dynamics and spatial\ncorrelations over time, and skip connections that preserve multiscale spatial\ndetails during feature compression and reconstruction. At the bottleneck,\nB-TGAT integrates graph-based spatial modeling with attention-driven temporal\nencoding, enabling adaptive weighting of temporal neighbors and capturing both\nshort and long-range dependencies across regions. This architecture produces\ndiscriminative latent embeddings optimized for clustering. Experiments on three\ndistinct spatiotemporal climate datasets demonstrate superior cluster\nseparability, temporal stability, and alignment with known climate transitions\ncompared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the\nslow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient\nmodels are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission\nof redundant or low-value data, e.g. cloud-covered areas. To this end, we\nintroduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL)\nframework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL\nintegrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw\npuzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively\nincreases data complexity during self-supervision. This enables the encoder to\njointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global\nsemantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously\naddresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally\nefficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models\nfor onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public\nbenchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation\ntasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some\nstate-of-the-art models. These results highlight the potential of CMTSSL in\ngeneralizable representation learning with lightweight architectures for\nreal-world HSI applications.

We introduce Single-stream Policy Optimization (SPO), which\neliminates these issues by design. SPO replaces per-group baselines with a\npersistent, KL-adaptive value tracker and normalizes advantages globally across\nthe batch, providing a stable, low-variance learning signal for every sample.\nBeing group-free, SPO enables higher throughput and scales effectively in\nlong-horizon or tool-integrated settings where generation times vary.\nFurthermore, the persistent value tracker naturally enables an adaptive\ncurriculum via prioritized sampling. Experiments using Qwen3-8B show that SPO\nconverges more smoothly and attains higher accuracy than GRPO, while\neliminating computation wasted on degenerate groups.

During the process, they often re-derive the same\nintermediate steps across problems, inflating token usage and latency. This\nsaturation of the context window leaves less capacity for exploration. We study\na simple mechanism that converts recurring reasoning fragments into concise,\nreusable \"behaviors\" (name + instruction) via the model's own metacognitive\nanalysis of prior traces. These behaviors are stored in a \"behavior handbook\"\nwhich supplies them to the model in-context at inference or distills them into\nparameters via supervised fine-tuning. This approach achieves improved\ntest-time reasoning across three different settings - 1) Behavior-conditioned\ninference: Providing the LLM relevant behaviors in-context during reasoning\nreduces number of reasoning tokens by up to 46% while matching or improving\nbaseline accuracy; 2) Behavior-guided self-improvement: Without any parameter\nupdates, the model improves its own future reasoning by leveraging behaviors\nfrom its own past problem solving attempts. This yields up to 10% higher\naccuracy than a naive critique-and-revise baseline; and 3) Behavior-conditioned\nSFT: SFT on behavior-conditioned reasoning traces is more effective at\nconverting non-reasoning models into reasoning models as compared to vanilla\nSFT. Together, these results indicate that turning slow derivations into fast\nprocedural hints enables LLMs to remember how to reason, not just what to\nconclude."}

In this\npaper, we make three contributions to reduce the cost of computing features for\ntemporally dense tasks. First, we introduce a vision transformer (ViT)\narchitecture, dubbed ResidualViT, that leverages the large temporal redundancy\nin videos to efficiently compute temporally dense frame-level features. Our\narchitecture incorporates (i) learnable residual connections that ensure\ntemporal consistency across consecutive frames and (ii) a token reduction\nmodule that enhances processing speed by selectively discarding temporally\nredundant information while reusing weights of a pretrained foundation model.\nSecond, we propose a lightweight distillation strategy to approximate the\nframe-level features of the original foundation model. Finally, we evaluate our\napproach across four tasks and five datasets, in both zero-shot and fully\nsupervised settings, demonstrating significant reductions in computational cost\n(up to 60%) and improvements in inference speed (up to 2.5x faster), all while\nclosely approximating the accuracy of the original foundation model."}

The success of such attacks\nheavily relies on their stealthiness, the ability to blend in with the original\ngraph and evade detection. However, existing methods often achieve stealthiness\nby relying on indirect proxy metrics, lacking consideration for the fundamental\ncharacteristics of the injected content, or focusing only on imitating local\nstructures, which leads to the problem of local myopia. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a dual-constraint stealthy node injection framework,\ncalled Joint Alignment of Nodal and Universal Structures (JANUS). At the local\nlevel, we introduce a local feature manifold alignment strategy to achieve\ngeometric consistency in the feature space. At the global level, we incorporate\nstructured latent variables and maximize the mutual information with the\ngenerated structures, ensuring the injected structures are consistent with the\nsemantic patterns of the original graph.
