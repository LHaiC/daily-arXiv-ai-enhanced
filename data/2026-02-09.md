Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Creating high-fidelity, animatable 3D talking heads is crucial for immersive applications, yet often hindered by the prevalence of low-quality image or video sources, which yield poor 3D reconstructions. In this paper, we introduce SuperHead, a novel framework for enhancing low-resolution, animatable 3D head avatars. The core challenge lies in synthesizing high-quality geometry and textures, while ensuring both 3D and temporal consistency during animation and preserving subject identity. Despite recent progress in image, video and 3D-based super-resolution (SR), existing SR techniques are ill-equipped to handle dynamic 3D inputs. To address this, SuperHead leverages the rich priors from pre-trained 3D generative models via a novel dynamics-aware 3D inversion scheme. This process optimizes the latent representation of the generative model to produce a super-resolved 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) head model, which is subsequently rigged to an underlying parametric head model (e.g., FLAME) for animation. The inversion is jointly supervised using a sparse collection of upscaled 2D face renderings and corresponding depth maps, captured from diverse facial expressions and camera viewpoints, to ensure realism under dynamic facial motions. Experiments demonstrate that SuperHead generates avatars with fine-grained facial details under dynamic motions, significantly outperforming baseline methods in visual quality.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Understanding egocentric videos plays a vital role for embodied intelligence. Recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) can accept both visual and audio inputs. However, due to the challenge of obtaining text labels with coherent joint-modality information, whether MLLMs can jointly understand both modalities in egocentric videos remains under-explored. To address this problem, we introduce EgoAVU, a scalable data engine to automatically generate egocentric audio-visual narrations, questions, and answers. EgoAVU enriches human narrations with multimodal context and generates audio-visual narrations through cross-modal correlation modeling. Token-based video filtering and modular, graph-based curation ensure both data diversity and quality. Leveraging EgoAVU, we construct EgoAVU-Instruct, a large-scale training dataset of 3M samples, and EgoAVU-Bench, a manually verified evaluation split covering diverse tasks. EgoAVU-Bench clearly reveals the limitations of existing MLLMs: they bias heavily toward visual signals, often neglecting audio cues or failing to correspond audio with the visual source. Finetuning MLLMs on EgoAVU-Instruct effectively addresses this issue, enabling up to 113% performance improvement on EgoAVU-Bench. Such benefits also transfer to other benchmarks such as EgoTempo and EgoIllusion, achieving up to 28% relative performance gain. Code will be released to the community.

Abstract: Single-view 3D reconstruction in complex real-world scenes is challenging due to noise, object diversity, and limited dataset availability. To address these challenges, we propose MGP-KAD, a novel multimodal feature fusion framework that integrates RGB and geometric prior to enhance reconstruction accuracy. The geometric prior is generated by sampling and clustering ground-truth object data, producing class-level features that dynamically adjust during training to improve geometric understanding. Additionally, we introduce a hybrid decoder based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to overcome the limitations of traditional linear decoders in processing complex multimodal inputs. Extensive experiments on the Pix3D dataset demonstrate that MGP-KAD achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, significantly improving geometric integrity, smoothness, and detail preservation. Our work provides a robust and effective solution for advancing single-view 3D reconstruction in complex scenes.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Driven by the emergence of Controllable Video Diffusion, existing Sim2Real methods for autonomous driving video generation typically rely on explicit intermediate representations to bridge the domain gap. However, these modalities face a fundamental Consistency-Realism Dilemma. Low-level signals (e.g., edges, blurred images) ensure precise control but compromise realism by "baking in" synthetic artifacts, whereas high-level priors (e.g., depth, semantics, HDMaps) facilitate photorealism but lack the structural detail required for consistent guidance. In this work, we present Driving with DINO (DwD), a novel framework that leverages Vision Foundation Module (VFM) features as a unified bridge between the simulation and real-world domains. We first identify that these features encode a spectrum of information, from high-level semantics to fine-grained structure. To effectively utilize this, we employ Principal Subspace Projection to discard the high-frequency elements responsible for "texture baking," while concurrently introducing Random Channel Tail Drop to mitigate the structural loss inherent in rigid dimensionality reduction, thereby reconciling realism with control consistency. Furthermore, to fully leverage DINOv3's high-resolution capabilities for enhancing control precision, we introduce a learnable Spatial Alignment Module that adapts these high-resolution features to the diffusion backbone. Finally, we propose a Causal Temporal Aggregator employing causal convolutions to explicitly preserve historical motion context when integrating frame-wise DINO features, which effectively mitigates motion blur and guarantees temporal stability.

Abstract: Insect vision supports complex behaviors including associative learning, navigation, and object detection, and has long motivated computational models for understanding biological visual processing. However, many contemporary models prioritize task performance while neglecting biologically grounded processing pathways. Here, we introduce a bio-inspired vision model that captures principles of the insect visual system to transform dense visual input into sparse, discriminative codes. The model is trained using a fully self-supervised contrastive objective, enabling representation learning without labeled data and supporting reuse across tasks without reliance on domain-specific classifiers. We evaluated the resulting representations on flower recognition tasks and natural image benchmarks. The model consistently produced reliable sparse codes that distinguish visually similar inputs. To support different modelling and deployment uses, we have implemented the model as both an artificial neural network and a spiking neural network. In a simulated localization setting, our approach outperformed a simple image downsampling comparison baseline, highlighting the functional benefit of incorporating neuromorphic visual processing pathways. Collectively, these results advance insect computational modelling by providing a generalizable bio-inspired vision model capable of sparse computation across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Implicit SDF-based methods for single-view 3D reconstruction achieve high-quality surfaces but require large labeled datasets, limiting their scalability. We propose MetaSSP, a novel semi-supervised framework that exploits abundant unlabeled images. Our approach introduces gradient-based parameter importance estimation to regularize adaptive EMA updates and an SDF-aware pseudo-label weighting mechanism combining augmentation consistency with SDF variance. Beginning with a 10% supervised warm-up, the unified pipeline jointly refines labeled and unlabeled data. On the Pix3D benchmark, our method reduces Chamfer Distance by approximately 20.61% and increases IoU by around 24.09% compared to existing semi-supervised baselines, setting a new state of the art.

Abstract: Generative models have achieved impressive fidelity in text-to-image synthesis, yet struggle with complex compositional prompts involving multiple constraints. We introduce \textbf{M3 (Multi-Modal, Multi-Agent, Multi-Round)}, a training-free framework that systematically resolves these failures through iterative inference-time refinement. M3 orchestrates off-the-shelf foundation models in a robust multi-agent loop: a Planner decomposes prompts into verifiable checklists, while specialized Checker, Refiner, and Editor agents surgically correct constraints one at a time, with a Verifier ensuring monotonic improvement. Applied to open-source models, M3 achieves remarkable results on the challenging OneIG-EN benchmark, with our Qwen-Image+M3 surpassing commercial flagship systems including Imagen4 (0.515) and Seedream 3.0 (0.530), reaching state-of-the-art performance (0.532 overall). This demonstrates that intelligent multi-agent reasoning can elevate open-source models beyond proprietary alternatives. M3 also substantially improves GenEval compositional metrics, effectively doubling spatial reasoning performance on hardened test sets. As a plug-and-play module compatible with any pre-trained T2I model, M3 establishes a new paradigm for compositional generation without costly retraining.

Abstract: Pelvic diseases in women of reproductive age represent a major global health burden, with diagnosis frequently delayed due to high anatomical variability, complicating MRI interpretation. Existing AI approaches are largely disease-specific and lack real-time compatibility, limiting generalizability and clinical integration. To address these challenges, we establish a benchmark framework for disease- and parameter-agnostic, real-time-compatible unsupervised anomaly detection in pelvic MRI. The method uses a residual variational autoencoder trained exclusively on healthy sagittal T2-weighted scans acquired across diverse imaging protocols to model normal pelvic anatomy. During inference, reconstruction error heatmaps indicate deviations from learned healthy structure, enabling detection of pathological regions without labeled abnormal data. The model is trained on 294 healthy scans and augmented with diffusion-generated synthetic data to improve robustness. Quantitative evaluation on the publicly available Uterine Myoma MRI Dataset yields an average area-under-the-curve (AUC) value of 0.736, with 0.828 sensitivity and 0.692 specificity. Additional inter-observer clinical evaluation extends analysis to endometrial cancer, endometriosis, and adenomyosis, revealing the influence of anatomical heterogeneity and inter-observer variability on performance interpretation. With a reconstruction time of approximately 92.6 frames per second, the proposed framework establishes a baseline for unsupervised anomaly detection in the female pelvis and supports future integration into real-time MRI. Code is available upon request (https://github.com/AniKnu/UADPelvis), prospective data sets are available for academic collaboration.

Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale CLIP-like vision-language models(VLMs) has greatly advanced medical image analysis. However, most existing medical VLMs still rely on coarse image-text contrastive objectives and fail to capture the systematic visual knowledge encoded in well-defined medical phenotype ontologies. To address this gap, we construct PhenoKG, the first large-scale, phenotype-centric multimodal knowledge graph that encompasses over 520K high-quality image-text pairs linked to more than 3,000 phenotypes. Building upon PhenoKG, we propose PhenoLIP, a novel pretraining framework that explicitly incorporates structured phenotype knowledge into medical VLMs through a two-stage process. We first learn a knowledge-enhanced phenotype embedding space from textual ontology data and then distill this structured knowledge into multimodal pretraining via a teacher-guided knowledge distillation objective. To support evaluation, we further introduce PhenoBench, an expert-verified benchmark designed for phenotype recognition, comprising over 7,800 image--caption pairs covering more than 1,000 phenotypes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhenoLIP outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines, improving upon BiomedCLIP in phenotype classification accuracy by 8.85\% and BIOMEDICA in cross-modal retrieval by 15.03%, underscoring the value of integrating phenotype-centric priors into medical VLMs for structured and interpretable medical image understanding.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a predominant alignment method for diffusion models, facilitating off-policy training without explicit reward modeling. However, its reliance on large-scale, high-quality human preference labels presents a severe cost and scalability bottleneck. To overcome this, We propose a semi-supervised framework augmenting limited human data with a large corpus of unlabeled pairs annotated via cost-effective synthetic AI feedback. Our paper introduces Debiased DPO (DeDPO), which uniquely integrates a debiased estimation technique from causal inference into the DPO objective. By explicitly identifying and correcting the systematic bias and noise inherent in synthetic annotators, DeDPO ensures robust learning from imperfect feedback sources, including self-training and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Experiments demonstrate that DeDPO is robust to the variations in synthetic labeling methods, achieving performance that matches and occasionally exceeds the theoretical upper bound of models trained on fully human-labeled data. This establishes DeDPO as a scalable solution for human-AI alignment using inexpensive synthetic supervision.

Abstract: We present AnyThermal, a thermal backbone that captures robust task-agnostic thermal features suitable for a variety of tasks such as cross-modal place recognition, thermal segmentation, and monocular depth estimation using thermal images. Existing thermal backbones that follow task-specific training from small-scale data result in utility limited to a specific environment and task. Unlike prior methods, AnyThermal can be used for a wide range of environments (indoor, aerial, off-road, urban) and tasks, all without task-specific training. Our key insight is to distill the feature representations from visual foundation models such as DINOv2 into a thermal encoder using thermal data from these multiple environments. To bridge the diversity gap of the existing RGB-Thermal datasets, we introduce the TartanRGBT platform, the first open-source data collection platform with synced RGB-Thermal image acquisition. We use this payload to collect the TartanRGBT dataset - a diverse and balanced dataset collected in 4 environments. We demonstrate the efficacy of AnyThermal and TartanRGBT, achieving state-of-the-art results with improvements of up to 36% across diverse environments and downstream tasks on existing datasets.

Abstract: Accurate 3D pose estimation of drones is essential for security and surveillance systems. However, existing methods often rely on prior drone information such as physical sizes or 3D meshes. At the same time, current datasets are small-scale, limited to single models, and collected under constrained environments, which makes reliable validation of generalization difficult. We present DroneKey++, a prior-free framework that jointly performs keypoint detection, drone classification, and 3D pose estimation. The framework employs a keypoint encoder for simultaneous keypoint detection and classification, and a pose decoder that estimates 3D pose using ray-based geometric reasoning and class embeddings. To address dataset limitations, we construct 6DroneSyn, a large-scale synthetic benchmark with over 50K images covering 7 drone models and 88 outdoor backgrounds, generated using 360-degree panoramic synthesis. Experiments show that DroneKey++ achieves MAE 17.34 deg and MedAE 17.1 deg for rotation, MAE 0.135 m and MedAE 0.242 m for translation, with inference speeds of 19.25 FPS (CPU) and 414.07 FPS (GPU), demonstrating both strong generalization across drone models and suitability for real-time applications. The dataset is publicly available.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: End-to-End Autonomous Driving (E2E-AD) systems are typically grouped by the nature of their outputs: (i) waypoint-based models that predict a future trajectory, and (ii) action-based models that directly output throttle, steer and brake. Most recent benchmark protocols and training pipelines are waypoint-based, which makes action-based policies harder to train and compare, slowing their progress. To bridge this waypoint-action gap, we propose a novel, differentiable vehicle-model framework that rolls out predicted action sequences to their corresponding ego-frame waypoint trajectories while supervising in waypoint space. Our approach enables action-based architectures to be trained and evaluated, for the first time, within waypoint-based benchmarks without modifying the underlying evaluation protocol. We extensively evaluate our framework across multiple challenging benchmarks and observe consistent improvements over the baselines. In particular, on NAVSIM \texttt{navhard} our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) align images and text with remarkable success, yet the geometry of their shared embedding space remains poorly understood. To probe this geometry, we begin from the Iso-Energy Assumption, which exploits cross-modal redundancy: a concept that is truly shared should exhibit the same average energy across modalities. We operationalize this assumption with an Aligned Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) that encourages energy consistency during training while preserving reconstruction. We find that this inductive bias changes the SAE solution without harming reconstruction, giving us a representation that serves as a tool for geometric analysis. Sanity checks on controlled data with known ground truth confirm that alignment improves when Iso-Energy holds and remains neutral when it does not. Applied to foundational VLMs, our framework reveals a clear structure with practical consequences: (i) sparse bimodal atoms carry the entire cross-modal alignment signal; (ii) unimodal atoms act as modality-specific biases and fully explain the modality gap; (iii) removing unimodal atoms collapses the gap without harming performance; (iv) restricting vector arithmetic to the bimodal subspace yields in-distribution edits and improved retrieval. These findings suggest that the right inductive bias can both preserve model fidelity and render the latent geometry interpretable and actionable.

Abstract: The ubiquity of monocular videos capturing daily hand-object interactions presents a valuable resource for embodied intelligence. While 3D hand reconstruction from in-the-wild videos has seen significant progress, reconstructing the involved objects remains challenging due to severe occlusions and the complex, coupled motion of the camera, hands, and object. In this paper, we introduce ForeHOI, a novel feed-forward model that directly reconstructs 3D object geometry from monocular hand-object interaction videos within one minute of inference time, eliminating the need for any pre-processing steps. Our key insight is that, the joint prediction of 2D mask inpainting and 3D shape completion in a feed-forward framework can effectively address the problem of severe occlusion in monocular hand-held object videos, thereby achieving results that outperform the performance of optimization-based methods. The information exchanges between the 2D and 3D shape completion boosts the overall reconstruction quality, enabling the framework to effectively handle severe hand-object occlusion. Furthermore, to support the training of our model, we contribute the first large-scale, high-fidelity synthetic dataset of hand-object interactions with comprehensive annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ForeHOI achieves state-of-the-art performance in object reconstruction, significantly outperforming previous methods with around a 100x speedup.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown remarkable success in skeleton-based action recognition by leveraging data augmentations to learn meaningful representations. However, existing SSL methods rely on data augmentations that predominantly focus on masking high-motion frames and high-degree joints such as joints with degree 3 or 4. This results in biased and incomplete feature representations that struggle to generalize across varied motion patterns. To address this, we propose Asymmetric Spatio-temporal Masking (ASMa) for Skeleton Action Representation Learning, a novel combination of masking to learn a full spectrum of spatio-temporal dynamics inherent in human actions. ASMa employs two complementary masking strategies: one that selectively masks high-degree joints and low-motion, and another that masks low-degree joints and high-motion frames. These masking strategies ensure a more balanced and comprehensive skeleton representation learning. Furthermore, we introduce a learnable feature alignment module to effectively align the representations learned from both masked views. To facilitate deployment in resource-constrained settings and on low-resource devices, we compress the learned and aligned representation into a lightweight model using knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing SSL methods with an average improvement of 2.7-4.4% in fine-tuning and up to 5.9% in transfer learning to noisy datasets and achieves competitive performance compared to fully supervised baselines. Our distilled model achieves 91.4% parameter reduction and 3x faster inference on edge devices while maintaining competitive accuracy, enabling practical deployment in resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Kabuki syndrome (KS) and Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WSS) are rare but distinct developmental disorders that share overlapping clinical features, including neurodevelopmental delay, growth restriction, and persistent fetal fingertip pads. While genetic testing remains the diagnostic gold standard, many individuals with KS or WSS remain undiagnosed due to barriers in access to both genetic testing and expertise. Dermatoglyphic anomalies, despite being established hallmarks of several genetic syndromes, remain an underutilized diagnostic signal in the era of molecular testing. This study presents a vision transformer-based deep learning model that leverages fingerprint images to distinguish individuals with KS and WSS from unaffected controls and from one another. We evaluate model performance across three binary classification tasks. Across the three classification tasks, the model achieved AUC scores of 0.80 (control vs. KS), 0.73 (control vs. WSS), and 0.85 (KS vs. WSS), with corresponding F1 scores of 0.71, 0.72, and 0.83, respectively. Beyond classification, we apply attention-based visualizations to identify fingerprint regions most salient to model predictions, enhancing interpretability. Together, these findings suggest the presence of syndrome-specific fingerprint features, demonstrating the feasibility of a fingerprint-based artificial intelligence (AI) tool as a noninvasive, interpretable, and accessible future diagnostic aid for the early diagnosis of underdiagnosed genetic syndromes.

Abstract: Recent research in geospatial machine learning has demonstrated that models pretrained with self-supervised learning on Earth observation data can perform well on downstream tasks with limited training data. However, most of the existing geospatial benchmark datasets have few data modalities and poor global representation, limiting the ability to evaluate multimodal pretrained models at global scales. To fill this gap, we introduce MMEarth-Bench, a collection of five new multimodal environmental tasks with 12 modalities, globally distributed data, and both in- and out-of-distribution test splits. We benchmark a diverse set of pretrained models and find that while (multimodal) pretraining tends to improve model robustness in limited data settings, geographic generalization abilities remain poor. In order to facilitate model adaptation to new downstream tasks and geographic domains, we propose a model-agnostic method for test-time training with multimodal reconstruction (TTT-MMR) that uses all the modalities available at test time as auxiliary tasks, regardless of whether a pretrained model accepts them as input. Our method improves model performance on both the random and geographic test splits, and geographic batching leads to a good trade-off between regularization and specialization during TTT. Our dataset, code, and visualization tool are linked from the project page at lgordon99.github.io/mmearth-bench.

Abstract: Surgical navigation based on multimodal image registration has played a significant role in providing intraoperative guidance to surgeons by showing the relative position of the target area to critical anatomical structures during surgery. However, due to the differences between multimodal images and intraoperative image deformation caused by tissue displacement and removal during the surgery, effective registration of preoperative and intraoperative multimodal images faces significant challenges. To address the multimodal image registration challenges in Learn2Reg 2025, an unsupervised multimodal medical image registration method based on multilevel correlation pyramidal optimization (MCPO) is designed to solve these problems. First, the features of each modality are extracted based on the modality independent neighborhood descriptor, and the multimodal images is mapped to the feature space. Second, a multilevel pyramidal fusion optimization mechanism is designed to achieve global optimization and local detail complementation of the displacement field through dense correlation analysis and weight-balanced coupled convex optimization for input features at different scales. Our method focuses on the ReMIND2Reg task in Learn2Reg 2025. Based on the results, our method achieved the first place in the validation phase and test phase of ReMIND2Reg.

Abstract: With the advancement of deep learning technologies, specialized neural processing hardware such as Brain Processing Units (BPUs) have emerged as dedicated platforms for CNN acceleration, offering optimized INT8 computation capabilities for convolutional operations. Meanwhile, Vision Transformer (ViT) models, such as the Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT), have demonstrated superior performance and play increasingly crucial roles in computer vision tasks. However, due to the architectural mismatch between CNN-optimized hardware and Vision Transformer computation characteristics--namely, that linear layers in Transformers operate on three-dimensional data while BPU acceleration is designed for four-dimensional convolution operations-it is difficult or even impossible to leverage BPU's advantages when deploying Vision Transformers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that restructures the Vision Transformer by replacing linear layers and layer normalization operations with carefully designed convolutional operators. This enables DeiT to fully utilize the acceleration capabilities of BPUs, while allowing the original weight parameters to be inherited by the restructured models without retraining or fine-tuning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful deployment of Vision Transformers that fully leverages BPU classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, the quantized DeiT-Base model achieves 80.4% accuracy on ImageNet, compared to the original 81.8%, while obtaining up to a 3.8* inference speedup. Our finetuned DeiT model on the flower classification dataset also achieves excellent performance, with only a 0.5% accuracy drop for the DeiT-Base model, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Continual test-time domain adaptation (CTTA) aims to adjust models so that they can perform well over time across non-stationary environments. While previous methods have made considerable efforts to optimize the adaptation process, a crucial question remains: Can the model adapt to continually changing environments over a long time? In this work, we explore facilitating better CTTA in the long run using a re-initialization (or reset) based method. First, we observe that the long-term performance is associated with the trajectory pattern in label flip. Based on this observed correlation, we propose a simple yet effective policy, Adaptive-and-Balanced Re-initialization (ABR), towards preserving the model's long-term performance. In particular, ABR performs weight re-initialization using adaptive intervals. The adaptive interval is determined based on the change in label flip. The proposed method is validated on extensive CTTA benchmarks, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Efficient and robust Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is paramount for safety-critical applications.However, existing methods still execute full-scale inference on low-level statistical noise. This computational mismatch not only incurs resource waste but also induces semantic hallucination, where deep networks forcefully interpret physical anomalies as high-confidence semantic features.To address this, we propose the Cascaded Early Rejection (CER) framework, which realizes hierarchical filtering for anomaly detection via a coarse-to-fine logic.CER comprises two core modules: 1)Structural Energy Sieve (SES), which establishes a non-parametric barrier at the network entry using the Laplacian operator to efficiently intercept physical signal anomalies; and 2) the Semantically-aware Hyperspherical Energy (SHE) detector, which decouples feature magnitude from direction in intermediate layers to identify fine-grained semantic deviations. Experimental results demonstrate that CER not only reduces computational overhead by 32% but also achieves a significant performance leap on the CIFAR-100 benchmark:the average FPR95 drastically decreases from 33.58% to 22.84%, and AUROC improves to 93.97%. Crucially, in real-world scenarios simulating sensor failures, CER exhibits performance far exceeding state-of-the-art methods. As a universal plugin, CER can be seamlessly integrated into various SOTA models to provide performance gains.

Abstract: The recent introduction of \texttt{SAM3} has revolutionized Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) through \textit{promptable concept segmentation}, which grounds pixel predictions in flexible concept prompts. However, this reliance on pre-defined concepts makes the model vulnerable: when visual distributions shift (\textit{data drift}) or conditional label distributions evolve (\textit{concept drift}) in the target domain, the alignment between visual evidence and prompts breaks down. In this work, we present \textsc{ConceptBank}, a parameter-free calibration framework to restore this alignment on the fly. Instead of adhering to static prompts, we construct a dataset-specific concept bank from the target statistics. Our approach (\textit{i}) anchors target-domain evidence via class-wise visual prototypes, (\textit{ii}) mines representative supports to suppress outliers under data drift, and (\textit{iii}) fuses candidate concepts to rectify concept drift. We demonstrate that \textsc{ConceptBank} effectively adapts \texttt{SAM3} to distribution drifts, including challenging natural-scene and remote-sensing scenarios, establishing a new baseline for robustness and efficiency in OVS.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recently, Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated strong generalizability in various instance segmentation tasks. However, its performance is severely dependent on the quality of manual prompts. In addition, the RGB images that instance segmentation methods normally use inherently lack depth information. As a result, the ability of these methods to perceive spatial structures and delineate object boundaries is hindered. To address these challenges, we propose a Self-prompted Depth-Aware SAM (SPDA-SAM) for instance segmentation. Specifically, we design a Semantic-Spatial Self-prompt Module (SSSPM) which extracts the semantic and spatial prompts from the image encoder and the mask decoder of SAM, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce a Coarse-to-Fine RGB-D Fusion Module (C2FFM), in which the features extracted from a monocular RGB image and the depth map estimated from it are fused. In particular, the structural information in the depth map is used to provide coarse-grained guidance to feature fusion, while local variations in depth are encoded in order to fuse fine-grained feature representations. To our knowledge, SAM has not been explored in such self-prompted and depth-aware manners. Experimental results demonstrate that our SPDA-SAM outperforms its state-of-the-art counterparts across twelve different data sets. These promising results should be due to the guidance of the self-prompts and the compensation for the spatial information loss by the coarse-to-fine RGB-D fusion operation.

Abstract: High-fidelity rendering of dynamic humans from monocular videos typically degrades catastrophically under occlusions. Existing solutions incorporate external priors-either hallucinating missing content via generative models, which induces severe temporal flickering, or imposing rigid geometric heuristics that fail to capture diverse appearances. To this end, we reformulate the task as a Maximum A Posteriori estimation problem under heteroscedastic observation noise. In this paper, we propose U-4DGS, a framework integrating a Probabilistic Deformation Network and a Double Rasterization pipeline. This architecture renders pixel-aligned uncertainty maps that act as an adaptive gradient modulator, automatically attenuating artifacts from unreliable observations. Furthermore, to prevent geometric drift in regions lacking reliable visual cues, we enforce Confidence-Aware Regularizations, which leverage the learned uncertainty to selectively propagate spatial-temporal validity. Extensive experiments on ZJU-MoCap and OcMotion demonstrate that U-4DGS achieves SOTA rendering fidelity and robustness.

Abstract: Fast flow models accelerate the iterative sampling process by learning to directly predict ODE path integrals, enabling one-step or few-step generation. However, we argue that current fast-flow training paradigms suffer from two fundamental issues. First, conditional velocities constructed from randomly paired noise-data samples introduce systematic trajectory drift, preventing models from following a consistent ODE path. Second, the model's approximation errors accumulate over time steps, leading to severe deviations across long time intervals. To address these issues, we propose FlowConsist, a training framework designed to enforce trajectory consistency in fast flows. We propose a principled alternative that replaces conditional velocities with the marginal velocities predicted by the model itself, aligning optimization with the true trajectory. To further address error accumulation over time steps, we introduce a trajectory rectification strategy that aligns the marginal distributions of generated and real samples at every time step along the trajectory. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on ImageNet 256$\times$256, achieving an FID of 1.52 with only 1 sampling step.

Abstract: Existing methods for preference tuning of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often rely on computationally expensive generation steps to create positive and negative pairs of images. These approaches frequently yield training pairs that either lack meaningful differences, are expensive to sample and filter, or exhibit significant variance in irrelevant pixel regions, thereby degrading training efficiency. To address these limitations, we introduce "Di3PO", a novel method for constructing positive and negative pairs that isolates specific regions targeted for improvement during preference tuning, while keeping the surrounding context in the image stable. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by applying it to the challenging task of text rendering in diffusion models, showcasing improvements over baseline methods of SFT and DPO.

Abstract: Existing cross-modal pedestrian detection (CMPD) employs complementary information from RGB and thermal-infrared (TIR) modalities to detect pedestrians in 24h-surveillance systems.RGB captures rich pedestrian details under daylight, while TIR excels at night. However, TIR focuses primarily on the person's silhouette, neglecting critical texture details essential for detection. While the near-infrared (NIR) captures texture under low-light conditions, which effectively alleviates performance issues of RGB and detail loss in TIR, thereby reducing missed detections. To this end, we construct a new Triplet RGB-NIR-TIR (TRNT) dataset, comprising 8,281 pixel-aligned image triplets, establishing a comprehensive foundation for algorithmic research. However, due to the variable nature of real-world scenarios, imaging devices may not always capture all three modalities simultaneously. This results in input data with unpredictable combinations of modal types, which challenge existing CMPD methods that fail to extract robust pedestrian information under arbitrary input combinations, leading to significant performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Uncertainty-aware Network (AUNet) for accurately discriminating modal availability and fully utilizing the available information under uncertain inputs. Specifically, we introduce Unified Modality Validation Refinement (UMVR), which includes an uncertainty-aware router to validate modal availability and a semantic refinement to ensure the reliability of information within the modality. Furthermore, we design a Modality-Aware Interaction (MAI) module to adaptively activate or deactivate its internal interaction mechanisms per UMVR output, enabling effective complementary information fusion from available modalities.

Abstract: Salient object detection is inherently a subjective problem, as observers with different priors may perceive different objects as salient. However, existing methods predominantly formulate it as an objective prediction task with a single groundtruth segmentation map for each image, which renders the problem under-determined and fundamentally ill-posed. To address this issue, we propose Observer-Centric Salient Object Detection (OC-SOD), where salient regions are predicted by considering not only the visual cues but also the observer-specific factors such as their preferences or intents. As a result, this formulation captures the intrinsic ambiguity and diversity of human perception, enabling personalized and context-aware saliency prediction. By leveraging multi-modal large language models, we develop an efficient data annotation pipeline and construct the first OC-SOD dataset named OC-SODBench, comprising 33k training, validation and test images with 152k textual prompts and object pairs. Built upon this new dataset, we further design OC-SODAgent, an agentic baseline which performs OC-SOD via a human-like "Perceive-Reflect-Adjust" process. Extensive experiments on our proposed OC-SODBench have justified the effectiveness of our contribution. Through this observer-centric perspective, we aim to bridge the gap between human perception and computational modeling, offering a more realistic and flexible understanding of what makes an object truly "salient."

Abstract: Efficient neural networks are essential for scaling machine learning models to real-time applications and resource-constrained environments. Fully-connected feedforward layers (FFLs) introduce computation and parameter count bottlenecks within neural network architectures. To address this challenge, in this work, we propose a new class of dense layers that generalize standard fully-connected feedforward layers, \textbf{E}fficient, \textbf{U}nified and \textbf{Gen}eral dense layers (EUGens). EUGens leverage random features to approximate standard FFLs and go beyond them by incorporating a direct dependence on the input norms in their computations. The proposed layers unify existing efficient FFL extensions and improve efficiency by reducing inference complexity from quadratic to linear time. They also lead to \textbf{the first} unbiased algorithms approximating FFLs with arbitrary polynomial activation functions. Furthermore, EuGens reduce the parameter count and computational overhead while preserving the expressive power and adaptability of FFLs. We also present a layer-wise knowledge transfer technique that bypasses backpropagation, enabling efficient adaptation of EUGens to pre-trained models. Empirically, we observe that integrating EUGens into Transformers and MLPs yields substantial improvements in inference speed (up to \textbf{27}\%) and memory efficiency (up to \textbf{30}\%) across a range of tasks, including image classification, language model pre-training, and 3D scene reconstruction. Overall, our results highlight the potential of EUGens for the scalable deployment of large-scale neural networks in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of vision-language models has catalyzed the emergence of GUI agents, which hold immense potential for automating complex tasks, from online shopping to flight booking, thereby alleviating the burden of repetitive digital workflows. As a foundational capability, GUI grounding is typically established as a prerequisite for end-to-end task execution. It enables models to precisely locate interface elements, such as text and icons, to perform accurate operations like clicking and typing. Unlike prior works that fine-tune models already possessing strong spatial awareness (e.g., Qwen3-VL), we aim to master the full technical pipeline by starting from a base model with minimal grounding ability, such as POINTS-1.5. We introduce POINTS-GUI-G-8B, which achieves state-of-the-art performance with scores of 59.9 on ScreenSpot-Pro, 66.0 on OSWorld-G, 95.7 on ScreenSpot-v2, and 49.9 on UI-Vision. Our model's success is driven by three key factors: (1) Refined Data Engineering, involving the unification of diverse open-source datasets format alongside sophisticated strategies for augmentation, filtering, and difficulty grading; (2) Improved Training Strategies, including continuous fine-tuning of the vision encoder to enhance perceptual accuracy and maintaining resolution consistency between training and inference; and (3) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Verifiable Rewards. While RL is traditionally used to bolster reasoning, we demonstrate that it significantly improves precision in the perception-intensive GUI grounding task. Furthermore, GUI grounding provides a natural advantage for RL, as rewards are easily verifiable and highly accurate.

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction enables autonomous vehicles (AVs) to perceive fine-grained geometric and semantic structure of their surroundings from onboard sensors, which is essential for safe decision-making and navigation. Recent models for 3D semantic occupancy prediction have successfully addressed the challenge of describing real-world objects with varied shapes and classes. However, the intermediate representations used by existing methods for 3D semantic occupancy prediction rely heavily on 3D voxel volumes or a set of 3D Gaussians, hindering the model's ability to efficiently and effectively capture fine-grained geometric details in the 3D driving environment. This paper introduces TFusionOcc, a novel object-centric multi-sensor fusion framework for predicting 3D semantic occupancy. By leveraging multi-stage multi-sensor fusion, Student's t-distribution, and the T-Mixture model (TMM), together with more geometrically flexible primitives, such as the deformable superquadric (superquadric with inverse warp), the proposed method achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the nuScenes benchmark. In addition, extensive experiments were conducted on the nuScenes-C dataset to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method in different camera and lidar corruption scenarios.

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D object detectors often struggle to detect far-field objects due to the sparsity of point clouds at long ranges, which limits the availability of reliable geometric cues. To address this, prior approaches augment LiDAR data with depth-completed virtual points derived from RGB images; however, directly incorporating all virtual points leads to increased computational cost and introduces challenges in effectively fusing real and virtual information. We present Point Virtual Transformer (PointViT), a transformer-based 3D object detection framework that jointly reasons over raw LiDAR points and selectively sampled virtual points. The framework examines multiple fusion strategies, ranging from early point-level fusion to BEV-based gated fusion, and analyses their trade-offs in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The fused point cloud is voxelized and encoded using sparse convolutions to form a BEV representation, from which a compact set of high-confidence object queries is initialised and refined through a transformer-based context aggregation module. Experiments on the KITTI benchmark report 91.16% 3D AP, 95.94% BEV AP, and 99.36% AP on the KITTI 2D detection benchmark for the Car class.

Abstract: Human visual attention on three-dimensional objects emerges from the interplay between bottom-up geometric processing and top-down semantic recognition. Existing 3D saliency methods rely on hand-crafted geometric features or learning-based approaches that lack semantic awareness, failing to explain why humans fixate on semantically meaningful but geometrically unremarkable regions. We introduce SemGeo-AttentionNet, a dual-stream architecture that explicitly formalizes this dichotomy through asymmetric cross-modal fusion, leveraging diffusion-based semantic priors from geometry-conditioned multi-view rendering and point cloud transformers for geometric processing. Cross-attention ensures geometric features query semantic content, enabling bottom-up distinctiveness to guide top-down retrieval. We extend our framework to temporal scanpath generation through reinforcement learning, introducing the first formulation respecting 3D mesh topology with inhibition-of-return dynamics. Evaluation on SAL3D, NUS3D and 3DVA datasets demonstrates substantial improvements, validating how cognitively motivated architectures effectively model human visual attention on three-dimensional surfaces.

Abstract: Deploying GRPO on Flow Matching models has proven effective for text-to-image generation. However, existing paradigms typically propagate an outcome-based reward to all preceding denoising steps without distinguishing the local effect of each step. Moreover, current group-wise ranking mainly compares trajectories at matched timesteps and ignores within-trajectory dependencies, where certain early denoising actions can affect later states via delayed, implicit interactions. We propose TurningPoint-GRPO (TP-GRPO), a GRPO framework that alleviates step-wise reward sparsity and explicitly models long-term effects within the denoising trajectory. TP-GRPO makes two key innovations: (i) it replaces outcome-based rewards with step-level incremental rewards, providing a dense, step-aware learning signal that better isolates each denoising action's "pure" effect, and (ii) it identifies turning points-steps that flip the local reward trend and make subsequent reward evolution consistent with the overall trajectory trend-and assigns these actions an aggregated long-term reward to capture their delayed impact. Turning points are detected solely via sign changes in incremental rewards, making TP-GRPO efficient and hyperparameter-free. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that TP-GRPO exploits reward signals more effectively and consistently improves generation. Demo code is available at https://github.com/YunzeTong/TurningPoint-GRPO.

(VIO) systems rely on point features for motion estimation and localization. However, their performance degrades in challenging scenarios. Moreover, the localization accuracy of multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF)-based VIO systems suffers from linearization errors associated with feature 3D coordinates and delayed measurement updates. To improve the performance of VIO in challenging scenes, we first propose a pose-only geometric representation for line features. Building on this, we develop POPL-KF, a Kalman filter-based VIO system that employs a pose-only geometric representation for both point and line features. POPL-KF mitigates linearization errors by explicitly eliminating both point and line feature coordinates from the measurement equations, while enabling immediate update of visual measurements. We also design a unified base-frames selection algorithm for both point and line features to ensure optimal constraints on camera poses within the pose-only measurement model. To further improve line feature quality, a line feature filter based on image grid segmentation and bidirectional optical flow consistency is proposed. Our system is evaluated on public datasets and real-world experiments, demonstrating that POPL-KF outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) filter-based methods (OpenVINS, PO-KF) and optimization-based methods (PL-VINS, EPLF-VINS), while maintaining real-time performance.

Abstract: Embodied navigation holds significant promise for real-world applications such as last-mile delivery. However, most existing approaches are confined to either indoor or outdoor environments and rely heavily on strong assumptions, such as access to precise coordinate systems. While current outdoor methods can guide agents to the vicinity of a target using coarse-grained localization, they fail to enable fine-grained entry through specific building entrances, critically limiting their utility in practical deployment scenarios that require seamless outdoor-to-indoor transitions. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task: out-to-in prior-free instruction-driven embodied navigation. This formulation explicitly eliminates reliance on accurate external priors, requiring agents to navigate solely based on egocentric visual observations guided by instructions. To tackle this task, we propose a vision-centric embodied navigation framework that leverages image-based prompts to drive decision-making. Additionally, we present the first open-source dataset for this task, featuring a pipeline that integrates trajectory-conditioned video synthesis into the data generation process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across key metrics including success rate and path efficiency.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) have achieved remarkable progress yet remain constrained by a single-turn interaction paradigm, effectively functioning as solvers for independent requests rather than assistants in continuous dialogue. To bridge this gap, we present ChatUMM. As a conversational unified model, it excels at robust context tracking to sustain interleaved multimodal generation. ChatUMM derives its capabilities from two key innovations: an interleaved multi-turn training strategy that models serialized text-image streams as a continuous conversational flow, and a systematic conversational data synthesis pipeline. This pipeline transforms a diverse set of standard single-turn datasets into fluid dialogues through three progressive stages: constructing basic stateful dialogues, enforcing long-range dependency resolution via ``distractor'' turns with history-dependent query rewriting, and synthesizing naturally interleaved multimodal responses. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ChatUMM achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source unified models on visual understanding and instruction-guided editing benchmarks, while maintaining competitive fidelity in text-to-image generation. Notably, ChatUMM exhibits superior robustness in complex multi-turn scenarios, ensuring fluid, context-aware dialogues.

Abstract: Large-scale and categorical-balanced text data is essential for training effective Scene Text Recognition (STR) models, which is hard to achieve when collecting real data. Synthetic data offers a cost-effective and perfectly labeled alternative. However, its performance often lags behind, revealing a significant domain gap between real and current synthetic data. In this work, we systematically analyze mainstream rendering-based synthetic datasets and identify their key limitations: insufficient diversity in corpus, font, and layout, which restricts their realism in complex scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce UnionST, a strong data engine synthesizes text covering a union of challenging samples and better aligns with the complexity observed in the wild. We then construct UnionST-S, a large-scale synthetic dataset with improved simulations in challenging scenarios. Furthermore, we develop a self-evolution learning (SEL) framework for effective real data annotation. Experiments show that models trained on UnionST-S achieve significant improvements over existing synthetic datasets. They even surpass real-data performance in certain scenarios. Moreover, when using SEL, the trained models achieve competitive performance by only seeing 9% of real data labels.

Abstract: Detecting deepfakes has become increasingly challenging as forgery faces synthesized by AI-generated methods, particularly diffusion models, achieve unprecedented quality and resolution. Existing forgery detection approaches relying on spatial and frequency features demonstrate limited efficacy against high-quality, entirely synthesized forgeries. In this paper, we propose a novel detection method grounded in the observation that facial attributes governed by complex physical laws and multiple parameters are inherently difficult to replicate. Specifically, we focus on illumination, particularly the specular reflection component in the Phong illumination model, which poses the greatest replication challenge due to its parametric complexity and nonlinear formulation. We introduce a fast and accurate face texture estimation method based on Retinex theory to enable precise specular reflection separation. Furthermore, drawing from the mathematical formulation of specular reflection, we posit that forgery evidence manifests not only in the specular reflection itself but also in its relationship with corresponding face texture and direct light. To address this issue, we design the Specular-Reflection-Inconsistency-Network (SRI-Net), incorporating a two-stage cross-attention mechanism to capture these correlations and integrate specular reflection related features with image features for robust forgery detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on both traditional deepfake datasets and generative deepfake datasets, particularly those containing diffusion-generated forgery faces.

Abstract: Foundation object detectors such as GLIP and Grounding DINO excel on general-domain data but often degrade in specialized and data-scarce settings like underwater imagery or industrial defects. Typical cross-domain few-shot approaches rely on fine-tuning scarce target data, incurring cost and overfitting risks. We instead ask: Can a frozen detector adapt with only one exemplar per class without training? To answer this, we introduce training-free one-shot domain generalization for object detection, where detectors must adapt to specialized domains with only one annotated exemplar per class and no weight updates. To tackle this task, we propose LAB-Det, which exploits Language As a domain-invariant Bridge. Instead of adapting visual features, we project each exemplar into a descriptive text that conditions and guides a frozen detector. This linguistic conditioning replaces gradient-based adaptation, enabling robust generalization in data-scarce domains. We evaluate on UODD (underwater) and NEU-DET (industrial defects), two widely adopted benchmarks for data-scarce detection, where object boundaries are often ambiguous, and LAB-Det achieves up to 5.4 mAP improvement over state-of-the-art fine-tuned baselines without updating a single parameter. These results establish linguistic adaptation as an efficient and interpretable alternative to fine-tuning in specialized detection settings.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving has recently attracted increasing interest in unifying Vision-Language-Action (VLA) with World Models to enhance decision-making and forward-looking imagination. However, existing methods fail to effectively unify future scene evolution and action planning within a single architecture due to inadequate sharing of latent states, limiting the impact of visual imagination on action decisions. To address this limitation, we propose DriveWorld-VLA, a novel framework that unifies world modeling and planning within a latent space by tightly integrating VLA and world models at the representation level, which enables the VLA planner to benefit directly from holistic scene-evolution modeling and reducing reliance on dense annotated supervision. Additionally, DriveWorld-VLA incorporates the latent states of the world model as core decision-making states for the VLA planner, facilitating the planner to assess how candidate actions impact future scene evolution. By conducting world modeling entirely in the latent space, DriveWorld-VLA supports controllable, action-conditioned imagination at the feature level, avoiding expensive pixel-level rollouts. Extensive open-loop and closed-loop evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of DriveWorld-VLA, which achieves state-of-the-art performance with 91.3 PDMS on NAVSIMv1, 86.8 EPDMS on NAVSIMv2, and 0.16 3-second average collision rate on nuScenes. Code and models will be released in https://github.com/liulin815/DriveWorld-VLA.git.

Abstract: Feedforward models for novel view synthesis (NVS) have recently advanced by transformer-based methods like LVSM, using attention among all input and target views. In this work, we argue that its full self-attention design is suboptimal, suffering from quadratic complexity with respect to the number of input views and rigid parameter sharing among heterogeneous tokens. We propose Efficient-LVSM, a dual-stream architecture that avoids these issues with a decoupled co-refinement mechanism. It applies intra-view self-attention for input views and self-then-cross attention for target views, eliminating unnecessary computation. Efficient-LVSM achieves 29.86 dB PSNR on RealEstate10K with 2 input views, surpassing LVSM by 0.2 dB, with 2x faster training convergence and 4.4x faster inference speed. Efficient-LVSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to unseen view counts, and enables incremental inference with KV-cache, thanks to its decoupled designs.

Abstract: Reliable benchmarking is critical for advancing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, as it reveals their generalization, robustness, and alignment of perception with language-driven manipulation tasks. However, existing benchmarks often provide limited or misleading assessments due to insufficient evaluation protocols that inadequately capture real-world distribution shifts. This work systematically rethinks VLA benchmarking from both evaluation and data perspectives, introducing LIBERO-X, a benchmark featuring: 1) A hierarchical evaluation protocol with progressive difficulty levels targeting three core capabilities: spatial generalization, object recognition, and task instruction understanding. This design enables fine-grained analysis of performance degradation under increasing environmental and task complexity; 2) A high-diversity training dataset collected via human teleoperation, where each scene supports multiple fine-grained manipulation objectives to bridge the train-evaluation distribution gap. Experiments with representative VLA models reveal significant performance drops under cumulative perturbations, exposing persistent limitations in scene comprehension and instruction grounding. By integrating hierarchical evaluation with diverse training data, LIBERO-X offers a more reliable foundation for assessing and advancing VLA development.

Abstract: While Domain Adaptive Object Detection (DAOD) has made significant strides, most methods rely on unlabeled target data that is assumed to contain sufficient foreground instances. However, in many practical scenarios (e.g., wildlife monitoring, lesion detection), collecting target domain data with objects of interest is prohibitively costly, whereas background-only data is abundant. This common practical constraint introduces a significant technical challenge: the difficulty of achieving domain alignment when target instances are unavailable, forcing adaptation to rely solely on the target background information. We formulate this challenge as the novel problem of Instance-Free Domain Adaptive Object Detection. To tackle this, we propose the Relational and Structural Consistency Network (RSCN) which pioneers an alignment strategy based on background feature prototypes while simultaneously encouraging consistency in the relationship between the source foreground features and the background features within each domain, enabling robust adaptation even without target instances. To facilitate research, we further curate three specialized benchmarks, including simulative auto-driving detection, wildlife detection, and lung nodule detection. Extensive experiments show that RSCN significantly outperforms existing DAOD methods across all three benchmarks in the instance-free scenario. The code and benchmarks will be released soon.

Abstract: Inferring the 3D structure from a single image, particularly in occluded regions, remains a fundamental yet unsolved challenge in vision-centric autonomous driving. Existing unsupervised approaches typically train a neural radiance field and treat the network outputs as occupancy probabilities during evaluation, overlooking the inconsistency between training and evaluation protocols. Moreover, the prevalent use of 2D ground truth fails to reveal the inherent ambiguity in occluded regions caused by insufficient geometric constraints. To address these issues, this paper presents a reformulated benchmark for unsupervised monocular 3D occupancy prediction. We first interpret the variables involved in the volume rendering process and identify the most physically consistent representation of the occupancy probability. Building on these analyses, we improve existing evaluation protocols by aligning the newly identified representation with voxel-wise 3D occupancy ground truth, thereby enabling unsupervised methods to be evaluated in a manner consistent with that of supervised approaches. Additionally, to impose explicit constraints in occluded regions, we introduce an occlusion-aware polarization mechanism that incorporates multi-view visual cues to enhance discrimination between occupied and free spaces in these regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only significantly outperforms existing unsupervised approaches but also matches the performance of supervised ones. Our source code and evaluation protocol will be made available upon publication.

Abstract: In modern interior design, the generation of personalized spaces frequently necessitates a delicate balance between rigid architectural structural constraints and specific stylistic preferences. However, existing multi-condition generative frameworks often struggle to harmonize these inputs, leading to "condition conflicts" where stylistic attributes inadvertently compromise the geometric precision of the layout. To address this challenge, we present DreamHome-Pano, a controllable panoramic generation framework designed for high-fidelity interior synthesis. Our approach introduces a Prompt-LLM that serves as a semantic bridge, effectively translating layout constraints and style references into professional descriptive prompts to achieve precise cross-modal alignment. To safeguard architectural integrity during the generative process, we develop a Conflict-Free Control architecture that incorporates structural-aware geometric priors and a multi-condition decoupling strategy, effectively suppressing stylistic interference from eroding the spatial layout. Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive panoramic interior benchmark alongside a multi-stage training pipeline, encompassing progressive Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Experimental results demonstrate that DreamHome-Pano achieves a superior balance between aesthetic quality and structural consistency, offering a robust and professional-grade solution for panoramic interior visualization.

Abstract: Large-scale, high-resolution forest canopy height mapping plays a crucial role in understanding regional and global carbon and water cycles. Spaceborne LiDAR missions, including the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) and the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), provide global observations of forest structure but are spatially sparse and subject to inherent uncertainties. In contrast, near-surface LiDAR platforms, such as airborne and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) LiDAR systems, offer much finer measurements of forest canopy structure, and a growing number of countries have made these datasets openly available. In this study, a state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation model, Depth Anything V2, was trained using approximately 16,000 km2 of canopy height models (CHMs) derived from publicly available airborne LiDAR point clouds and related products across multiple countries, together with 3 m resolution PlanetScope and airborne RGB imagery. The trained model, referred to as Depth2CHM, enables the estimation of spatially continuous CHMs directly from PlanetScope RGB imagery. Independent validation was conducted at sites in China (approximately 1 km2) and the United States (approximately 116 km2). The results showed that Depth2CHM could accurately estimate canopy height, with biases of 0.59 m and 0.41 m and root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 2.54 m and 5.75 m for these two sites, respectively. Compared with an existing global meter-resolution CHM product, the mean absolute error is reduced by approximately 1.5 m and the RMSE by approximately 2 m. These results demonstrated that monocular depth estimation networks trained with large-scale airborne LiDAR-derived canopy height data provide a promising and scalable pathway for high-resolution, spatially continuous forest canopy height estimation from satellite RGB imagery.

Abstract: Converting raster floorplans into engineering-grade vector graphics is challenging due to complex topology and strict geometric constraints. To address this, we present FloorplanVLM, a unified framework that reformulates floorplan vectorization as an image-conditioned sequence modeling task. Unlike pixel-based methods that rely on fragile heuristics or query-based transformers that generate fragmented rooms, our model directly outputs structured JSON sequences representing the global topology. This 'pixels-to-sequence' paradigm enables the precise and holistic constraint satisfaction of complex geometries, such as slanted walls and curved arcs. To support this data-hungry approach, we introduce a scalable data engine: we construct a large-scale dataset (Floorplan-2M) and a high-fidelity subset (Floorplan-HQ-300K) to balance geometric diversity and pixel-level precision. We then employ a progressive training strategy, using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for structural grounding and quality annealing, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for strict geometric alignment. To standardize evaluation on complex layouts, we establish and open-source FPBench-2K. Evaluated on this rigorous benchmark, FloorplanVLM demonstrates exceptional structural validity, achieving $\textbf{92.52%}$ external-wall IoU and robust generalization across non-Manhattan architectures.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on resource constrained wearables requires models that balance accuracy against strict memory and computational budgets. State of the art lightweight architectures such as TinierHAR (34K parameters) and TinyHAR (55K parameters) achieve strong accuracy, but exceed memory budgets of microcontrollers with limited SRAM once operating system overhead is considered. We present MicroBi-ConvLSTM, an ultra-lightweight convolutional-recurrent architecture achieving 11.4K parameters on average through two stage convolutional feature extraction with 4x temporal pooling and a single bidirectional LSTM layer. This represents 2.9x parameter reduction versus TinierHAR and 11.9x versus DeepConvLSTM while preserving linear O(N) complexity. Evaluation across eight diverse HAR benchmarks shows that MicroBi-ConvLSTM maintains competitive performance within the ultra-lightweight regime: 93.41% macro F1 on UCI-HAR, 94.46% on SKODA assembly gestures, and 88.98% on Daphnet gait freeze detection. Systematic ablation reveals task dependent component contributions where bidirectionality benefits episodic event detection, but provides marginal gains on periodic locomotion. INT8 post training quantization incurs only 0.21% average F1-score degradation, yielding a 23.0 KB average deployment footprint suitable for memory constrained edge devices.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection plays a pivotal role in domains such as environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster assessment. However, existing methods typically rely on predefined categories and large-scale pixel-level annotations, which limit their generalization and applicability in open-world scenarios. To address these limitations, this paper proposes AdaptOVCD, a training-free Open-Vocabulary Change Detection (OVCD) architecture based on dual-dimensional multi-level information fusion. The framework integrates multi-level information fusion across data, feature, and decision levels vertically while incorporating targeted adaptive designs horizontally, achieving deep synergy among heterogeneous pre-trained models to effectively mitigate error propagation. Specifically, (1) at the data level, Adaptive Radiometric Alignment (ARA) fuses radiometric statistics with original texture features and synergizes with SAM-HQ to achieve radiometrically consistent segmentation; (2) at the feature level, Adaptive Change Thresholding (ACT) combines global difference distributions with edge structure priors and leverages DINOv3 to achieve robust change detection; (3) at the decision level, Adaptive Confidence Filtering (ACF) integrates semantic confidence with spatial constraints and collaborates with DGTRS-CLIP to achieve high-confidence semantic identification. Comprehensive evaluations across nine scenarios demonstrate that AdaptOVCD detects arbitrary category changes in a zero-shot manner, significantly outperforming existing training-free methods. Meanwhile, it achieves 84.89\% of the fully-supervised performance upper bound in cross-dataset evaluations and exhibits superior generalization capabilities.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-Generated Content (AIGC) technologies poses significant challenges for authenticity assessment. However, existing evaluation protocols largely overlook anti-forensics attack, failing to ensure the comprehensive robustness of state-of-the-art AIGC detectors in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we propose ForgeryEraser, a framework designed to execute universal anti-forensics attack without access to the target AIGC detectors. We reveal an adversarial vulnerability stemming from the systemic reliance on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as shared backbones (e.g., CLIP), where downstream AIGC detectors inherit the feature space of these publicly accessible models. Instead of traditional logit-based optimization, we design a multi-modal guidance loss to drive forged image embeddings within the VLM feature space toward text-derived authentic anchors to erase forgery traces, while repelling them from forgery anchors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ForgeryEraser causes substantial performance degradation to advanced AIGC detectors on both global synthesis and local editing benchmarks. Moreover, ForgeryEraser induces explainable forensic models to generate explanations consistent with authentic images for forged images. Our code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Motion tokenization is a key component of generalizable motion models, yet most existing approaches are restricted to species-specific skeletons, limiting their applicability across diverse morphologies. We propose NECromancer (NEC), a universal motion tokenizer that operates directly on arbitrary BVH skeletons. NEC consists of three components: (1) an Ontology-aware Skeletal Graph Encoder (OwO) that encodes structural priors from BVH files, including joint semantics, rest-pose offsets, and skeletal topology, into skeletal embeddings; (2) a Topology-Agnostic Tokenizer (TAT) that compresses motion sequences into a universal, topology-invariant discrete representation; and (3) the Unified BVH Universe (UvU), a large-scale dataset aggregating BVH motions across heterogeneous skeletons. Experiments show that NEC achieves high-fidelity reconstruction under substantial compression and effectively disentangles motion from skeletal structure. The resulting token space supports cross-species motion transfer, composition, denoising, generation with token-based models, and text-motion retrieval, establishing a unified framework for motion analysis and synthesis across diverse morphologies.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite recent successes, test-time scaling - i.e., dynamically expanding the token budget during inference as needed - remains brittle for vision-language models (VLMs): unstructured chains-of-thought about images entangle perception and reasoning, leading to long, disorganized contexts where small perceptual mistakes may cascade into completely wrong answers. Moreover, expensive reinforcement learning with hand-crafted rewards is required to achieve good performance. Here, we introduce SPARC (Separating Perception And Reasoning Circuits), a modular framework that explicitly decouples visual perception from reasoning. Inspired by sequential sensory-to-cognitive processing in the brain, SPARC implements a two-stage pipeline where the model first performs explicit visual search to localize question-relevant regions, then conditions its reasoning on those regions to produce the final answer. This separation enables independent test-time scaling with asymmetric compute allocation (e.g., prioritizing perceptual processing under distribution shift), supports selective optimization (e.g., improving the perceptual stage alone when it is the bottleneck for end-to-end performance), and accommodates compressed contexts by running global search at lower image resolutions and allocating high-resolution processing only to selected regions, thereby reducing total visual tokens count and compute. Across challenging visual reasoning benchmarks, SPARC outperforms monolithic baselines and strong visual-grounding approaches. For instance, SPARC improves the accuracy of Qwen3VL-4B on the $V^*$ VQA benchmark by 6.7 percentage points, and it surpasses "thinking with images" by 4.6 points on a challenging OOD task despite requiring a 200$\times$ lower token budget.

Abstract: The task of establishing correspondences between two 3D shapes is a long-standing challenge in computer vision. While numerous studies address full-full and partial-full 3D shape matching, only a limited number of works have explored the partial-partial setting, very likely due to its unique challenges: we must compute accurate correspondences while at the same time find the unknown overlapping region. Nevertheless, partial-partial 3D shape matching reflects the most realistic setting, as in many real-world cases, such as 3D scanning, shapes are only partially observable. In this work, we introduce the first integer linear programming approach specifically designed to address the distinctive challenges of partial-partial shape matching. Our method leverages geometric consistency as a strong prior, enabling both robust estimation of the overlapping region and computation of neighbourhood-preserving correspondences. We empirically demonstrate that our approach achieves high-quality matching results both in terms of matching error and smoothness. Moreover, we show that our method is more scalable than previous formalisms.

Abstract: Prototypical parts-based models offer a "this looks like that" paradigm for intrinsic interpretability, yet they typically struggle with ImageNet-scale generalization and often require computationally expensive backbone finetuning. Furthermore, existing methods frequently suffer from "prototype drift," where learned prototypes lack tangible grounding in the training distribution and change their activation under small perturbations. We present ProtoQuant, a novel architecture that achieves prototype stability and grounded interpretability through latent vector quantization. By constraining prototypes to a discrete learned codebook within the latent space, we ensure they remain faithful representations of the training data without the need to update the backbone. This design allows ProtoQuant to function as an efficient, interpretable head that scales to large-scale datasets. We evaluate ProtoQuant on ImageNet and several fine-grained benchmarks (CUB-200, Cars-196). Our results demonstrate that ProtoQuant achieves competitive classification accuracy while generalizing to ImageNet and comparable interpretability metrics to other prototypical-parts-based methods.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become a dominant architecture in computer vision, yet producing stable and high-resolution attribution maps for these models remains challenging. Architectural components such as patch embeddings and attention routing often introduce structured artifacts in pixel-level explanations, causing many existing methods to rely on coarse patch-level attributions.

By exploiting architectural properties of ViTs, DAVE isolates locally equivariant and stable components of the effective input--output mapping.

Our approach integrates a frequency-based augmentation strategy to perturb domain-specific attributes while preserving semantic structures, and a causal suppression loss that mitigates non-causal biases and reinforces causal surgical features. These components are combined in a unified training framework that enables the model to focus on stable causal factors underlying surgical workflows. Experiments on the SurgVisDom hard adaptation benchmark demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms all competing approaches, highlighting the effectiveness of causality-guided vision-language models for domain-generalizable surgical video understanding.

However, their potential in supporting computer-use planning tasks, which are closely related to our lives, remain underexplored. Image generation and editing in computer-use tasks require capabilities like spatial reasoning and procedural understanding, and it is still unknown whether UMMs have these capabilities to finish these tasks or not. Therefore, we propose PlanViz, a new benchmark designed to evaluate image generation and editing for computer-use tasks. To achieve the goal of our evaluation, we focus on sub-tasks which frequently involve in daily life and require planning steps. Specifically, three new sub-tasks are designed: route planning, work diagramming, and web&UI displaying. We address challenges in data quality ensuring by curating human-annotated questions and reference images, and a quality control process. For challenges of comprehensive and exact evaluation, a task-adaptive score, PlanScore, is proposed. The score helps understanding the correctness, visual quality and efficiency of generated images. Through experiments, we highlight key limitations and opportunities for future research on this topic.

Abstract: High-quality annotated datasets are crucial for advancing machine learning in medical image analysis. However, a critical gap exists: most datasets either offer a single, clean ground truth, which hides real-world expert disagreement, or they provide multiple annotations without a separate gold standard for objective evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce CytoCrowd, a new public benchmark for cytology analysis. The dataset features 446 high-resolution images, each with two key components: (1) raw, conflicting annotations from four independent pathologists, and (2) a separate, high-quality gold-standard ground truth established by a senior expert. This dual structure makes CytoCrowd a versatile resource. It serves as a benchmark for standard computer vision tasks, such as object detection and classification, using the ground truth. Simultaneously, it provides a realistic testbed for evaluating annotation aggregation algorithms that must resolve expert disagreements. We provide comprehensive baseline results for both tasks. Our experiments demonstrate the challenges presented by CytoCrowd and establish its value as a resource for developing the next generation of models for medical image analysis.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Fake Image Detection (FID), aiming at unified detection across four image forensic subdomains, is critical in real-world forensic scenarios. Compared with ensemble approaches, monolithic FID models are theoretically more promising, but to date, consistently yield inferior performance in practice. In this work, by discovering the ``heterogeneous phenomenon'', which is the intrinsic distinctness of artifacts across subdomains, we diagnose the cause of this underperformance for the first time: the collapse of the artifact feature space driven by such phenomenon. The core challenge for developing a practical monolithic FID model thus boils down to the ``unified-yet-discriminative" reconstruction of the artifact feature space. To address this paradoxical challenge, we hypothesize that high-level semantics can serve as a structural prior for the reconstruction, and further propose Semantic-Induced Constrained Adaptation (SICA), the first monolithic FID paradigm. Extensive experiments on our OpenMMSec dataset demonstrate that SICA outperforms 15 state-of-the-art methods and reconstructs the target unified-yet-discriminative artifact feature space in a near-orthogonal manner, thus firmly validating our hypothesis. The code and dataset are available at:https: //github.com/scu-zjz/SICA_OpenMMSec.

Abstract: Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a prevalent spinal deformity whose progression can be mitigated through early detection. Conventional screening methods are often subjective, difficult to scale, and reliant on specialized clinical expertise. Video-based gait analysis offers a promising alternative, but current datasets and methods frequently suffer from data leakage, where performance is inflated by repeated clips from the same individual, or employ oversimplified models that lack clinical interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce ScoliGait, a new benchmark dataset comprising 1,572 gait video clips for training and 300 fully independent clips for testing. Each clip is annotated with radiographic Cobb angles and descriptive text based on clinical kinematic priors. We propose a multi-modal framework that integrates a clinical-prior-guided kinematic knowledge map for interpretable feature representation, alongside a latent attention pooling mechanism to fuse video, text, and knowledge map modalities. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art, demonstrating a significant performance gap on a realistic, non-repeating subject benchmark. Our approach establishes a new state of the art, showing a significant performance gain on a realistic, subject-independent benchmark. This work provides a robust, interpretable, and clinically grounded foundation for scalable, non-invasive AIS assessment.

Abstract: Satellite imagery is employed for large-scale prospectivity mapping due to the high cost and typically limited availability of on-site mineral exploration data. In this work, we present a proof-of-concept framework that leverages generative representations learned from multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery to identify gold-bearing regions from space. An autoencoder foundation model, called Isometric, which is pretrained on the large-scale FalconSpace-S2 v1.0 dataset, produces information-dense spectral-spatial representations that serve as inputs to a lightweight XGBoost classifier. We compare this representation-based approach with a raw spectral input baseline using a dataset of 63 Sentinel-2 images from known gold and non-gold locations. The proposed method improves patch-level accuracy from 0.51 to 0.68 and image-level accuracy from 0.55 to 0.73, demonstrating that generative embeddings capture transferable mineralogical patterns even with limited labeled data. These results highlight the potential of foundation-model representations to make mineral exploration more efficient, scalable, and globally applicable.

Abstract: Facial emotion recognition has been typically cast as a single-label classification problem of one out of six prototypical emotions. However, that is an oversimplification that is unsuitable for representing the multifaceted spectrum of spontaneous emotional states, which are most often the result of a combination of multiple emotions contributing at different intensities. Building on this, a promising direction that was explored recently is to cast emotion recognition as a distribution learning problem. Still, such approaches are limited in that research datasets are typically annotated with a single emotion class. In this paper, we contribute a novel approach to describe complex emotional states as probability distributions over a set of emotion classes. To do so, we propose a solution to automatically re-label existing datasets by exploiting the result of a study in which a large set of both basic and compound emotions is mapped to probability distributions in the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) space. In this way, given a face image annotated with VAD values, we can estimate the likelihood of it belonging to each of the distributions, so that emotional states can be described as a mixture of emotions, enriching their description, while also accounting for the ambiguous nature of their perception. In a preliminary set of experiments, we illustrate the advantages of this solution and a new possible direction of investigation.

Abstract: Sweetpotato weevils (Cylas spp.) are considered among the most destructive pests impacting sweetpotato production, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Traditional methods for assessing weevil damage, predominantly relying on manual scoring, are labour-intensive, subjective, and often yield inconsistent results. These challenges significantly hinder breeding programs aimed at developing resilient sweetpotato varieties. This study introduces a computer vision-based approach for the automated evaluation of weevil damage in both field and laboratory contexts. In the field settings, we collected data to train classification models to predict root-damage severity levels, achieving a test accuracy of 71.43%. Additionally, we established a laboratory dataset and designed an object detection pipeline employing YOLO12, a leading real-time detection model. This methodology incorporated a two-stage laboratory pipeline that combined root segmentation with a tiling strategy to improve the detectability of small objects. The resulting model demonstrated a mean average precision of 77.7% in identifying minute weevil feeding holes. Our findings indicate that computer vision technologies can provide efficient, objective, and scalable assessment tools that align seamlessly with contemporary breeding workflows. These advancements represent a significant improvement in enhancing phenotyping efficiency within sweetpotato breeding programs and play a crucial role in mitigating the detrimental effects of weevils on food security.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models achieve impressive generation quality but inherit and amplify training-data biases, skewing coverage of semantic attributes. Prior work addresses this in two ways. Closed-set approaches mitigate biases in predefined fairness categories (e.g., gender, race), assuming socially salient minority attributes are known a priori. Open-set approaches frame the task as bias identification, highlighting majority attributes that dominate outputs. Both overlook a complementary task: uncovering rare or minority features underrepresented in the data distribution (social, cultural, or stylistic) yet still encoded in model representations. We introduce RAIGen, the first framework, to our knowledge, for un-supervised rare-attribute discovery in diffusion models. RAIGen leverages Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders and a novel minority metric combining neuron activation frequency with semantic distinctiveness to identify interpretable neurons whose top-activating images reveal underrepresented attributes. Experiments show RAIGen discovers attributes beyond fixed fairness categories in Stable Diffusion, scales to larger models such as SDXL, supports systematic auditing across architectures, and enables targeted amplification of rare attributes during generation.

Abstract: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting simplification methods commonly use importance scores, such as blending weights or sensitivity, to identify redundant Gaussians. However, these scores are not driven by visual error metrics, often leading to suboptimal trade-offs between compactness and rendering fidelity. We present GaussianPOP, a principled simplification framework based on analytical Gaussian error quantification. Our key contribution is a novel error criterion, derived directly from the 3DGS rendering equation, that precisely measures each Gaussian's contribution to the rendered image. By introducing a highly efficient algorithm, our framework enables practical error calculation in a single forward pass. The framework is both accurate and flexible, supporting on-training pruning as well as post-training simplification via iterative error re-quantification for improved stability. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art pruning methods across both application scenarios, achieving a superior trade-off between model compactness and high rendering quality.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: While modern text-to-image models excel at prompt-based generation, they often lack the fine-grained control necessary for specific user requirements like spatial layouts or subject appearances. Multi-condition control addresses this, yet its integration into Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) is bottlenecked by the conventional ``concatenate-and-attend'' strategy, which suffers from quadratic computational and memory overhead as the number of conditions scales. Our analysis reveals that much of this cross-modal interaction is spatially or semantically redundant. To this end, we propose Position-aligned and Keyword-scoped Attention (PKA), a highly efficient framework designed to eliminate these redundancies. Specifically, Position-Aligned Attention (PAA) linearizes spatial control by enforcing localized patch alignment, while Keyword-Scoped Attention (KSA) prunes irrelevant subject-driven interactions via semantic-aware masking. To facilitate efficient learning, we further introduce a Conditional Sensitivity-Aware Sampling (CSAS) strategy that reweights the training objective towards critical denoising phases, drastically accelerating convergence and enhancing conditional fidelity. Empirically, PKA delivers a 10.0$\times$ inference speedup and a 5.1$\times$ VRAM saving, providing a scalable and resource-friendly solution for high-fidelity multi-conditioned generation.

Abstract: Adapting pre-trained vision models using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) remains challenging, as it aims to achieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning using a minimal number of trainable parameters. When applied to complex dense prediction tasks, existing methods exhibit limitations, including input-agnostic modeling and redundant cross-layer representations. To this end, we propose AdaRoute, a new adapter-style method featuring a simple mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture. Specifically, we introduce shared expert centers, where each expert is a trainable parameter matrix. During a feedforward pass, each AdaRoute module in the network dynamically generates weight matrices tailored for the current module via a simple dynamic parameter routing mechanism, which selectively aggregates parameter matrices in the corresponding expert center. Dynamic weight matrices in AdaRoute modules facilitate low-rank adaptation in an input-dependent manner, thus generating more customized and powerful feature representations. Moreover, since AdaRoute modules across multiple network layers share the same expert center, they improve feature diversity by promoting implicit cross-layer feature interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of AdaRoute on diverse vision tasks, including semantic segmentation, object detection and instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation.

Abstract: Instructional video editing applies edits to an input video using only text prompts, enabling intuitive natural-language control. Despite rapid progress, most methods still require fixed-length inputs and substantial compute. Meanwhile, autoregressive video generation enables efficient variable-length synthesis, yet remains under-explored for video editing. We introduce a causal, efficient video editing model that edits variable-length videos frame by frame. For efficiency, we start from a 2D image-to-image (I2I) diffusion model and adapt it to video-to-video (V2V) editing by conditioning the edit at time step t on the model's prediction at t-1. To leverage videos' temporal redundancy, we propose a new I2I diffusion forward process formulation that encourages the model to predict the residual between the target output and the previous prediction. We call this Residual Flow Diffusion Model (RFDM), which focuses the denoising process on changes between consecutive frames. Moreover, we propose a new benchmark that better ranks state-of-the-art methods for editing tasks. Trained on paired video data for global/local style transfer and object removal, RFDM surpasses I2I-based methods and competes with fully spatiotemporal (3D) V2V models, while matching the compute of image models and scaling independently of input video length.

To address this gap, we introduce NanoFLUX, a 2.4B text-to-image flow-matching model distilled from 17B FLUX.1-Schnell using a progressive compression pipeline designed to preserve generation quality. Our contributions include: (1) A model compression strategy driven by pruning redundant components in the diffusion transformer, reducing its size from 12B to 2B; (2) A ResNet-based token downsampling mechanism that reduces latency by allowing intermediate blocks to operate on lower-resolution tokens while preserving high-resolution processing elsewhere; (3) A novel text encoder distillation approach that leverages visual signals from early layers of the denoiser during sampling. Empirically, NanoFLUX generates 512 x 512 images in approximately 2.5 seconds on mobile devices, demonstrating the feasibility of high-quality on-device text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiTs) for text-to-image generation maintain separate text and image branches, with bidirectional information flow between text tokens and visual latents throughout denoising. In this setting, we observe a prompt forgetting phenomenon: the semantics of the prompt representation in the text branch is progressively forgotten as depth increases. We further verify this effect on three representative MMDiTs--SD3, SD3.5, and FLUX.1 by probing linguistic attributes of the representations over the layers in the text branch. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a training-free approach, prompt reinjection, which reinjects prompt representations from early layers into later layers to alleviate this forgetting. Experiments on GenEval, DPG, and T2I-CompBench++ show consistent gains in instruction-following capability, along with improvements on metrics capturing preference, aesthetics, and overall text--image generation quality.

Abstract: Fully unsupervised segmentation pipelines naively seek the most salient object, should this be present. As a result, most of the methods reported in the literature deliver non-deterministic partitions that are sensitive to initialization, seed order, and threshold heuristics.
  We propose PANC, a weakly supervised spectral segmentation framework that uses a minimal set of annotated visual tokens to produce stable, controllable, and reproducible object masks. From the TokenCut approach, we augment the token-token affinity graph with a handful of priors coupled to anchor nodes. By manipulating the graph topology, we bias the spectral eigenspace toward partitions that are consistent with the annotations. Our approach preserves the global grouping enforced by dense self-supervised visual features, trading annotated tokens for significant gains in reproducibility, user control, and segmentation quality.
  Using 5 to 30 annotations per dataset, our training-free method achieves state-of-the-art performance among weakly and unsupervised approaches on standard benchmarks (e.g., DUTS-TE, ECSSD, MS COCO). Contrarily, it excels in domains where dense labels are costly or intra-class differences are subtle. We report strong and reliable results on homogeneous, fine-grained, and texture-limited domains, achieving 96.8% (+14.43% over SotA), 78.0% (+0.2%), and 78.8% (+0.37%) average mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) on CrackForest (CFD), CUB-200-2011, and HAM10000 datasets, respectively. For multi-object benchmarks, the framework showcases explicit, user-controllable semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Vision capabilities in vision large language models (VLLMs) have consistently lagged behind their linguistic capabilities. In particular, numerous benchmark studies have demonstrated that VLLMs struggle when fine-grained visual information or spatial reasoning is required. However, we do not yet understand exactly why VLLMs struggle so much with these tasks relative to others. Some works have focused on visual redundancy as an explanation, where high-level visual information is uniformly spread across numerous tokens and specific, fine-grained visual information is discarded. In this work, we investigate this premise in greater detail, seeking to better understand exactly how various types of visual information are processed by the model and what types of visual information are discarded. To do so, we introduce a simple synthetic benchmark dataset that is specifically constructed to probe various visual features, along with a set of metrics for measuring visual redundancy, allowing us to better understand the nuances of their relationship. Then, we explore fine-tuning VLLMs on a number of complex visual tasks to better understand how redundancy and compression change based upon the complexity of the data that a model is trained on. We find that there is a connection between task complexity and visual compression, implying that having a sufficient ratio of high complexity visual data is crucial for altering the way that VLLMs distribute their visual representation and consequently improving their performance on complex visual tasks. We hope that this work will provide valuable insights for training the next generation of VLLMs.

Abstract: The classification performance of deep neural networks relies strongly on access to large, accurately annotated datasets. In medical imaging, however, obtaining such datasets is particularly challenging since annotations must be provided by specialized physicians, which severely limits the pool of annotators. Furthermore, class boundaries can often be ambiguous or difficult to define which further complicates machine learning-based classification. In this paper, we want to address this problem and introduce a framework for mislabel detection in medical datasets. This is validated on the two largest, publicly available datasets for Video Capsule Endoscopy, an important imaging procedure for examining the gastrointestinal tract based on a video stream of lowresolution images. In addition, potentially mislabeled samples identified by our pipeline were reviewed and re-annotated by three experienced gastroenterologists. Our results show that the proposed framework successfully detects incorrectly labeled data and results in an improved anomaly detection performance after cleaning the datasets compared to current baselines.

Abstract: Cinematic video production requires control over scene-subject composition and camera movement, but live-action shooting remains costly due to the need for constructing physical sets. To address this, we introduce the task of cinematic video generation with decoupled scene context: given multiple images of a static environment, the goal is to synthesize high-quality videos featuring dynamic subject while preserving the underlying scene consistency and following a user-specified camera trajectory. We present CineScene, a framework that leverages implicit 3D-aware scene representation for cinematic video generation. Our key innovation is a novel context conditioning mechanism that injects 3D-aware features in an implicit way: By encoding scene images into visual representations through VGGT, CineScene injects spatial priors into a pretrained text-to-video generation model by additional context concatenation, enabling camera-controlled video synthesis with consistent scenes and dynamic subjects. To further enhance the model's robustness, we introduce a simple yet effective random-shuffling strategy for the input scene images during training. To address the lack of training data, we construct a scene-decoupled dataset with Unreal Engine 5, containing paired videos of scenes with and without dynamic subjects, panoramic images representing the underlying static scene, along with their camera trajectories. Experiments show that CineScene achieves state-of-the-art performance in scene-consistent cinematic video generation, handling large camera movements and demonstrating generalization across diverse environments.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced, yet their adoption in medicine remains limited by gaps in domain coverage, modality alignment, and grounded reasoning. In this work, we introduce MedMO, a medical foundation model built upon a generalized MLLM architecture and trained exclusively on large-scale, domain-specific data. MedMO follows a multi-stage training recipe: (i) cross-modal pretraining to align heterogeneous visual encoders with a medical language backbone; (ii) instruction tuning on multi-task supervision that spans captioning, VQA, report generation, retrieval, and grounded disease localization with bounding boxes; and (iii) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards that combine factuality checks with a box-level GIoU reward to strengthen spatial grounding and step-by-step reasoning in complex clinical scenarios. MedMO consistently outperforms strong open-source medical MLLMs across multiple modalities and tasks. On VQA benchmarks, MedMO achieves an average accuracy improvement of +13.7% over the baseline and performs within 1.9% of the SOTA Fleming-VL. For text-based QA, it attains +6.9% over the baseline and +14.5% over Fleming-VL. In medical report generation, MedMO delivers significant gains in both semantic and clinical accuracy. Moreover, it exhibits strong grounding capability, achieving an IoU improvement of +40.4 over the baseline and +37.0% over Fleming-VL, underscoring its robust spatial reasoning and localization performance. Evaluations across radiology, ophthalmology, and pathology-microscopy confirm MedMO's broad cross-modality generalization. We release two versions of MedMO: 4B and 8B.

Abstract: Slogans are concise and memorable catchphrases that play a crucial role in advertising by conveying brand identity and shaping public perception. However, advertising fatigue reduces the effectiveness of repeated slogans, creating a growing demand for novel, creative, and insightful slogan generation. While recent work leverages large language models (LLMs) for this task, existing approaches often produce stylistically redundant outputs that lack a clear brand persona and appear overtly machine-generated. We argue that effective slogans should balance novelty with familiarity and propose a new paradigm that recontextualizes persona-related famous quotes for slogan generation. Well-known quotes naturally align with slogan-length text, employ rich rhetorical devices, and offer depth and insight, making them a powerful resource for creative generation. Technically, we introduce a modular framework that decomposes slogan generation into interpretable subtasks, including quote matching, structural decomposition, vocabulary replacement, and remix generation. Extensive automatic and human evaluations demonstrate marginal improvements in diversity, novelty, emotional impact, and human preference over three state-of-the-art LLM baselines.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable capabilities of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), they still lack detailed knowledge about specific entities. Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) is a widely adopted solution that enhances LVLMs by providing additional contexts from an external Knowledge Base. However, we observe that previous decoding methods for RAG are sub-optimal as they fail to sufficiently leverage multiple relevant contexts and suppress the negative effects of irrelevant contexts. To this end, we propose Relevance-aware Multi-context Contrastive Decoding (RMCD), a novel decoding method for RAG. RMCD outputs a final prediction by combining outputs predicted with each context, where each output is weighted based on its relevance to the question. By doing so, RMCD effectively aggregates useful information from multiple relevant contexts while also counteracting the negative effects of irrelevant ones. Experiments show that RMCD consistently outperforms other decoding methods across multiple LVLMs, achieving the best performance on three knowledge-intensive visual question-answering benchmarks. Also, RMCD can be simply applied by replacing the decoding method of LVLMs without additional training. Analyses also show that RMCD is robust to the retrieval results, consistently performing the best across the weakest to the strongest retrieval results. Code is available at https://github.com/mlvlab/RMCD.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Episodic memory is a central component of human memory, which refers to the ability to recall coherent events grounded in who, when, and where. However, most agent memory systems only emphasize semantic recall and treat experience as structures such as key-value, vector, or graph, which makes them struggle to represent and retrieve coherent events. To address this challenge, we propose a Character-and-Scene based memory architecture(CAST) inspired by dramatic theory. Specifically, CAST constructs 3D scenes (time/place/topic) and organizes them into character profiles that summarize the events of a character to represent episodic memory. Moreover, CAST complements this episodic memory with a graph-based semantic memory, which yields a robust dual memory design. Experiments demonstrate that CAST has averagely improved 8.11% F1 and 10.21% J(LLM-as-a-Judge) than baselines on various datasets, especially on open and time-sensitive conversational questions.

Abstract: The research of artificial intelligence is undergoing a paradigm shift from prioritizing model innovations over benchmark scores towards emphasizing problem definition and rigorous real-world evaluation. As the field enters the "second half," the central challenge becomes real utility in long-horizon, dynamic, and user-dependent environments, where agents face context explosion and must continuously accumulate, manage, and selectively reuse large volumes of information across extended interactions. Memory, with hundreds of papers released this year, therefore emerges as the critical solution to fill the utility gap. In this survey, we provide a unified view of foundation agent memory along three dimensions: memory substrate (internal and external), cognitive mechanism (episodic, semantic, sensory, working, and procedural), and memory subject (agent- and user-centric). We then analyze how memory is instantiated and operated under different agent topologies and highlight learning policies over memory operations. Finally, we review evaluation benchmarks and metrics for assessing memory utility, and outline various open challenges and future directions.

Abstract: Recent advances in duplex speech models have enabled natural, low-latency speech-to-speech interactions. However, existing models are restricted to a fixed role and voice, limiting their ability to support structured, role-driven real-world applications and personalized interactions. In this work, we introduce PersonaPlex, a duplex conversational speech model that incorporates hybrid system prompts, combining role conditioning with text prompts and voice cloning with speech samples. PersonaPlex is trained on a large-scale synthetic dataset of paired prompts and user-agent conversations, generated with open-source large language models (LLM) and text-to-speech (TTS) models. To evaluate role conditioning in real-world settings, we extend the Full-Duplex-Bench benchmark beyond a single assistant role to multi-role customer service scenarios. Experiments show that PersonaPlex achieves strong role-conditioned behavior, voice-conditioned speech, and natural conversational responsiveness, surpassing state-of-the-art duplex speech models and hybrid large language model-based speech systems in role adherence, speaker similarity, latency, and naturalness.

Abstract: Assessing research novelty is a core yet highly subjective aspect of peer review, typically based on implicit judgment and incomplete comparison to prior work. We introduce a literature-aware novelty assessment framework that explicitly learns how humans judge novelty from peer-review reports and grounds these judgments in structured comparison to existing research. Using nearly 80K novelty-annotated reviews from top-tier AI conferences, we fine-tune a large language model to capture reviewer-aligned novelty evaluation behavior. For a given manuscript, the system extracts structured representations of its ideas, methods, and claims, retrieves semantically related papers, and constructs a similarity graph that enables fine-grained, concept-level comparison to prior work. Conditioning on this structured evidence, the model produces calibrated novelty scores and human-like explanatory assessments, reducing overestimation and improving consistency relative to existing approaches.

Abstract: Current annotation agreement metrics are not well-suited for inter-group analysis, are sensitive to group size imbalances and restricted to single-annotation settings. These restrictions render them insufficient for many subjective tasks such as toxicity and hate-speech detection. For this reason, we introduce a quantifiable metric, paired with a statistical significance test, that attributes polarization to various annotator groups. Our metric enables direct comparisons between heavily imbalanced sociodemographic and ideological subgroups across different datasets and tasks, while also enabling analysis on multi-label settings. We apply this metric to three datasets on hate speech, and one on toxicity detection, discovering that: (1) Polarization is strongly and persistently attributed to annotator race, especially on the hate speech task. (2) Religious annotators do not fundamentally disagree with each other, but do with other annotators, a trend that is gradually diminished and then reversed with irreligious annotators. (3) Less educated annotators are more subjective, while educated ones tend to broadly agree more between themselves. Overall, our results reflect current findings around annotation patterns for various subgroups. Finally, we estimate the minimum number of annotators needed to obtain robust results, and provide an open-source Python library that implements our metric.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Parallel diffusion decoding can accelerate diffusion language model inference by unmasking multiple tokens per step, but aggressive parallelism often harms quality. Revocable decoding mitigates this by rechecking earlier tokens, yet we observe that existing verification schemes frequently trigger flip-flop oscillations, where tokens are remasked and later restored unchanged. This behaviour slows inference in two ways: remasking verified positions weakens the conditioning context for parallel drafting, and repeated remask cycles consume the revision budget with little net progress. We propose COVER (Cache Override Verification for Efficient Revision), which performs leave-one-out verification and stable drafting within a single forward pass. COVER constructs two attention views via KV cache override: selected seeds are masked for verification, while their cached key value states are injected for all other queries to preserve contextual information, with a closed form diagonal correction preventing self leakage at the seed positions. COVER further prioritises seeds using a stability aware score that balances uncertainty, downstream influence, and cache drift, and it adapts the number of verified seeds per step. Across benchmarks, COVER markedly reduces unnecessary revisions and yields faster decoding while preserving output quality.

Abstract: Post-training quantization reduces the computational cost of large language models but fundamentally alters their social biases in ways that aggregate metrics fail to capture. We present the first large-scale study of 50 quantized models evaluated on PostTrainingBiasBench, a unified benchmark of 13 closed- and open-ended bias datasets. We identify a phenomenon we term quantization-induced masked bias flipping, in which up to 21% of responses flip between biased and unbiased states after quantization, despite showing no change in aggregate bias scores. These flips are strongly driven by model uncertainty, where the responses with high uncertainty are 3-11x more likely to change than the confident ones. Quantization strength amplifies this effect, with 4-bit quantized models exhibiting 4-6x more behavioral changes than 8-bit quantized models. Critically, these changes create asymmetric impacts across demographic groups, where bias can worsen by up to 18.6% for some groups while improving by 14.1% for others, yielding misleadingly neutral aggregate outcomes. Larger models show no consistent robustness advantage, and group-specific shifts vary unpredictably across model families. Our findings demonstrate that compression fundamentally alters bias patterns, requiring crucial post-quantization evaluation and interventions to ensure reliability in practice.

We present BenchMarker, an education-inspired toolkit using LLM judges to flag three common MCQ flaws: 1) contamination - items appearing exactly online; 2) shortcuts - cues in the choices that enable guessing; and 3) writing errors - structural/grammatical issues based on a 19-rule education rubric. We validate BenchMarker with human annotations, then run the tool to audit 12 benchmarks, revealing: 2) contaminated MCQs tend to inflate accuracy, while writing errors tend to lower it and change rankings beyond random; and 3) prior benchmark repairs address their targeted issues (i.e., lowering accuracy with LLM-written distractors), but inadvertently add new flaws (i.e. implausible distractors, many correct answers). Overall, flaws in MCQs degrade NLP evaluation, but education research offers a path forward. We release BenchMarker to bridge the fields and improve MCQA benchmark design.

Abstract: Polemic questions need more than one viewpoint to express a balanced answer. Large Language Models (LLMs) can provide a balanced answer, but also take a single aligned viewpoint or refuse to answer. In this paper, we study if such initial responses can be steered to a specific viewpoint in a simple and intuitive way: by only providing one-sided arguments supporting the viewpoint. Our systematic study has three dimensions: (i) which stance is induced in the LLM response, (ii) how the polemic question is formulated, (iii) how the arguments are shown. We construct a small dataset and remarkably find that opinion steering occurs across (i)-(iii) for diverse models, number of arguments, and topics. Switching to other arguments consistently decreases opinion steering.

Abstract: Test-time compute is central to large reasoning models, yet analysing their reasoning behaviour through generated text is increasingly impractical and unreliable. Response length is often used as a brute proxy for reasoning effort, but this metric fails to capture the dynamics and effectiveness of the Chain of Thoughts (CoT) or the generated tokens. We propose Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) as a non-textual alternative for analysing model's reasoning chains at test time. By treating token generation as a dynamical system, we extract hidden embeddings at each generation step and apply RQA to the resulting trajectories. RQA metrics, including Determinism and Laminarity, quantify patterns of repetition and stalling in the model's latent representations. Analysing 3,600 generation traces from DeepSeek-R1-Distill, we show that RQA captures signals not reflected by response length, but also substantially improves prediction of task complexity by 8\%. These results help establish RQA as a principled tool for studying the latent token generation dynamics of test-time scaling in reasoning models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly integrated into clinical workflows; however, prompt injection attacks can steer these systems toward clinically unsafe or misleading outputs. We introduce the Medical Prompt Injection Benchmark (MPIB), a dataset-and-benchmark suite for evaluating clinical safety under both direct prompt injection and indirect, RAG-mediated injection across clinically grounded tasks. MPIB emphasizes outcome-level risk via the Clinical Harm Event Rate (CHER), which measures high-severity clinical harm events under a clinically grounded taxonomy, and reports CHER alongside Attack Success Rate (ASR) to disentangle instruction compliance from downstream patient risk. The benchmark comprises 9,697 curated instances constructed through multi-stage quality gates and clinical safety linting. Evaluating MPIB across a diverse set of baseline LLMs and defense configurations, we find that ASR and CHER can diverge substantially, and that robustness depends critically on whether adversarial instructions appear in the user query or in retrieved context. We release MPIB with evaluation code, adversarial baselines, and comprehensive documentation to support reproducible and systematic research on clinical prompt injection. Code and data are available at GitHub (code) and Hugging Face (data).

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Emotion recognition in speech presents a complex multimodal challenge, requiring comprehension of both linguistic content and vocal expressivity, particularly prosodic features such as fundamental frequency, intensity, and temporal dynamics. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in reasoning over textual transcriptions for emotion recognition, they typically neglect fine-grained prosodic information, limiting their effectiveness and interpretability. In this work, we propose VowelPrompt, a linguistically grounded framework that augments LLM-based emotion recognition with interpretable, fine-grained vowel-level prosodic cues. Drawing on phonetic evidence that vowels serve as primary carriers of affective prosody, VowelPrompt extracts pitch-, energy-, and duration-based descriptors from time-aligned vowel segments, and converts these features into natural language descriptions for better interpretability. Such a design enables LLMs to jointly reason over lexical semantics and fine-grained prosodic variation. Moreover, we adopt a two-stage adaptation procedure comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR), implemented via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to enhance reasoning capability, enforce structured output adherence, and improve generalization across domains and speaker variations. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that VowelPrompt consistently outperforms state-of-the-art emotion recognition methods under zero-shot, fine-tuned, cross-domain, and cross-linguistic conditions, while enabling the generation of interpretable explanations that are jointly grounded in contextual semantics and fine-grained prosodic structure.

Abstract: Explaining closed-source LLM outputs is challenging because API access prevents gradient-based attribution, while perturbation methods are costly and noisy when they depend on regenerated text. We introduce RoPE-LIME, an open-source extension of gSMILE that decouples reasoning from explanation: given a fixed output from a closed model, a smaller open-source surrogate computes token-level attributions from probability-based objectives (negative log-likelihood and divergence targets) under input perturbations. RoPE-LIME incorporates (i) a locality kernel based on Relaxed Word Mover's Distance computed in RoPE embedding space for stable similarity under masking, and (ii) Sparse-K sampling, an efficient perturbation strategy that improves interaction coverage under limited budgets. Experiments on HotpotQA (sentence features) and a hand-labeled MMLU subset (word features) show that RoPE-LIME produces more informative attributions than leave-one-out sampling and improves over gSMILE while substantially reducing closed-model API calls.

Abstract: Recent progress in reasoning models suggests that generating plausible attempts for research-level mathematics may be within reach, but verification remains a bottleneck, consuming scarce expert time. We hypothesize that a meaningful solution should contain enough method-level information that, when applied to a neighborhood of related questions, it should yield better downstream performance than incorrect solutions. Building on this idea, we propose \textbf{Consequence-Based Utility}, an oracle-free evaluator that scores each candidate by testing its value as an in-context exemplar in solving related yet verifiable questions. Our approach is evaluated on an original set of research-level math problems, each paired with one expert-written solution and nine LLM-generated solutions. Notably, Consequence-Based Utility consistently outperforms reward models, generative reward models, and LLM judges on ranking quality. Specifically, for GPT-OSS-120B, it improves Acc@1 from 67.2 to 76.3 and AUC from 71.4 to 79.6, with similarly large AUC gains on GPT-OSS-20B (69.0 to 79.2). Furthermore, compared to LLM-Judges, it also exhibits a larger solver-evaluator gap, maintaining a stronger correct-wrong separation even on instances where the underlying solver often fails to solve.

Abstract: Spoken code-switching (CSW) challenges syntactic parsing in ways not observed in written text. Disfluencies, repetition, ellipsis, and discourse-driven structure routinely violate standard Universal Dependencies (UD) assumptions, causing parsers and large language models (LLMs) to fail despite strong performance on written data. These failures are compounded by rigid evaluation metrics that conflate genuine structural errors with acceptable variation. In this work, we present a systems-oriented approach to spoken CSW parsing. We introduce a linguistically grounded taxonomy of spoken CSW phenomena and SpokeBench, an expert-annotated gold benchmark designed to test spoken-language structure beyond standard UD assumptions. We further propose FLEX-UD, an ambiguity-aware evaluation metric, which reveals that existing parsing techniques perform poorly on spoken CSW by penalizing linguistically plausible analyses as errors. We then propose DECAP, a decoupled agentic parsing framework that isolates spoken-phenomena handling from core syntactic analysis. Experiments show that DECAP produces more robust and interpretable parses without retraining and achieves up to 52.6% improvements over existing parsing techniques. FLEX-UD evaluations further reveal qualitative improvements that are masked by standard metrics.

Abstract: Causal inference is essential for decision-making but remains challenging for non-experts. While large language models (LLMs) show promise in this domain, their precise causal estimation capabilities are still limited, and the impact of post-training on these abilities is insufficiently explored. This paper examines the extent to which post-training can enhance LLMs' capacity for causal inference. We introduce CauGym, a comprehensive dataset comprising seven core causal tasks for training and five diverse test sets. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate five post-training approaches: SFT, DPO, KTO, PPO, and GRPO. Across five in-domain and four existing benchmarks, our experiments demonstrate that appropriate post-training enables smaller LLMs to perform causal inference competitively, often surpassing much larger models. Our 14B parameter model achieves 93.5% accuracy on the CaLM benchmark, compared to 55.4% by OpenAI o3. Furthermore, the post-trained LLMs exhibit strong generalization and robustness under real-world conditions such as distribution shifts and noisy data. Collectively, these findings provide the first systematic evidence that targeted post-training can produce reliable and robust LLM-based causal reasoners. Our data and GRPO-model are available at https://github.com/OpenCausaLab/CauGym.

Abstract: We propose SHINE (Scalable Hyper In-context NEtwork), a scalable hypernetwork that can map diverse meaningful contexts into high-quality LoRA adapters for large language models (LLM). By reusing the frozen LLM's own parameters in an in-context hypernetwork design and introducing architectural innovations, SHINE overcomes key limitations of prior hypernetworks and achieves strong expressive power with a relatively small number of parameters. We introduce a pretraining and instruction fine-tuning pipeline, and train our hypernetwork to generate high quality LoRA adapters from diverse meaningful contexts in a single forward pass. It updates LLM parameters without any fine-tuning, and immediately enables complex question answering tasks related to the context without directly accessing the context, effectively transforming in-context knowledge to in-parameter knowledge in one pass. Our work achieves outstanding results on various tasks, greatly saves time, computation and memory costs compared to SFT-based LLM adaptation, and shows great potential for scaling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 4.5 have demonstrated strong capabilities in open-ended reasoning and generative language tasks, leading to their widespread adoption across a broad range of NLP applications. However, for structured text classification problems with fixed label spaces, model selection is often driven by predictive performance alone, overlooking operational constraints encountered in production systems.
  In this work, we present a systematic comparison of two contrasting paradigms for text classification: zero- and few-shot prompt-based large language models, and fully fine-tuned encoder-only architectures. We evaluate these approaches across four canonical benchmarks (IMDB, SST-2, AG News, and DBPedia), measuring predictive quality (macro F1), inference latency, and monetary cost.
  We frame model evaluation as a multi-objective decision problem and analyze trade-offs using Pareto frontier projections and a parameterized utility function reflecting different deployment regimes. Our results show that fine-tuned encoder-based models from the BERT family achieve competitive, and often superior, classification performance while operating at one to two orders of magnitude lower cost and latency compared to zero- and few-shot LLM prompting.
  Overall, our findings suggest that indiscriminate use of large language models for standard text classification workloads can lead to suboptimal system-level outcomes. Instead, fine-tuned encoders emerge as robust and efficient components for structured NLP pipelines, while LLMs are better positioned as complementary elements within hybrid architectures. We release all code, datasets, and evaluation protocols to support reproducibility and cost-aware NLP system design.

Abstract: While self-reflection can enhance language model reliability, its underlying mechanisms remain opaque, with existing analyses often yielding correlation-based insights that fail to generalize. To address this, we introduce \textbf{\texttt{ReBeCA}} (self-\textbf{\texttt{Re}}flection \textbf{\texttt{Be}}havior explained through \textbf{\texttt{C}}ausal \textbf{\texttt{A}}nalysis), a framework that unveils the interpretable behavioral hierarchy governing the self-reflection outcome. By modeling self-reflection trajectories as causal graphs, ReBeCA isolates genuine determinants of performance through a three-stage Invariant Causal Prediction (ICP) pipeline. We establish three critical findings: (1) \textbf{Behavioral hierarchy:} Semantic behaviors of the model influence final self-reflection results hierarchically: directly or indirectly; (2) \textbf{Causation matters:} Generalizability in self-reflection effects is limited to just a few semantic behaviors; (3) \textbf{More $\mathbf{\neq}$ better:} The confluence of seemingly positive semantic behaviors, even among direct causal factors, can impair the efficacy of self-reflection. ICP-based verification identifies sparse causal parents achieving up to $49.6\%$ structural likelihood gains, stable across tasks where correlation-based patterns fail. Intervention studies on novel datasets confirm these causal relationships hold out-of-distribution ($p = .013, η^2_\mathrm{p} = .071$). ReBeCA thus provides a rigorous methodology for disentangling genuine causal mechanisms from spurious associations in self-reflection dynamics.

Abstract: Producing outputs that satisfy both semantic intent and format constraints is essential for deploying large language models in user-facing and system-integrated workflows. In this work, we focus on Markdown formatting, which is ubiquitous in assistants, documentation, and tool-augmented pipelines but still prone to subtle, hard-to-detect errors (e.g., broken lists, malformed tables, inconsistent headings, and invalid code blocks) that can significantly degrade downstream usability. We present FMBench, a benchmark for adaptive Markdown output formatting that evaluates models under a wide range of instruction-following scenarios with diverse structural requirements. FMBench emphasizes real-world formatting behaviors such as multi-level organization, mixed content (natural language interleaved with lists/tables/code), and strict adherence to user-specified layout constraints. To improve Markdown compliance without relying on hard decoding constraints, we propose a lightweight alignment pipeline that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning fine-tuning. Starting from a base model, we first perform SFT on instruction-response pairs, and then optimize a composite objective that balances semantic fidelity with structural correctness. Experiments on two model families (OpenPangu and Qwen) show that SFT consistently improves semantic alignment, while reinforcement learning provides additional gains in robustness to challenging Markdown instructions when initialized from a strong SFT policy.

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models generate sequences via iterative sampling that progressively unmasks tokens. However, they still recompute the attention and feed-forward blocks for every token position at every step -- even when many unmasked tokens are essentially fixed, resulting in substantial waste in compute. We propose SureLock: when the posterior at an unmasked position has stabilized across steps (our sure condition), we lock that position -- thereafter skipping its query projection and feed-forward sublayers -- while caching its attention keys and values so other positions can continue to attend to it. This reduces the dominant per-iteration computational cost from $O(N^2d)$ to $O(MNd)$ where $N$ is the sequence length, $M$ is the number of unlocked token positions, and $d$ is the model dimension. In practice, $M$ decreases as the iteration progresses, yielding substantial savings. On LLaDA-8B, SureLock reduces algorithmic FLOPs by 30--50% relative to the same sampler without locking, while maintaining comparable generation quality. We also provide a theoretical analysis to justify the design rationale of SureLock: monitoring only the local KL at the lock step suffices to bound the deviation in final token probabilities. Our code will be available at https://daioba.github.io/surelock .

Abstract: Humor is a commonly used and intricate human language in daily life. Humor generation, especially in multi-modal scenarios, is a challenging task for large language models (LLMs), which is typically as funny caption generation for images, requiring visual understanding, humor reasoning, creative imagination, and so on. Existing LLM-based approaches rely on reasoning chains or self-improvement, which suffer from limited creativity and interpretability. To address these bottlenecks, we develop a novel LLM-based humor generation mechanism based on a fundamental humor theory, GTVH. To produce funny and script-opposite captions, we introduce a humor-theory-driven multi-role LLM collaboration framework augmented with humor retrieval (HOMER). The framework consists of three LLM-based roles: (1) conflicting-script extractor that grounds humor in key script oppositions, forming the basis of caption generation; (2) retrieval-augmented hierarchical imaginator that identifies key humor targets and expands the creative space of them through diverse associations structured as imagination trees; and (3) caption generator that produces funny and diverse captions conditioned on the obtained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two New Yorker Cartoon benchmarking datasets show that HOMER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and powerful LLM reasoning strategies on multi-modal humor captioning.

Abstract: In the field of natural language processing, some studies have attempted sentiment analysis on text by handling emotions as explanatory or response variables. One of the most popular emotion models used in this context is the wheel of emotion proposed by Plutchik. This model schematizes human emotions in a circular structure, and represents them in two or three dimensions. However, the validity of Plutchik's wheel of emotion has not been sufficiently examined. This study investigated the validity of the wheel by creating and analyzing a semantic networks of emotion words. Through our experiments, we collected data of similarity and association of ordered pairs of emotion words, and constructed networks using these data. We then analyzed the structure of the networks through community detection, and compared it with that of the wheel of emotion. The results showed that each network's structure was, for the most part, similar to that of the wheel of emotion, but locally different.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to many domains, making their safety a critical priority. Prior jailbreaking research has explored diverse approaches, including prompt optimization, automated red teaming, obfuscation, and reinforcement learning (RL) based methods. However, most existing techniques fail to effectively leverage vulnerabilities revealed in earlier interaction turns, resulting in inefficient and unstable attacks. Since jailbreaking involves sequential interactions in which each response influences future actions, reinforcement learning provides a natural framework for this problem. Motivated by this, we propose a history-aware RL-based jailbreak framework that analyzes and reweights vulnerability signals from prior steps to guide future decisions. We show that incorporating historical information alone improves jailbreak success rates. Building on this insight, we introduce an attention-based reweighting mechanism that highlights critical vulnerabilities within the interaction history, enabling more efficient exploration with fewer queries. Extensive experiments on AdvBench and HarmBench demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art jailbreak performance while significantly improving query efficiency. These results underscore the importance of historical vulnerability signals in reinforcement learning-driven jailbreak strategies and offer a principled pathway for advancing adversarial research on LLM safeguards.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well on many reasoning benchmarks, yet existing evaluations rarely assess their ability to distinguish between meaningful semantic relations and genuine unrelatedness. We introduce CORE (Comprehensive Ontological Relation Evaluation), a dataset of 225K multiple-choice questions spanning 74 disciplines, together with a general-domain open-source benchmark of 203 rigorously validated questions (Cohen's Kappa = 1.0) covering 24 semantic relation types with equal representation of unrelated pairs. A human baseline from 1,000+ participants achieves 92.6% accuracy (95.1% on unrelated pairs). In contrast, 29 state-of-the-art LLMs achieve 48.25-70.9% overall accuracy, with near-ceiling performance on related pairs (86.5-100%) but severe degradation on unrelated pairs (0-41.35%), despite assigning similar confidence (92-94%). Expected Calibration Error increases 2-4x on unrelated pairs, and a mean semantic collapse rate of 37.6% indicates systematic generation of spurious relations. On the CORE 225K MCQs dataset, accuracy further drops to approximately 2%, highlighting substantial challenges in domain-specific semantic reasoning. We identify unrelatedness reasoning as a critical, under-evaluated frontier for LLM evaluation and safety.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold transformative potential for medical decision support yet their application in psychiatry remains constrained by hallucinations and superficial reasoning. This limitation is particularly acute in light-parameter LLMs which are essential for privacy-preserving and efficient clinical deployment. Existing training paradigms prioritize linguistic fluency over structured clinical logic and result in a fundamental misalignment with professional diagnostic cognition. Here we introduce ClinMPO, a reinforcement learning framework designed to align the internal reasoning of LLMs with professional psychiatric practice. The framework employs a specialized reward model trained independently on a dataset derived from 4,474 psychiatry journal articles and structured according to evidence-based medicine principles. We evaluated ClinMPO on a unseen subset of the benchmark designed to isolate reasoning capabilities from rote memorization. This test set comprises items where leading large-parameter LLMs consistently fail. We compared the ClinMPO-aligned light LLM performance against a cohort of 300 medical students. The ClinMPO-tuned Qwen3-8B model achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 31.4% and surpassed the human benchmark of 30.8% on these complex cases. These results demonstrate that medical evidence-guided optimization enables light-parameter LLMs to master complex reasoning tasks. Our findings suggest that explicit cognitive alignment offers a scalable pathway to reliable and safe psychiatric decision support.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on complex reasoning tasks by generating long, multi-step reasoning trajectories, but inference-time scaling incurs substantial deployment cost. A key challenge is that generation difficulty varies within a single output, whereas existing efficiency-oriented approaches either ignore this intra-generation variation or rely on supervised token-level routing with high system complexity. We present \textbf{RelayGen}, a training-free, segment-level runtime model switching framework that exploits difficulty variation in long-form reasoning. Through offline analysis of generation uncertainty using token probability margins, we show that coarse-grained segment-level control is sufficient to capture difficulty transitions within a reasoning trajectory. RelayGen identifies model-specific switch cues that signal transitions to lower-difficulty segments and dynamically delegates their continuation to a smaller model, while preserving high-difficulty reasoning on the large model. Across multiple reasoning benchmarks, RelayGen substantially reduces inference latency while preserving most of the accuracy of large models. When combined with speculative decoding, RelayGen achieves up to 2.2$\times$ end-to-end speedup with less than 2\% accuracy degradation, without requiring additional training or learned routing components.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models generate by iteratively filling masked tokens over multiple denoising steps, so learning only from a terminal reward on the final completion yields coarse credit assignment over intermediate decisions. We propose DiSPO (Diffusion-State Policy Optimization), a plug-in credit-assignment layer that directly optimizes intermediate filling decisions. At selected intermediate masked states, DiSPO branches by resampling fillings for the currently masked positions from rollout-cached logits, scores the resulting completions, and updates only the newly filled tokens -- without additional multi-step diffusion rollouts. We formalize a fixed-state objective for branched completions and derive a policy-gradient estimator that can be combined with terminal-feedback policy optimization using the same rollouts. On LLaDA-8B-Instruct, DiSPO consistently improves over the terminal-feedback diffu-GRPO baseline on math and planning benchmarks under matched rollout compute and optimizer steps. Our code will be available at https://daioba.github.io/dispo .

Abstract: Scaling training data and model parameters has long driven progress in large language models (LLMs), but this paradigm is increasingly constrained by the scarcity of high-quality data and diminishing returns from rising computational costs. As a result, recent work is increasing the focus on continual learning from real-world deployment, where user interaction logs provide a rich source of authentic human feedback and procedural knowledge. However, learning from user logs is challenging due to their unstructured and noisy nature. Vanilla LLM systems often struggle to distinguish useful feedback signals from noisy user behavior, and the disparity between user log collection and model optimization (e.g., the off-policy optimization problem) further strengthens the problem. To this end, we propose UNO (User log-driveN Optimization), a unified framework for improving LLM systems (LLMsys) with user logs. UNO first distills logs into semi-structured rules and preference pairs, then employs query-and-feedback-driven clustering to manage data heterogeneity, and finally quantifies the cognitive gap between the model's prior knowledge and the log data. This assessment guides the LLMsys to adaptively filter out noisy feedback and construct different modules for primary and reflective experiences extracted from user logs, thereby improving future responses. Extensive experiments show that UNO achieves state-of-the-art effectiveness and efficiency, significantly outperforming Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and memory-based baselines. We have open-sourced our code at https://github.com/bebr2/UNO .

Abstract: Dense Transformer language models have largely adhered to one consistent architectural shape: each layer consists of an attention module followed by a feed-forward network (FFN) with a narrow-wide-narrow MLP, allocating most parameters to the MLP at expansion ratios between 2 and 4. Motivated by recent results that residual wide-narrow-wide (hourglass) MLPs offer superior function approximation capabilities, we revisit the long-standing MLP shape convention in Transformer, challenging the necessity of the narrow-wide-narrow design. To study this, we develop a Transformer variant that replaces the conventional FFN with a deeper hourglass-shaped FFN, comprising a stack of hourglass sub-MLPs connected by residual pathways. We posit that a deeper but lighter hourglass FFN can serve as a competitive alternative to the conventional FFN, and that parameters saved by using a lighter hourglass FFN can be more effectively utilized, such as by enlarging model hidden dimensions under fixed budgets. We confirm these through empirical validations across model scales: hourglass FFNs outperform conventional FFNs up to 400M and achieve comparable performance at larger scales to 1B parameters; hourglass FFN variants with reduced FFN and increased attention parameters show consistent improvements over conventional configurations at matched budgets. Together, these findings shed new light on recent work and prompt a rethinking of the narrow-wide-narrow MLP convention and the balance between attention and FFN towards efficient and expressive modern language models.

Abstract: Information retrieval (IR) evaluation remains challenging due to incomplete IR benchmark datasets that contain unlabeled relevant chunks. While LLMs and LLM-human hybrid strategies reduce costly human effort, they remain prone to LLM overconfidence and ineffective AI-to-human escalation. To address this, we propose DREAM, a multi-round debate-based relevance assessment framework with LLM agents, built on opposing initial stances and iterative reciprocal critique. Through our agreement-based debate, it yields more accurate labeling for certain cases and more reliable AI-to-human escalation for uncertain ones, achieving 95.2% labeling accuracy with only 3.5% human involvement. Using DREAM, we build BRIDGE, a refined benchmark that mitigates evaluation bias and enables fairer retriever comparison by uncovering 29,824 missing relevant chunks. We then re-benchmark IR systems and extend evaluation to RAG, showing that unaddressed holes not only distort retriever rankings but also drive retrieval-generation misalignment. The relevance assessment framework is available at https: //github.com/DISL-Lab/DREAM-ICLR-26; and the BRIDGE dataset is available at https://github.com/DISL-Lab/BRIDGE-Benchmark.

Abstract: Standard chain-of-thought reasoning generates a solution in a single forward pass, committing irrevocably to each token and lacking a mechanism to recover from early errors. We introduce Inference-Time Rethinking, a generative framework that enables iterative self-correction by decoupling declarative latent thought vectors from procedural generation. We factorize reasoning into a continuous latent thought vector (what to reason about) and a decoder that verbalizes the trace conditioned on this vector (how to reason). Beyond serving as a declarative buffer, latent thought vectors compress the reasoning structure into a continuous representation that abstracts away surface-level token variability, making gradient-based optimization over reasoning strategies well-posed. Our prior model maps unstructured noise to a learned manifold of valid reasoning patterns, and at test time we employ a Gibbs-style procedure that alternates between generating a candidate trace and optimizing the latent vector to better explain that trace, effectively navigating the latent manifold to refine the reasoning strategy. Training a 0.2B-parameter model from scratch on GSM8K, our method with 30 rethinking iterations surpasses baselines with 10 to 15 times more parameters, including a 3B counterpart. This result demonstrates that effective mathematical reasoning can emerge from sophisticated inference-time computation rather than solely from massive parameter counts.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Test-time compute allocation in large reasoning models (LRMs) is widely used and has applications in mathematical problem solving, code synthesis, and planning. Recent work has addressed this problem by scaling self-consistency and parallel thinking, adding generic ``thinking tokens'' and prompting models to re-read the question before answering. Unfortunately, these approaches either inject task-agnostic tokens or mandate heuristics that do not explain -- and often ignore -- the \emph{spontaneous} repetition that many LRMs exhibit at the head of their internal chains. In contrast, we analyze and harness the model's tendency to restate the question, which we term the \emph{Echo of Prompt (EOP)}, as a front-loaded, compute-shaping mechanism. We formalize its probabilistic cost by casting echo removal as rejection-based conditioning and defining the \emph{Echo Likelihood Gap} $Δ\mathcal{L}$ as a computable proxy. This provides the missing theoretical link that links early repetition to likelihood gains and downstream accuracy. However, it does not by itself specify how to exploit EOP. Consequently, we develop \emph{Echo-Distilled SFT (ED-SFT)} to instill an ``echo-then-reason'' pattern through supervised finetuning, and \emph{Echoic Prompting (EP)} to re-ground the model mid-trace without training. While promising, quantifying benefits beyond verbosity is non-trivial. Therefore, we conduct length and suffix-controlled likelihood analyses together with layer-wise attention studies, showing that EOP increases answer to answer-prefix attention in middle layers, consistent with an \emph{attention refocusing} mechanism. We evaluate on GSM8K, MathQA, Hendrycks-MATH, AIME24, and MATH-500 under identical decoding settings and budgets, and find consistent gains over baselines.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful text generators, yet they can produce toxic or harmful content even when given seemingly harmless prompts. This presents a serious safety challenge and can cause real-world harm. Toxicity is often subtle and context-dependent, making it difficult to detect at the token level or through coarse sentence-level signals. Moreover, efforts to mitigate toxicity often face a trade-off between safety and the coherence, or fluency of the generated text. In this work, we present a targeted subspace intervention strategy for identifying and suppressing hidden toxic patterns from underlying model representations, while preserving overall ability to generate safe fluent content. On the RealToxicityPrompts, our method achieves strong mitigation performance compared to existing baselines, with minimal impact on inference complexity. Across multiple LLMs, our approach reduces toxicity of state-of-the-art detoxification systems by 8-20%, while maintaining comparable fluency. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses, we show that our approach achieves effective toxicity reduction without impairing generative performance, consistently outperforming existing baselines.

Abstract: Existing LLM-as-a-Judge systems suffer from three fundamental limitations: limited adaptivity to task- and domain-specific evaluation criteria, systematic biases driven by non-semantic cues such as position, length, format, and model provenance, and evaluation inconsistency that leads to contradictory judgments across different evaluation modes (e.g., pointwise versus pairwise). To address these issues, we propose FairJudge, an adaptive, debiased, and consistent LLM-as-a-Judge. Unlike prior approaches that treat the judge as a static evaluator, FairJudge models judging behavior itself as a learnable and regularized policy. From a data-centric perspective, we construct a high-information-density judging dataset that explicitly injects supervision signals aligned with evaluation behavior. Building on this dataset, we adopt a curriculum-style SFT-DPO-GRPO training paradigm that progressively aligns rubric adherence, bias mitigation, and cross-mode consistency, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results on multiple internal and public benchmarks show that FairJudge consistently improves agreement and F1, reduces non-semantic biases, and outperforms substantially larger instruction-tuned LLMs. All resources will be publicly released after acceptance to facilitate future research.

Experiments on a large-scale dataset of YouTube videos show substantial gains over text-only and multi-modal baselines. Our model also proves more resilient to ASR noise and outperforms a larger text-only baseline on three additional datasets in Portuguese, German, and English, underscoring the value of learned acoustic features for robust topic segmentation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face a fundamental safety-helpfulness trade-off due to static, one-size-fits-all safety policies that lack runtime controllabilityxf, making it difficult to tailor responses to diverse application needs. %As a result, models may over-refuse benign requests or under-constrain harmful ones. We present \textbf{PACT} (Prompt-configured Action via Chain-of-Thought), a framework for dynamic safety control through explicit, risk-aware reasoning. PACT operates under a hierarchical policy architecture: a non-overridable global safety policy establishes immutable boundaries for critical risks (e.g., child safety, violent extremism), while user-defined policies can introduce domain-specific (non-global) risk categories and specify label-to-action behaviors to improve utility in real-world deployment settings. The framework decomposes safety decisions into structured Classify$\rightarrow$Act paths that route queries to the appropriate action (comply, guide, or reject) and render the decision-making process transparent.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PACT achieves near state-of-the-art safety performance under global policy evaluation while attaining the best controllability under user-specific policy evaluation, effectively mitigating the safety-helpfulness trade-off. We will release the PACT model suite, training data, and evaluation protocols to facilitate reproducible research in controllable safety alignment.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Post-training improves instruction-following and helpfulness of large language models (LLMs) but often reduces generation diversity, which leads to repetitive outputs in open-ended settings, a phenomenon known as mode collapse. Motivated by evidence that LLM layers play distinct functional roles, we hypothesize that mode collapse can be localized to specific layers and that restoring a carefully chosen range of layers to their pre-trained weights can recover diversity while maintaining high output quality. To validate this hypothesis and decide which layers to restore, we design a proxy task -- Constrained Random Character(CRC) -- with an explicit validity set and a natural diversity objective. Results on CRC reveal a clear diversity-validity trade-off across restoration ranges and identify configurations that increase diversity with minimal quality loss. Based on these findings, we propose Selective Layer Restoration (SLR), a training-free method that restores selected layers in a post-trained model to their pre-trained weights, yielding a hybrid model with the same architecture and parameter count, incurring no additional inference cost. Across three different tasks (creative writing, open-ended question answering, and multi-step reasoning) and three different model families (Llama, Qwen, and Gemma), we find SLR can consistently and substantially improve output diversity while maintaining high output quality.

Training methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) require human preference data, which remains scarce and largely non-public for many languages beyond English. To address this gap, we introduce compar:IA, an open-source digital public service developed inside the French government and designed to collect large-scale human preference data from a predominantly French-speaking general audience. The platform uses a blind pairwise comparison interface to capture unconstrained, real-world prompts and user judgments across a diverse set of language models, while maintaining low participation friction and privacy-preserving automated filtering. As of 2026-02-07, compar:IA has collected over 600,000 free-form prompts and 250,000 preference votes, with approximately 89% of the data in French. We release three complementary datasets -- conversations, votes, and reactions -- under open licenses, and present initial analyses, including a French-language model leaderboard and user interaction patterns. Beyond the French context, compar:IA is evolving toward an international digital public good, offering reusable infrastructure for multilingual model training, evaluation, and the study of human-AI interaction.

Abstract: The groundbreaking capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for enhancing human-computer interaction through emotion-adaptive Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, deliberately controlling the sentiment in these systems remains challenging. The present study investigates the potential of prompt engineering for controlling sentiment in LLM-generated text, providing a resource-sensitive and accessible alternative to existing methods. Using Ekman's six basic emotions (e.g., joy, disgust), we examine various prompting techniques, including Zero-Shot and Chain-of-Thought prompting using gpt-3.5-turbo, and compare it to fine-tuning. Our results indicate that prompt engineering effectively steers emotions in AI-generated texts, offering a practical and cost-effective alternative to fine-tuning, especially in data-constrained settings. In this regard, Few-Shot prompting with human-written examples was the most effective among other techniques, likely due to the additional task-specific guidance. The findings contribute valuable insights towards developing emotion-adaptive AI systems.

Abstract: Current Information Seeking (InfoSeeking) agents struggle to maintain focus and coherence during long-horizon exploration, as tracking search states, including planning procedure and massive search results, within one plain-text context is inherently fragile. To address this, we introduce \textbf{Table-as-Search (TaS)}, a structured planning framework that reformulates the InfoSeeking task as a Table Completion task. TaS maps each query into a structured table schema maintained in an external database, where rows represent search candidates and columns denote constraints or required information. This table precisely manages the search states: filled cells strictly record the history and search results, while empty cells serve as an explicit search plan. Crucially, TaS unifies three distinct InfoSeeking tasks: Deep Search, Wide Search, and the challenging DeepWide Search. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TaS significantly outperforms numerous state-of-the-art baselines across three kinds of benchmarks, including multi-agent framework and commercial systems. Furthermore, our analysis validates the TaS's superior robustness in long-horizon InfoSeeking, alongside its efficiency, scalability and flexibility. Code and datasets are publicly released at https://github.com/AIDC-AI/Marco-Search-Agent.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) remains indispensable for aligning large language models (LLMs) in subjective domains. To enhance robustness, recent work shifts toward Generative Reward Models (GenRMs) that generate rationales before predicting preferences. Yet in GenRM training and evaluation, practice remains outcome-label-only, leaving reasoning quality unchecked. We show that reasoning fidelity-the consistency between a GenRM's preference decision and reference decision rationales-is highly predictive of downstream RLHF outcomes, beyond standard label accuracy. Specifically, we repurpose existing reward-model benchmarks to compute Spurious Correctness (S-Corr)-the fraction of label-correct decisions with rationales misaligned with golden judgments. Our empirical evaluation reveals substantial S-Corr even for competitive GenRMs, and higher S-Corr is associated with policy degeneration under optimization. To improve fidelity, we propose Rationale-Centric Alignment, R-Align, which augments training with gold judgments and explicitly supervises rationale alignment. R-Align reduces S-Corr on RM benchmarks and yields consistent gains in actor performance across STEM, coding, instruction following, and general tasks.

Abstract: An impediment to using Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning output verification is that LLMs struggle to reliably identify errors in thinking traces, particularly in long outputs, domains requiring expert knowledge, and problems without verifiable rewards. We propose a data-driven approach to automatically construct highly granular reasoning error taxonomies to enhance LLM-driven error detection on unseen reasoning traces. Our findings indicate that classification approaches that leverage these error taxonomies, or "rubrics", demonstrate strong error identification compared to baseline methods in technical domains like coding, math, and chemical engineering. These rubrics can be used to build stronger LLM-as-judge reward functions for reasoning model training via reinforcement learning. Experimental results show that these rewards have the potential to improve models' task accuracy on difficult domains over models trained by general LLMs-as-judges by +45%, and approach performance of models trained by verifiable rewards while using as little as 20% as many gold labels. Through our approach, we extend the usage of reward rubrics from assessing qualitative model behavior to assessing quantitative model correctness on tasks typically learned via RLVR rewards. This extension opens the door for teaching models to solve complex technical problems without a full dataset of gold labels, which are often highly costly to procure.

Abstract: Ambiguity poses persistent challenges in natural language understanding for large language models (LLMs). To better understand how lexical ambiguity can be resolved through the visual domain, we develop an interpretable Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (VWSD) framework. The model leverages CLIP to project ambiguous language and candidate images into a shared multimodal space. We enrich textual embeddings using a dual-channel ensemble of semantic and photo-based prompts with WordNet synonyms, while image embeddings are refined through robust test-time augmentations. We then use cosine similarity to determine the image that best aligns with the ambiguous text. When evaluated on the SemEval-2023 VWSD dataset, enriching the embeddings raises the MRR from 0.7227 to 0.7590 and the Hit Rate from 0.5810 to 0.6220. Ablation studies reveal that dual-channel prompting provides strong, low-latency performance, whereas aggressive image augmentation yields only marginal gains. Additional experiments with WordNet definitions and multilingual prompt ensembles further suggest that noisy external signals tend to dilute semantic specificity, reinforcing the effectiveness of precise, CLIP-aligned prompts for visual word sense disambiguation.

Abstract: A central question in cognitive science is whether conceptual representations converge onto a shared manifold to support generalization, or diverge into orthogonal subspaces to minimize task interference. While prior work has discovered evidence for both, a mechanistic account of how these properties coexist and transform across tasks remains elusive. We propose that representational sharing lies not in the concepts themselves, but in the geometric relations between them. Using number concepts as a testbed and language models as high-dimensional computational substrates, we show that number representations preserve a stable relational structure across tasks. Task-specific representations are embedded in distinct subspaces, with low-level features like magnitude and parity encoded along separable linear directions. Crucially, we find that these subspaces are largely transformable into one another via linear mappings, indicating that representations share relational structure despite being located in distinct subspaces. Together, these results provide a mechanistic lens of how language models balance the shared structure of number representation with functional flexibility. It suggests that understanding arises when task-specific transformations are applied to a shared underlying relational structure of conceptual representations.

Abstract: Multi-turn jailbreaks capture the real threat model for safety-aligned chatbots, where single-turn attacks are merely a special case. Yet existing approaches break under exploration complexity and intent drift. We propose SEMA, a simple yet effective framework that trains a multi-turn attacker without relying on any existing strategies or external data. SEMA comprises two stages. Prefilling self-tuning enables usable rollouts by fine-tuning on non-refusal, well-structured, multi-turn adversarial prompts that are self-generated with a minimal prefix, thereby stabilizing subsequent learning. Reinforcement learning with intent-drift-aware reward trains the attacker to elicit valid multi-turn adversarial prompts while maintaining the same harmful objective. We anchor harmful intent in multi-turn jailbreaks via an intent-drift-aware reward that combines intent alignment, compliance risk, and level of detail. Our open-loop attack regime avoids dependence on victim feedback, unifies single- and multi-turn settings, and reduces exploration complexity. Across multiple datasets, victim models, and jailbreak judges, our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack success rates (ASR), outperforming all single-turn baselines, manually scripted and template-driven multi-turn baselines, as well as our SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) and DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) variants. For instance, SEMA performs an average $80.1\%$ ASR@1 across three closed-source and open-source victim models on AdvBench, 33.9% over SOTA. The approach is compact, reproducible, and transfers across targets, providing a stronger and more realistic stress test for large language model (LLM) safety and enabling automatic redteaming to expose and localize failure modes.

Abstract: We study a persistent failure mode in multi-objective alignment for large language models (LLMs): training improves performance on only a subset of objectives while causing others to degrade. We formalize this phenomenon as cross-objective interference and conduct the first systematic study across classic scalarization algorithms, showing that interference is pervasive and exhibits strong model dependence.
  To explain this phenomenon, we derive a local covariance law showing that an objective improves at first order when its reward exhibits positive covariance with the scalarized score. We extend this analysis to clipped surrogate objectives used in modern alignment, demonstrating that the covariance law remains valid under mild conditions despite clipping. Building on this analysis, we propose Covariance Targeted Weight Adaptation (CTWA), a plug-and-play method that maintains positive covariance between objective rewards and the training signal to effectively mitigate cross-objective interference. Finally, we complement these local improvement conditions with a global convergence analysis under the Polyak--Łojasiewicz condition, establishing when non-convex scalarized optimization achieves global convergence and how cross-objective interference depends on specific model geometric properties.

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models remain a persistent challenge, particularly in multilingual and generative settings where factual consistency is difficult to maintain. While recent models show strong performance on English-centric benchmarks, their behavior across languages, tasks, and hallucination types is not yet well understood. In this work, we introduce Halluverse-M^3, a dataset designed to enable systematic analysis of hallucinations across multiple languages, multiple generation tasks, and multiple hallucination categories. Halluverse-M^3 covers four languages, English, Arabic, Hindi, and Turkish, and supports two generation tasks: question answering and dialogue summarization. The dataset explicitly distinguishes between entity-level, relation-level, and sentence-level hallucinations. Hallucinated outputs are constructed through a controlled editing process and validated by human annotators, ensuring clear alignment between original content and hallucinated generations. Using this dataset, we evaluate a diverse set of contemporary open-source and proprietary language models on fine-grained hallucination detection. Our results show that question answering is consistently easier than dialogue summarization, while sentence-level hallucinations remain challenging even for the strongest models. Performance is highest in English and degrades in lower-resource languages, with Hindi exhibiting the lowest detection accuracy. Overall, Halluverse-M^3 provides a realistic and challenging benchmark for studying hallucinations in multilingual, multi-task settings. We release the dataset to support future research on hallucination detection and mitigation\footnote{https://huggingface.co/datasets/sabdalja/HalluVerse-M3}.

Abstract: Tokenization is a pivotal design choice for neural language modeling in morphologically rich languages (MRLs) such as Turkish, where productive agglutination challenges both vocabulary efficiency and morphological fidelity. Prior studies have explored tokenizer families and vocabulary sizes but typically (i) vary vocabulary without systematically controlling the tokenizer's training corpus, (ii) provide limited intrinsic diagnostics, and (iii) evaluate a narrow slice of downstream tasks. We present the first comprehensive, principled study of Turkish subword tokenization; a "subwords manifest", that jointly varies vocabulary size and tokenizer training corpus size (data and vocabulary coupling), compares multiple tokenizer families under matched parameter budgets (WordPiece, morphology level, and character baselines), and evaluates across semantic (NLI, STS, sentiment analysis, NER), syntactic (POS, dependency parsing), and morphology-sensitive probes. To explain why tokenizers succeed or fail, we introduce a morphology-aware diagnostic toolkit that goes beyond coarse aggregates to boundary-level micro/macro F1, decoupled lemma atomicity vs. surface boundary hits, over/under-segmentation indices, character/word edit distances (CER/WER), continuation rates, and affix-type coverage and token-level atomicity. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) a systematic investigation of the vocabulary-corpus-success triad; (ii) a unified, morphology-aware evaluation framework linking intrinsic diagnostics to extrinsic outcomes; (iii) controlled comparisons identifying when character-level and morphology-level tokenization pay off; and (iv) an open-source release of evaluation code, tokenizer pipelines, and models. As the first work of its kind, this "subwords manifest" delivers actionable guidance for building effective tokenizers in MRLs and establishes a reproducible foundation for future research.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have shown advantages in text generation, particularly due to their inherent ability for parallel decoding. However, constrained by the quality--speed trade-off, existing inference solutions adopt conservative parallel strategies, leaving substantial efficiency potential underexplored. A core challenge is that parallel decoding assumes each position can be filled independently, but tokens are often semantically coupled. Thus, the correct choice at one position constrains valid choices at others. Without modeling these inter-token dependencies, parallel strategies produce deteriorated outputs. Motivated by this insight, we propose DAWN, a training-free, dependency-aware decoding method for fast dLLM inference. DAWN extracts token dependencies and leverages two key motivations: (1) positions dependent on unmasked certain positions become more reliable, (2) simultaneously unmasking strongly coupled uncertain positions induces errors. Given those findings, DAWN leverages a dependency graph to select more reliable unmasking positions at each iteration, achieving high parallelism with negligible loss in generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that DAWN speedups the inference by 1.80-8.06x over baselines while preserving the generation quality. Code is released at https://github.com/lizhuo-luo/DAWN.

Abstract: Large reasoning models achieve strong performance by scaling inference-time chain-of-thought, but this paradigm suffers from quadratic cost, context length limits, and degraded reasoning due to lost-in-the-middle effects. Iterative reasoning mitigates these issues by periodically summarizing intermediate thoughts, yet existing methods rely on supervised learning or fixed heuristics and fail to optimize when to summarize, what to preserve, and how to resume reasoning. We propose InftyThink+, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that optimizes the entire iterative reasoning trajectory, building on model-controlled iteration boundaries and explicit summarization. InftyThink+ adopts a two-stage training scheme with supervised cold-start followed by trajectory-level reinforcement learning, enabling the model to learn strategic summarization and continuation decisions. Experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B show that InftyThink+ improves accuracy by 21% on AIME24 and outperforms conventional long chain-of-thought reinforcement learning by a clear margin, while also generalizing better to out-of-distribution benchmarks. Moreover, InftyThink+ significantly reduces inference latency and accelerates reinforcement learning training, demonstrating improved reasoning efficiency alongside stronger performance.

The running times of our algorithms are all of the form $\widetilde{O}(p^{O(1)}_{\max}+n)$ or $\widetilde{O}(p^{O(1)}_{\max} \cdot n)$, where $p_{\max}$ is the maximum processing time in the input. These improve upon the time complexity of previously known algorithms for moderate values of $p_{\max}$.

Abstract: Range queries are simple and popular types of queries used in data retrieval. However, extracting exact and complete information using range queries is costly. As a remedy, some previous work proposed a faster principle, {\em approximate} search with range queries, also called single range cover (SRC) search. It can, however, produce some false positives. In this work we introduce a new SRC search structure, a $c$-DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), which provably decreases the average number of false positives by logarithmic factor while keeping asymptotically same time and memory complexities as a classic tree structure. A $c$-DAG is a tunable augmentation of the 1D-Tree with denser overlapping branches ($c \geq 3$ children per node). We perform a competitive analysis of a $c$-DAG with respect to 1D-Tree and derive an additive constant time overhead and a multiplicative logarithmic improvement of the false positives ratio, on average. We also provide a generic framework to extend our results to empirical distributions of queries, and demonstrate its effectiveness for Gowalla dataset. Finally, we quantify and discuss security and privacy aspects of SRC search on $c$-DAG vs 1D-Tree, mainly mitigation of structural leakage, which makes $c$-DAG a good data structure candidate for deployment in privacy-preserving systems (e.g., searchable encryption) and multimedia retrieval.

Abstract: This study examines the hierarchical structure of financial needs as articulated in social media discourse, employing generative AI techniques to analyze large-scale textual data. While human needs encompass a broad spectrum from fundamental survival to psychological fulfillment financial needs are particularly critical, influencing both individual well-being and day-to-day decision-making. Our research advances the understanding of financial behavior by utilizing large language models (LLMs) to extract and analyze expressions of financial needs from social media posts. We hypothesize that financial needs are organized hierarchically, progressing from short-term essentials to long-term aspirations, consistent with theoretical frameworks established in the behavioral sciences. Through computational analysis, we demonstrate the feasibility of identifying these needs and validate the presence of a hierarchical structure within them. In addition to confirming this structure, our findings provide novel insights into the content and themes of financial discussions online. By inferring underlying needs from naturally occurring language, this approach offers a scalable and data-driven alternative to conventional survey methodologies, enabling a more dynamic and nuanced understanding of financial behavior in real-world contexts.

Relevant examples include the study of opinion polarization, or the study of political diversity in online content diets. While many research designs rely on operationalizations best suited for the US setting, few allow addressing more general political systems, in which users and media outlets might exhibit stances on multiple ideology and issue dimensions, going beyond traditional Liberal-Conservative or Left-Right scales. To advance the study of more general online ecosystems, we present a dataset pertaining to a population of X/Twitter users, parliamentarians, and media outlets embedded in a political space spanned by dimensions measuring attitudes towards immigration, the EU, liberal values, elites and institutions, nationalism and the environment, in addition to left-right and liberal-conservative scales. We include indicators of individual activity and popularity: mean number of posts per day, number of followers, and number of followees. We provide several benchmarks validating the positions of these entities and discuss several applications for this dataset.

Abstract: This paper proposes a quantum framework for the design of communication topologies in consensus-based multi-agent systems. The communication graph is selected online by solving a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP) that minimizes a cost combining communication and distance penalties with degree-regularization terms, while enforcing exact connectivity through a flow-based formulation. To cope with the combinatorial complexity of this NP-hard problem, we develop a three-block ADMM scheme that decomposes the MIQP into a convex quadratic program in relaxed edge and flow variables, a pure binary unconstrained subproblem, and a closed-form auxiliary update. The binary subproblem is mapped to a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) Hamiltonian and approximately solved via quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE). The resulting time-varying, optimizer-generated Laplacians are applied to linear first- and second-order consensus dynamics. Numerical simulations on networks demonstrate that the proposed method produces connected topologies that satisfy degree constraints, achieve consensus, and incur costs comparable to those of classical mixed-integer solvers, thereby illustrating how quantum algorithms can be embedded as topology optimizers within closed-loop distributed control architectures.

Abstract: This paper proposes a hard-constrained unsupervised learning framework for rapidly solving the non-linear and non-convex AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) problem in real-time operation. Without requiring ground-truth AC-OPF solutions, feasibility and optimality are ensured through a properly designed learning environment and training loss. Inspired by residual learning, the neural network (NN) learns the correction mapping from the DC-OPF solution to the active power setpoints of the generators through re-dispatch. A subsequent optimization model is utilized to restore the optimal AC-OPF solution, and the resulting projection difference is employed as the training loss. A replay buffer is utilized to enhance learning efficiency by fully leveraging past data pairs. The optimization model is cast as a differentiable optimization layer, where the gradient is derived by applying the implicit function theorem to the KKT conditions at the optimal solution. Tested on IEEE-118 and PEGASE-9241 bus systems, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed NN can obtain strictly feasible and near-optimal solutions with reduced computational time compared to conventional optimization solvers. In addition, aided by the updated DC-OPF solution under varying topologies, the trained NN, together with the PF solver, can rapidly find the corresponding AC solution. The proposed method achieves a $40\times$ time speedup, while maintaining an average constraint violation on the order of $10^{-4}$ and an optimization gap below $1\%$.

Abstract: The existing literature on Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) predominantly focuses on two main areas: control system design aimed at achieving grid stability and the techno-economic analysis of BESS dispatch on power grid. However, with the increasing incorporation of ancillary services into power grids, a more comprehensive approach to energy management systems is required. Such an approach should not only optimize revenue generation from BESS but also ensure the safe, efficient, and reliable operation of lithium-ion batteries. This research seeks to bridge this gap by exploring literature that addresses both the economic and operational dimensions of BESS. Specifically, it examines how economic aspects of grid duty cycles can align with control schemes deployed in BESS systems. This alignment, or synergy, could be instrumental in creating robust digital twins virtual representations of BESS systems that enhance both grid stability and revenue potential.
  The literature review is organized into five key categories: (1) ancillary services for BESS, exploring support functions that BESS can provide to power grids; (2) control systems developed for real-time BESS power flow management, ensuring smooth operations under dynamic grid conditions; (3) optimization algorithms for BESS dispatch, focusing on efficient energy allocation strategies; (4) techno-economic analyses of BESS and battery systems to assess their financial viability; and (5) digital twin technologies for real-world BESS deployments, enabling advanced predictive maintenance and performance optimization. This review will identify potential synergies, research gaps, and emerging trends, paving the way for future innovations in BESS management and deployment strategies.

Abstract: This work develops a theoretical framework for safety controller synthesis in discrete-time stochastic nonlinear polynomial systems subject to time-invariant delays (dt-SNPS-td). While safety analysis of stochastic systems using control barrier certificates (CBC) has been widely studied, developing safety controllers for stochastic systems with time delays remains largely unexplored. The main challenge arises from the need to account for the influence of delayed components when formulating and enforcing safety conditions. To address this, we employ Krasovskii control barrier certificates, which extend the conventional CBC framework by augmenting it with an additional summation term that captures the influence of delayed states. This formulation integrates both the current and delayed components into a unified barrier structure, enabling safety synthesis for stochastic systems with time delays. The proposed approach synthesizes safety controllers under input constraints, offering probabilistic safety guarantees robust to such delays: it ensures that all trajectories of the dt-SNPS-td remain within the prescribed safe region while fulfilling a quantified probabilistic bound. To achieve this, our method reformulates the safety constraints as a sum-of-squares optimization program, enabling the systematic construction of Krasovskii CBC together with their associated safety controllers. We validate the proposed framework through three case studies, including two physical systems, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical applicability.

Abstract: Precise magnetic field modeling is fundamental to the closed-loop control of electromagnetic navigation systems (eMNS) and the analytical Multipole Expansion Model (MPEM) is the current standard. However, the MPEM relies on strict physical assumptions regarding source symmetry and isolation, and requires optimization-based calibration that is highly sensitive to initialization. These constraints limit its applicability to systems with complex or irregular coil geometries. This work introduces an alternative modeling paradigm based on multi-layer perceptrons that learns nonlinear magnetic mappings while strictly preserving the linear dependence on currents. As a result, the field models enable fast, closed-form minimum-norm inversion with evaluation times of approximately 1 ms, which is critical for high-bandwidth magnetic control. For model training and evaluation we use large-scale, high-density datasets collected from the research-grade OctoMag and clinical-grade Navion systems. Our results demonstrate that data-driven models achieve predictive fidelity equivalent to the MPEM while maintaining comparable data efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate that straightforward design choices effectively eliminate spurious workspace ill-conditioning frequently reported in MPEM-based calibration. To facilitate future research, we release the complete codebase and datasets open source.

Abstract: The development of efficient and robust dynamic models is fundamental in the field of systems and control engineering. In this paper, a new formulation for the dynamic model of nonlinear mechanical systems, that can be applied to different automotive and robotic case studies, is proposed, together with a modeling procedure allowing to automatically obtain the model formulation. Compared with the Euler-Lagrange formulation, the proposed model is shown to give superior performances in terms of robustness against measurement noise for systems exhibiting dependence on some external variables, as well as in terms of execution time when computing the inverse dynamics of the system.

Abstract: Under the ideal assumption of uniform propagation, cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) provides uniformly high throughput over the network by effectively surrounding each user with its serving access point (AP) set. However, in realistic non-uniform urban propagation environments, it is difficult to consistently select good limited serving AP sets, resulting in significantly degraded throughput, reintroducing "edge-effect" for the worst-served users. To restore the uniformly good performance of scalable CF-mMIMO in realistic urban networks, we formulate a novel multi-objective optimization problem to jointly achieve high throughput by maximizing the sum data rate, uniform throughput by maximizing Jain's fairness index of the throughput per user, and scalability by minimizing the serving AP set size. We then propose the UnifSrv AP selection algorithms to solve this optimization problem, consisting of a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm UnifSrv-DRL and a heuristic algorithm UnifSrv-heu. We conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation of scalable CF-mMIMO under realistic urban network distributions, propagation, and mobility patterns, showing that the prior benchmark AP selection schemes fail to provide uniformly high throughput in practice. By contrast, UnifSrv at least doubles the throughput compared to prior benchmarks, or achieves comparable throughput but with half of the serving AP set size. Importantly, our heuristic algorithm achieves equivalent throughput to our DRL one, but with orders of magnitude lower complexity. We thus for the first time propose an AP selection algorithm that achieves uniformly good CF-mMIMO performance in realistic urban networks with low complexity.

Abstract: This paper presents the design and implementation of data-driven optimal derivative feedback controllers for an active magnetic levitation system. A direct, model-free control design method based on the reinforcement learning framework is compared with an indirect optimal control design derived from a numerically identified mathematical model of the system. For the direct model-free approach, a policy iteration procedure is proposed, which adds an iteration layer called the epoch loop to gather multiple sets of process data, providing a more diverse dataset and helping reduce learning biases. This direct control design method is evaluated against a comparable optimal control solution designed from a plant model obtained through the combined Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control (DMDc) and Prediction Error Minimization (PEM) system identification. Results show that while both controllers can stabilize and improve the performance of the magnetic levitation system when compared to controllers designed from a nominal model, the direct model-free approach consistently outperforms the indirect solution when multiple epochs are allowed. The iterative refinement of the optimal control law over the epoch loop provides the direct approach a clear advantage over the indirect method, which relies on a single set of system data to determine the identified model and control.

Abstract: This research presents a dynamic modeling framework and parameter identification methods for describing the highly nonlinear behaviors of flexibly connected dual-AUV systems. The modeling framework is established based on the lumped mass method, integrating axial elasticity, bending stiffness, added mass and hydrodynamic forces, thereby accurately capturing the time-varying response of the forces and cable configurations. To address the difficulty of directly measuring material-related and hydrodynamic coefficients, this research proposes a parameter identification method that combines the physical model with experimental data. High-precision inversion of the equivalent Youngs modulus and hydrodynamic coefficients is performed through tension experiments under multiple configurations, effectively demonstrating that the identified model maintains predictive consistency in various operational conditions. Further numerical analysis indicates that the dynamic properties of flexible cable exhibit significant nonlinear characteristics, which are highly dependent on material property variations and AUV motion conditions. This nonlinear dynamic behavior results in two typical response states, slack and taut, which are jointly determined by boundary conditions and hydrodynamic effects, significantly affecting the cable configuration and endpoint loads. In this research, the dynamics of flexible cables under complex boundary conditions is revealed, providing a theoretical foundation for the design, optimization and further control research of similar systems.

Abstract: We introduce a Transformer-based Reinforcement Learning framework for autonomous orbital collision avoidance that explicitly models the effects of partial observability and imperfect monitoring in space operations. The framework combines a configurable encounter simulator, a distance-dependent observation model, and a sequential state estimator to represent uncertainty in relative motion. A central contribution of this work is the use of transformer-based Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) architecture, which leverage long-range temporal attention to interpret noisy and intermittent observations more effectively than traditional architectures. This integration provides a foundation for training collision avoidance agents that can operate more reliably under imperfect monitoring environments.

Abstract: We study localization and control for unstable systems under coarse, single-bit sensing. Motivated by understanding the fundamental limitations imposed by such minimal feedback, we identify sufficient conditions under which the initial state can be recovered despite instability and extremely sparse measurements. Building on these conditions, we develop an active localization algorithm that integrates a set-based estimator with a control strategy derived from Voronoi partitions, which provably estimates the initial state while ensuring the agent remains in informative regions. Under the derived conditions, the proposed approach guarantees exponential contraction of the initial-state uncertainty, and the result is further supported by numerical experiments. These findings can offer theoretical insight into localization in robotics, where sensing is often limited to coarse abstractions such as keyframes, segmentations, or line-based features.

Abstract: Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) has transformed gastrointestinal (GI) diagnostics by enabling noninvasive visualization of the digestive tract, yet its diagnostic yield remains constrained by the absence of biopsy capability, as histological analysis is still the gold standard for confirming disease. Conventional biopsy using forceps, needles, or rotating blades is invasive, limited in reach, and carries risks of perforation or mucosal trauma, while fluid- or microbiota-sampling capsules cannot provide structured tissue for pathology, leaving a critical gap in swallowable biopsy solutions. Here we present the Kiri-Capsule, a kirigami-inspired capsule robot that integrates deployable PI-film flaps actuated by a compact dual-cam mechanism to achieve minimally invasive and repeatable tissue collection. The kirigami surface remains flat during locomotion but transforms into sharp protrusions upon cam-driven stretching, enabling controlled penetration followed by rotary scraping, with specimens retained in internal fan-shaped cavities. Bench tests confirmed that PI films exhibit a Young's modulus of approximately 20 MPa and stable deployment angles (about 34$^\circ$ at 15% strain), while ex vivo porcine studies demonstrated shallow penetration depths (median $\sim$0.61 mm, range 0.46--0.66 mm) and biopsy yields comparable to standard forceps (mean $\sim$10.9 mg for stomach and $\sim$18.9 mg for intestine), with forces within safe ranges reported for GI biopsy. These findings demonstrate that the Kiri-Capsule bridges passive imaging and functional biopsy, providing a swallowable, depth-controlled, and histology-ready solution that advances capsule-based diagnostics toward safe and effective clinical application.

Abstract: World models offer a promising avenue for more faithfully capturing complex dynamics, including contacts and non-rigidity, as well as complex sensory information, such as visual perception, in situations where standard simulators struggle. However, these models are computationally complex to evaluate, posing a challenge for popular RL approaches that have been successfully used with simulators to solve complex locomotion tasks but yet struggle with manipulation. This paper introduces a method that bypasses simulators entirely, training RL policies inside world models learned from robots' interactions with real environments. At its core, our approach enables policy training with large-scale diffusion models via a novel decoupled first-order gradient (FoG) method: a full-scale world model generates accurate forward trajectories, while a lightweight latent-space surrogate approximates its local dynamics for efficient gradient computation. This coupling of a local and global world model ensures high-fidelity unrolling alongside computationally tractable differentiation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on the Push-T manipulation task, where it significantly outperforms PPO in sample efficiency. We further evaluate our approach through an ego-centric object manipulation task with a quadruped. Together, these results demonstrate that learning inside data-driven world models is a promising pathway for solving hard-to-model RL tasks in image space without reliance on hand-crafted physics simulators.

Abstract: People with lower and upper body disabilities can benefit from wheelchairs and robotic arms to improve mobility and independence. Prior assistive interfaces, such as touchscreens and voice-driven predefined commands, often remain unintuitive and struggle to capture complex user intent. We propose a natural, dialogue based human robot interaction protocol that simulates an intelligent agent capable of communicating with users to understand intent and execute assistive actions. In a pilot study, five participants completed five assistive tasks (cleaning, drinking, feeding, drawer opening, and door opening) through dialogue-based interaction with a wheelchair and robotic arm. As a baseline, participants were required to open a door using the manual control (a wheelchair joystick and a game controller for the arm) and complete a questionnaire to gather their feedback. By analyzing the post-study questionnaires, we found that most participants enjoyed the dialogue-based interaction and assistive robot autonomy.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Mechacnially prOgrammed Radius-adjustable PHysical (MORPH) wheel, a fully passive variable-radius wheel that embeds mechanical behavior logic for torque-responsive transformation. Unlike conventional variable transmission systems relying on actuators, sensors, and active control, the MORPH wheel achieves passive adaptation solely through its geometry and compliant structure. The design integrates a torque-response coupler and spring-loaded connecting struts to mechanically adjust the wheel radius between 80 mm and 45 mm in response to input torque, without any electrical components. The MORPH wheel provides three unique capabilities rarely achieved simultaneously in previous passive designs: (1) bidirectional operation with unlimited rotation through a symmetric coupler; (2) high torque capacity exceeding 10 N with rigid power transmission in drive mode; and (3) precise and repeatable transmission ratio control governed by deterministic kinematics. A comprehensive analytical model was developed to describe the wheel's mechanical behavior logic, establishing threshold conditions for mode switching between direct drive and radius transformation. Experimental validation confirmed that the measured torque-radius and force-displacement characteristics closely follow theoretical predictions across wheel weights of 1.8-2.8kg. Robot-level demonstrations on varying loads (0-25kg), slopes, and unstructured terrains further verified that the MORPH wheel passively adjusts its radius to provide optimal transmission ratio. The MORPH wheel exemplifies a mechanically programmed structure, embedding intelligent, context-dependent behavior directly into its physical design. This approach offers a new paradigm for passive variable transmission and mechanical intelligence in robotic mobility systems operating in unpredictable or control-limited environments.

Abstract: Validating Augmented Reality (AR) tracking and interaction models requires precise, repeatable ground-truth motion. However, human users cannot reliably perform consistent motion due to biomechanical variability. Robotic manipulators are promising to act as human motion proxies if they can mimic human movements. In this work, we design and implement ARBot, a real-time teleoperation platform that can effectively capture natural human motion and accurately replay the movements via robotic manipulators. ARBot includes two capture models: stable wrist motion capture via a custom CV and IMU pipeline, and natural 6-DOF control via a mobile application. We design a proactively-safe QP controller to ensure smooth, jitter-free execution of the robotic manipulator, enabling it to function as a high-fidelity record and replay physical proxy. We open-source ARBot and release a benchmark dataset of 132 human and synthetic trajectories captured using ARBot to support controllable and scalable AR evaluation.

Abstract: Mobile manipulators are known for their superior mobility over manipulators on fixed bases, offering promising applications in smart industry and housekeeping scenarios. The dynamic coupling nature between the mobile base and the manipulator presents challenges for force interactive tasks of the mobile manipulator. However, current strategies often fail to account for this coupling in such scenarios. To address this, this paper presents a dynamic coupling-integrated manipulator model that requires only the manipulator dynamics and the mobile base kinematics, which simplifies the modeling process. In addition, embedding the dynamic model, an extended uncertainty and disturbance estimator (UDE) is proposed for the mobile manipulator, which separately estimates the dynamic coupling terms and other unmodeled uncertainties, incorporating them into the feedforward and feedback control loops, respectively. The proposed approach increases the speed of response of the system and improves the dynamic robot-environment interaction (REI) performance of the mobile manipulator. A series of simulations and experiments of a wall-cleaning task are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Ablation studies demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves the motion/force tracking performance when the mobile base is in dynamic motion.

Abstract: Constraining motion to a flat surface is a fundamental requirement for equipment across science and engineering. Modern precision robotic motion systems, such as gantries, rely on the flatness of components, including guide rails and granite surface plates. However, translating this static flatness into motion requires precise internal alignment and tight-tolerance components that create long, error-sensitive reference chains. Here, we show that by using the geometric inversion of a sphere into a plane, we can produce robotic motion systems that derive planarity entirely from link lengths and connectivity. This allows planar motion to emerge from self-referencing geometric constraints, and without external metrology. We demonstrate these Flat-Plane Mechanisms (FPMs) from micron to meter scales and show that fabrication errors can be attenuated by an order of magnitude in the resulting flatness. Finally, we present a robotic FPM-based 3-axis positioning system that can be used for metrology surface scans ($\pm 12$-mm) and 3D printing inside narrow containers. This work establishes an alternative geometric foundation for planar motion that can be realized across size scales and opens new possibilities in metrology, fabrication, and micro-positioning.

Abstract: Autonomous drone racing pushes the boundaries of high-speed motion planning and multi-agent strategic decision-making. Success in this domain requires drones not only to navigate at their limits but also to anticipate and counteract competitors' actions. In this paper, we study a fundamental question that arises in this domain: how deeply should an agent strategize before taking an action? To this end, we compare two planning paradigms: the Model Predictive Game (MPG), which finds interaction-aware strategies at the expense of longer computation times, and contouring Model Predictive Control (MPC), which computes strategies rapidly but does not reason about interactions. We perform extensive experiments to study this trade-off, revealing that MPG outperforms MPC at moderate velocities but loses its advantage at higher speeds due to latency. To address this shortcoming, we propose a Learned Model Predictive Game (LMPG) approach that amortizes model predictive gameplay to reduce latency. In both simulation and hardware experiments, we benchmark our approach against MPG and MPC in head-to-head races, finding that LMPG outperforms both baselines.

Abstract: This study presents an internalized morphogenesis model for autonomous systems, such as swarm robotics and micro-nanomachines, that eliminates the need for external spatial computation. Traditional self-organizing models often require calculations across the entire coordinate space, including empty areas, which is impractical for resource-constrained physical modules. Our proposed model achieves complex morphogenesis through strictly local interactions between adjacent modules within the "body." By extending the "Ishida token model," modules exchange integer values using an RD-inspired discrete analogue without solving differential equations. The internal potential, derived from token accumulation and aging, guides autonomous growth, shrinkage, and replication. Simulations on a hexagonal grid demonstrated the emergence of limb-like extensions, self-division, and robust regeneration capabilities following structural amputation. A key feature is the use of the body boundary as a natural sink for information entropy (tokens) to maintain a dynamic equilibrium. These results indicate that sophisticated morphological behaviors can emerge from minimal, internal-only rules. This framework offers a computationally efficient and biologically plausible approach to developing self-repairing, adaptive, and autonomous hardware.

Abstract: Robot Foundation Models such as Vision-Language-Action models are rapidly reshaping how robot policies are trained and deployed, replacing hand-designed planners with end-to-end generative action models. While these systems demonstrate impressive generalization, it remains unclear whether they fundamentally resolve the long-standing challenges of robotics. We address this question by analyzing action hallucinations that violate physical constraints and their extension to plan-level failures. Focusing on latent-variable generative policies, we show that hallucinations often arise from structural mismatches between feasible robot behavior and common model architectures. We study three such barriers -- topological, precision, and horizon -- and show how they impose unavoidable tradeoffs. Our analysis provides mechanistic explanations for reported empirical failures of generative robot policies and suggests principled directions for improving reliability and trustworthiness, without abandoning their expressive power.

Abstract: Humanoid loco-manipulation requires executing precise manipulation tasks while maintaining dynamic stability amid base motion and impacts. Existing approaches typically formulate commands in body-centric frames, fail to inherently correct cumulative world-frame drift induced by legged locomotion. We reformulate the problem as world-frame end-effector tracking and propose HiWET, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that decouples global reasoning from dynamic execution. The high-level policy generates subgoals that jointly optimize end-effector accuracy and base positioning in the world frame, while the low-level policy executes these commands under stability constraints. We introduce a Kinematic Manifold Prior (KMP) that embeds the manipulation manifold into the action space via residual learning, reducing exploration dimensionality and mitigating kinematically invalid behaviors. Extensive simulation and ablation studies demonstrate that HiWET achieves precise and stable end-effector tracking in long-horizon world-frame tasks. We validate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of the low-level policy on a physical humanoid, demonstrating stable locomotion under diverse manipulation commands. These results indicate that explicit world-frame reasoning combined with hierarchical control provides an effective and scalable solution for long-horizon humanoid loco-manipulation.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) requires embodied agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate through complex continuous 3D environments. However, the dominant imitation learning paradigm suffers from exposure bias, where minor deviations during inference lead to compounding errors. While DAgger-style approaches attempt to mitigate this by correcting error states, we identify a critical limitation: Instruction-State Misalignment. Forcing an agent to learn recovery actions from off-track states often creates supervision signals that semantically conflict with the original instruction. In response to these challenges, we introduce BudVLN, an online framework that learns from on-policy rollouts by constructing supervision to match the current state distribution. BudVLN performs retrospective rectification via counterfactual re-anchoring and decision-conditioned supervision synthesis, using a geodesic oracle to synthesize corrective trajectories that originate from valid historical states, ensuring semantic consistency. Experiments on the standard R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks demonstrate that BudVLN consistently mitigates distribution shift and achieves state-of-the-art performance in both Success Rate and SPL.

Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using 3D LiDAR has emerged as a cornerstone for autonomous navigation in robotics. While feature-based SLAM systems have achieved impressive results by leveraging edge and planar structures, they often suffer from the inconsistent estimator associated with feature parameterization and estimated covariance. In this work, we present a consistency-improved LiDAR-inertial bundle adjustment (BA) with tailored parameterization and estimator. First, we propose a stereographic-projection representation parameterizing the planar and edge features, and conduct a comprehensive observability analysis to support its integrability with consistent estimator. Second, we implement a LiDAR-inertial BA with Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) formulation and First-Estimate Jacobians (FEJ) to preserve the accurate estimated covariance and observability properties of the system. Last, we apply our proposed BA method to a LiDAR-inertial odometry.

Abstract: Embodied agents struggle to generalize to new environments, even when those environments share similar underlying structures to their training settings. Most current approaches to generating these training environments follow an open-loop paradigm, without considering the agent's current performance. While procedural generation methods can produce diverse scenes, diversity without feedback from the agent is inefficient. The generated environments may be trivially easy, providing limited learning signal. To address this, we present a proof-of-concept for closed-loop environment generation that adapts difficulty to the agent's current capabilities. Our system employs a controllable environment representation, extracts fine-grained performance feedback beyond binary success or failure, and implements a closed-loop adaptation mechanism that translates this feedback into environment modifications. This feedback-driven approach generates training environments that more challenging in the ways the agent needs to improve, enabling more efficient learning and better generalization to novel settings.

Abstract: In contact-rich tasks, while position trajectories are often easy to obtain, appropriate force commands are typically unknown. Although it is conceivable to generate force commands using a pretrained foundation model such as Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, force control is highly dependent on the specific hardware of the robot, which makes the application of such models challenging. To bridge this gap, we propose a force generative model that estimates force commands from given position trajectories. However, when dealing with unseen position trajectories, the model struggles to generate accurate force commands. To address this, we introduce a feedback control mechanism. Our experiments reveal that feedback control does not converge when the force generative model has memory. We therefore adopt a model without memory, enabling stable feedback control. This approach allows the system to generate force commands effectively, even for unseen position trajectories, improving generalization for real-world robot writing tasks.

To address these challenges, we present an end-to-end framework for vision-driven humanoid locomotion. For robust sim-to-real transfer, we develop a high-fidelity depth sensor simulation that captures stereo matching artifacts and calibration uncertainties inherent in real-world sensing. We further propose a vision-aware behavior distillation approach that combines latent space alignment with noise-invariant auxiliary tasks, enabling effective knowledge transfer from privileged height maps to noisy depth observations. For versatile terrain adaptation, we introduce terrain-specific reward shaping integrated with multi-critic and multi-discriminator learning, where dedicated networks capture the distinct dynamics and motion priors of each terrain type. We validate our approach on two humanoid platforms equipped with different stereo depth cameras. The resulting policy demonstrates robust performance across diverse environments, seamlessly handling extreme challenges such as high platforms and wide gaps, as well as fine-grained tasks including bidirectional long-term staircase traversal.

Abstract: Achieving stable and energy-efficient locomotion is essential for humanoid robots to operate continuously in real-world applications. Existing MPC and RL approaches often rely on energy-related metrics embedded within a multi-objective optimization framework, which require extensive hyperparameter tuning and often result in suboptimal policies. To address these challenges, we propose ECO (Energy-Constrained Optimization), a constrained RL framework that separates energy-related metrics from rewards, reformulating them as explicit inequality constraints. This method provides a clear and interpretable physical representation of energy costs, enabling more efficient and intuitive hyperparameter tuning for improved energy efficiency. ECO introduces dedicated constraints for energy consumption and reference motion, enforced by the Lagrangian method, to achieve stable, symmetric, and energy-efficient walking for humanoid robots. We evaluated ECO against MPC, standard RL with reward shaping, and four state-of-the-art constrained RL methods. Experiments, including sim-to-sim and sim-to-real transfers on the kid-sized humanoid robot BRUCE, demonstrate that ECO significantly reduces energy consumption compared to baselines while maintaining robust walking performance. These results highlight a substantial advancement in energy-efficient humanoid locomotion.

Abstract: In the evolving field of robotics, the challenge of Object Navigation (ON) in household environments has attracted significant interest. Existing ON benchmarks typically place objects in locations guided by general scene priors, without accounting for the specific placement habits of individual users. This omission limits the adaptability of navigation agents in personalized household environments. To address this, we introduce User-centric Object Navigation (UcON), a new benchmark that incorporates user-specific object placement habits, referred to as user habits. This benchmark requires agents to leverage these user habits for more informed decision-making during navigation. UcON encompasses approximately 22,600 user habits across 489 object categories. UcON is, to our knowledge, the first benchmark that explicitly formalizes and evaluates habit-conditioned object navigation at scale and covers the widest range of target object categories. Additionally, we propose a habit retrieval module to extract and utilize habits related to target objects, enabling agents to infer their likely locations more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that current SOTA methods exhibit substantial performance degradation under habit-driven object placement, while integrating user habits consistently improves success rates.

Abstract: Vision-based models for robotic grasping automate critical, repetitive, and draining industrial tasks. Existing approaches are typically limited in two ways: they either target a single gripper and are potentially applied on costly dual-arm setups, or rely on custom hybrid grippers that require ad-hoc learning procedures with logic that cannot be transferred across tasks, restricting their general applicability. In this work, we present MultiGraspNet, a novel multitask 3D deep learning method that predicts feasible poses simultaneously for parallel and vacuum grippers within a unified framework, enabling a single robot to handle multiple end effectors. The model is trained on the richly annotated GraspNet-1Billion and SuctionNet-1Billion datasets, which have been aligned for the purpose, and generates graspability masks quantifying the suitability of each scene point for successful grasps. By sharing early-stage features while maintaining gripper-specific refiners, MultiGraspNet effectively leverages complementary information across grasping modalities, enhancing robustness and adaptability in cluttered scenes. We characterize MultiGraspNet's performance with an extensive experimental analysis, demonstrating its competitiveness with single-task models on relevant benchmarks. We run real-world experiments on a single-arm multi-gripper robotic setup showing that our approach outperforms the vacuum baseline, grasping 16% percent more seen objects and 32% more of the novel ones, while obtaining competitive results for the parallel task.

Abstract: Recent progress in robotic world models has leveraged video diffusion transformers to predict future observations conditioned on historical states and actions. While these models can simulate realistic visual outcomes, they often exhibit poor action-following precision, hindering their utility for downstream robotic learning. In this work, we introduce World-VLA-Loop, a closed-loop framework for the joint refinement of world models and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies. We propose a state-aware video world model that functions as a high-fidelity interactive simulator by jointly predicting future observations and reward signals. To enhance reliability, we introduce the SANS dataset, which incorporates near-success trajectories to improve action-outcome alignment within the world model. This framework enables a closed-loop for reinforcement learning (RL) post-training of VLA policies entirely within a virtual environment. Crucially, our approach facilitates a co-evolving cycle: failure rollouts generated by the VLA policy are iteratively fed back to refine the world model precision, which in turn enhances subsequent RL optimization. Evaluations across simulation and real-world tasks demonstrate that our framework significantly boosts VLA performance with minimal physical interaction, establishing a mutually beneficial relationship between world modeling and policy learning for general-purpose robotics.

Abstract: While generalist robot policies hold significant promise for learning diverse manipulation skills through imitation, their performance is often hindered by the long-tail distribution of training demonstrations. Policies learned on such data, which is heavily skewed towards a few data-rich head tasks, frequently exhibit poor generalization when confronted with the vast number of data-scarce tail tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the pervasive long-tail challenge inherent in policy learning. Our analysis begins by demonstrating the inefficacy of conventional long-tail learning strategies (e.g., re-sampling) for improving the policy's performance on tail tasks. We then uncover the underlying mechanism for this failure, revealing that data scarcity on tail tasks directly impairs the policy's spatial reasoning capability. To overcome this, we introduce Approaching-Phase Augmentation (APA), a simple yet effective scheme that transfers knowledge from data-rich head tasks to data-scarce tail tasks without requiring external demonstrations. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of APA. Our code and demos are publicly available at: https://mldxy.github.io/Project-VLA-long-tail/.

Abstract: Robotic-assisted surgery has emerged as a promising approach to improve surgical ergonomics, precision, and workflow efficiency, particularly in complex procedures such as cervical spine surgery. In this study, we evaluate the performance of a collaborative robotic system designed to assist surgeons in drilling tasks by assessing its accuracy in executing predefined trajectories. A total of 14 drillings were performed by eight experienced cervical surgeons, utilizing a robotic-assisted setup aimed at ensuring stability and alignment. The primary objective of this study is to quantify the deviations in the position and orientation of the drilling tool relative to the planned trajectory, providing insights into the system's reliability and potential impact on clinical outcomes. While the primary function of robotic assistance in surgery is to enhance surgeon comfort and procedural guidance rather than solely optimizing precision, understanding the system's accuracy remains crucial for its effective integration into surgical practices part of this primary experimental feedback, the study offers an in-depth analysis of the co-manipulated robotic system's performance, focusing on the experimental setup and error evaluation methods. The findings of this study will contribute to the ongoing development of robotic-assisted cervical surgery, highlighting both its advantages and areas for improvement in achieving safer and more efficient surgical workflows

Abstract: Autonomous agents that perform everyday manipulation actions need to ensure that their body motions are semantically correct with respect to a task request, causally effective within their environment, and feasible for their embodiment. In order to enable robots to verify these properties, we introduce the Law of Task-Achieving Body Motion as an axiomatic correctness specification for body motions. To that end we introduce scoped Task-Environment-Embodiment (TEE) classes that represent world states as Semantic Digital Twins (SDTs) and define applicable physics models to decompose task achievement into three predicates: SatisfiesRequest for semantic request satisfaction over SDT state evolution; Causes for causal sufficiency under the scoped physics model; and CanPerform for safety and feasibility verification at the embodiment level. This decomposition yields a reusable, implementation-independent interface that supports motion synthesis and the verification of given body motions. It also supports typed failure diagnosis (semantic, causal, embodiment and out-of-scope), feasibility across robots and environments, and counterfactual reasoning about robot body motions. We demonstrate the usability of the law in practice by instantiating it for articulated container manipulation in kitchen environments on three contrasting mobile manipulation platforms

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models typically inject proprioception only as a late conditioning signal, which prevents robot state from shaping instruction understanding and from influencing which visual tokens are attended throughout the policy. We introduce ThinkProprio, which converts proprioception into a sequence of text tokens in the VLM embedding space and fuses them with the task instruction at the input. This early fusion lets embodied state participate in subsequent visual reasoning and token selection, biasing computation toward action-critical evidence while suppressing redundant visual tokens. In a systematic ablation over proprioception encoding, state entry point, and action-head conditioning, we find that text tokenization is more effective than learned projectors, and that retaining roughly 15% of visual tokens can match the performance of using the full token set. Across CALVIN, LIBERO, and real-world manipulation, ThinkProprio matches or improves over strong baselines while reducing end-to-end inference latency over 50%.

Abstract: Current approaches for humanoid whole-body manipulation, primarily relying on teleoperation or visual sim-to-real reinforcement learning, are hindered by hardware logistics and complex reward engineering. Consequently, demonstrated autonomous skills remain limited and are typically restricted to controlled environments. In this paper, we present the Humanoid Manipulation Interface (HuMI), a portable and efficient framework for learning diverse whole-body manipulation tasks across various environments. HuMI enables robot-free data collection by capturing rich whole-body motion using portable hardware. This data drives a hierarchical learning pipeline that translates human motions into dexterous and feasible humanoid skills. Extensive experiments across five whole-body tasks--including kneeling, squatting, tossing, walking, and bimanual manipulation--demonstrate that HuMI achieves a 3x increase in data collection efficiency compared to teleoperation and attains a 70% success rate in unseen environments.

Abstract: Developing robotic manipulation policies is iterative and hypothesis-driven: researchers test tactile sensing, gripper geometries, and sensor placements through real-world data collection and training. Yet even minor end-effector changes often require mechanical refitting and system re-integration, slowing iteration. We present RAPID, a full-stack reconfigurable platform designed to reduce this friction. RAPID is built around a tool-free, modular hardware architecture that unifies handheld data collection and robot deployment, and a matching software stack that maintains real-time awareness of the underlying hardware configuration through a driver-level Physical Mask derived from USB events. This modular hardware architecture reduces reconfiguration to seconds and makes systematic multi-modal ablation studies practical, allowing researchers to sweep diverse gripper and sensing configurations without repeated system bring-up. The Physical Mask exposes modality presence as an explicit runtime signal, enabling auto-configuration and graceful degradation under sensor hot-plug events, so policies can continue executing when sensors are physically added or removed. System-centric experiments show that RAPID reduces the setup time for multi-modal configurations by two orders of magnitude compared to traditional workflows and preserves policy execution under runtime sensor hot-unplug events. The hardware designs, drivers, and software stack are open-sourced at https://rapid-kit.github.io/ .

Abstract: Safe and computationally efficient local planning for mobile robots in dense, unstructured human crowds remains a fundamental challenge. Moreover, ensuring that robot trajectories are similar to how a human moves will increase the acceptance of the robot in human environments. In this paper, we present Crowd-FM, a learning-based approach to address both safety and human-likeness challenges. Our approach has two novel components. First, we train a Conditional Flow-Matching (CFM) policy over a dataset of optimally controlled trajectories to learn a set of collision-free primitives that a robot can choose at any given scenario. The chosen optimal control solver can generate multi-modal collision-free trajectories, allowing the CFM policy to learn a diverse set of maneuvers. Secondly, we learn a score function over a dataset of human demonstration trajectories that provides a human-likeness score for the flow primitives. At inference time, computing the optimal trajectory requires selecting the one with the highest score. Our approach improves the state-of-the-art by showing that our CFM policy alone can produce collision-free navigation with a higher success rate than existing learning-based baselines. Furthermore, when augmented with inference-time refinement, our approach can outperform even expensive optimisation-based planning approaches. Finally, we validate that our scoring network can select trajectories closer to the expert data than a manually designed cost function.

Abstract: Many automated manufacturing processes rely on industrial robot arms to move process-specific tools along workpiece surfaces. In applications like grinding, sanding, spray painting, or inspection, they need to cover a workpiece fully while keeping their tools perpendicular to its surface. While there are approaches to generate trajectories for these applications, there are no sufficient methods for analyzing the feasibility of full surface coverage. This work proposes a sampling-based approach for continuous coverage estimation that explores reachable surface regions in the configuration space. We define an extended ambient configuration space that allows for the representation of tool position and orientation constraints. A continuation-based approach is used to explore it using two different sampling strategies. A thorough evaluation across different kinematics and environments analyzes their runtime and efficiency. This validates our ability to accurately and efficiently calculate surface coverage for complex surfaces in complicated environments.

Abstract: We address the over-constrained planning problem in semi-static environments. The planning objective is to find a best-effort solution that avoids all hard constraint regions while minimally traversing the least risky areas. Conventional methods often rely on pre-defined area costs, limiting generalizations. Further, the spatial continuity of navigation spaces makes it difficult to identify regions that are passable without overestimation. To overcome these challenges, we propose SuReNav, a superpixel graph-based constraint relaxation and navigation method that imitates human-like safe and efficient navigation. Our framework consists of three components: 1) superpixel graph map generation with regional constraints, 2) regional-constraint relaxation using graph neural network trained on human demonstrations for safe and efficient navigation, and 3) interleaving relaxation, planning, and execution for complete navigation. We evaluate our method against state-of-the-art baselines on 2D semantic maps and 3D maps from OpenStreetMap, achieving the highest human-likeness score of complete navigation while maintaining a balanced trade-off between efficiency and safety. We finally demonstrate its scalability and generalization performance in real-world urban navigation with a quadruped robot, Spot.

Abstract: Flapping-wing micro air vehicles (FWMAVs) have demonstrated remarkable bio-inspired agility, yet tailless two-winged configurations remain largely unexplored due to their complex fluid-structure and wing-body coupling. Here we present \textit{AirPulse}, a 26-gram butterfly-inspired FWMAV that achieves fully onboard, closed-loop, untethered flight without auxiliary control surfaces. The AirPulse robot replicates key biomechanical traits of butterfly flight, including low wing aspect ratio, compliant carbon-fiber-reinforced wings, and low-frequency, high-amplitude flapping that induces cyclic variations in the center of gravity and moment of inertia, producing characteristic body undulation. We establish a quantitative mapping between flapping modulation parameters and force-torque generation, and introduce the Stroke Timing Asymmetry Rhythm (STAR) generator, enabling smooth, stable, and linearly parameterized wingstroke asymmetry for flapping control. Integrating these with an attitude controller, the AirPulse robot maintains pitch and yaw stability despite strong oscillatory dynamics. Free-flight experiments demonstrate stable climbing and turning maneuvers via either angle offset or stroke timing modulation, marking the first onboard controlled flight of the lightest two-winged, tailless butterfly-inspired FWMAV reported in peer-reviewed literature. This work corroborates a foundational platform for lightweight, collision-proof FWMAVs, bridging biological inspiration with practical aerial robotics. Their non-invasive maneuverability is ideally suited for real-world applications, such as confined-space inspection and ecological monitoring, inaccessible to traditional drones, while their biomechanical fidelity provides a physical model to decode the principles underlying the erratic yet efficient flight of real butterflies.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce DynaRetarget, a complete pipeline for retargeting human motions to humanoid control policies. The core component of DynaRetarget is a novel Sampling-Based Trajectory Optimization (SBTO) framework that refines imperfect kinematic trajectories into dynamically feasible motions. SBTO incrementally advances the optimization horizon, enabling optimization over the entire trajectory for long-horizon tasks. We validate DynaRetarget by successfully retargeting hundreds of humanoid-object demonstrations and achieving higher success rates than the state of the art. The framework also generalizes across varying object properties, such as mass, size, and geometry, using the same tracking objective. This ability to robustly retarget diverse demonstrations opens the door to generating large-scale synthetic datasets of humanoid loco-manipulation trajectories, addressing a major bottleneck in real-world data collection.

Abstract: Visual servoing is fundamental to robotic applications, enabling precise positioning and control. However, applying it to textureless objects remains a challenge due to the absence of reliable visual features. Moreover, adverse visual conditions, such as occlusions, often corrupt visual feedback, leading to reduced accuracy and instability in visual servoing. In this work, we build upon learning-based keypoint detection for textureless objects and propose a method that enhances robustness by tightly integrating perception and control in a closed loop. Specifically, we employ an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) that integrates per-frame keypoint measurements to estimate 6D object pose, which drives pose-based visual servoing (PBVS) for control. The resulting camera motion, in turn, enhances the tracking of subsequent keypoints, effectively closing the perception-control loop. Additionally, unlike standard PBVS, we propose a probabilistic control law that computes both camera velocity and its associated uncertainty, enabling uncertainty-aware control for safe and reliable operation. We validate our approach on real-world robotic platforms using quantitative metrics and grasping experiments, demonstrating that our method outperforms traditional visual servoing techniques in both accuracy and practical application.

Abstract: Robotic tasks involving contact interactions pose significant challenges for trajectory optimization due to discontinuous dynamics. Conventional formulations typically assume deterministic contact events, which limit robustness and adaptability in real-world settings. In this work, we propose SURE, a robust trajectory optimization framework that explicitly accounts for contact timing uncertainty. By allowing multiple trajectories to branch from possible pre-impact states and later rejoin a shared trajectory, SURE achieves both robustness and computational efficiency within a unified optimization framework. We evaluate SURE on two representative tasks with unknown impact times. In a cart-pole balancing task involving uncertain wall location, SURE achieves an average improvement of 21.6% in success rate when branch switching is enabled during control. In an egg-catching experiment using a robotic manipulator, SURE improves the success rate by 40%. These results demonstrate that SURE substantially enhances robustness compared to conventional nominal formulations.

Abstract: Zero-order optimization has recently received significant attention for designing optimal trajectories and policies for robotic systems. However, most existing methods (e.g., MPPI, CEM, and CMA-ES) are local in nature, as they rely on gradient estimation. In this paper, we introduce consensus-based optimization (CBO) to robotics, which is guaranteed to converge to a global optimum under mild assumptions. We provide theoretical analysis and illustrative examples that give intuition into the fundamental differences between CBO and existing methods. To demonstrate the scalability of CBO for robotics problems, we consider three challenging trajectory optimization scenarios: (1) a long-horizon problem for a simple system, (2) a dynamic balance problem for a highly underactuated system, and (3) a high-dimensional problem with only a terminal cost. Our results show that CBO is able to achieve lower costs with respect to existing methods on all three challenging settings. This opens a new framework to study global trajectory optimization in robotics.

Abstract: Being able to simulate the outcomes of actions in varied environments will revolutionize the development of generalist agents at scale. However, modeling these world dynamics, especially for dexterous robotics tasks, poses significant challenges due to limited data coverage and scarce action labels. As an endeavor towards this end, we introduce DreamDojo, a foundation world model that learns diverse interactions and dexterous controls from 44k hours of egocentric human videos. Our data mixture represents the largest video dataset to date for world model pretraining, spanning a wide range of daily scenarios with diverse objects and skills. To address the scarcity of action labels, we introduce continuous latent actions as unified proxy actions, enhancing interaction knowledge transfer from unlabeled videos. After post-training on small-scale target robot data, DreamDojo demonstrates a strong understanding of physics and precise action controllability. We also devise a distillation pipeline that accelerates DreamDojo to a real-time speed of 10.81 FPS and further improves context consistency. Our work enables several important applications based on generative world models, including live teleoperation, policy evaluation, and model-based planning. Systematic evaluation on multiple challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks verifies the significance of our method for simulating open-world, contact-rich tasks, paving the way for general-purpose robot world models.

Abstract: This paper presents a principled framework for designing energy-aware metaheuristics that operate under fixed energy budgets. We introduce a unified operator-level model that quantifies both numerical gain and energy usage, and define a robust Expected Improvement per Joule (EI/J) score that guides adaptive selection among operator variants during the search. The resulting energy-aware solvers dynamically choose between operators to self-control exploration and exploitation, aiming to maximize fitness gain under limited energy. We instantiate this framework with three representative metaheuristics - steady-state GA, PSO, and ILS - each equipped with both lightweight and heavy operator variants. Experiments on three heterogeneous combinatorial problems (Knapsack, NK-landscapes, and Error-Correcting Codes) show that the energy-aware variants consistently reach comparable fitness while requiring substantially less energy than their non-energy-aware baselines. EI/J values stabilize early and yield clear operator-selection patterns, with each solver reliably self-identifying the most improvement-per-Joule - efficient operator across problems.

Abstract: Addressing real-world optimization challenges requires not only advanced metaheuristics but also continuous refinement of their internal mechanisms. This paper explores the integration of machine learning in the form of neural surrogate models into metaheuristics through a recent lens: energy consumption. While surrogates are widely used to reduce the computational cost of expensive objective functions, their combined impact on energy efficiency, algorithmic performance, and solution accuracy remains largely unquantified. We provide a critical investigation into this intersection, aiming to advance the design of energy-aware, surrogate-assisted search algorithms. Our experiments reveal substantial benefits: employing a state-of-the-art pre-trained surrogate can reduce energy consumption by up to 98\%, execution time by approximately 98%, and memory usage by around 99\%. Moreover, increasing the training dataset size further enhances these gains by lowering the per-use computational cost, while static pre-training versus continuous (iterative) retraining have relatively different advantages depending on whether we aim at time/energy or accuracy and general cost across problems, respectively. Surrogates also have a negative impact on costs and accuracy at times, and then they cannot be blindly adopted. These findings support a more holistic approach to surrogate-assisted optimization, integrating energy with time and predictive accuracy into performance assessments.

Abstract: Structural bias (SB) refers to systematic preferences of an optimisation algorithm for particular regions of the search space that arise independently of the objective function. While SB has been studied extensively in single-objective optimisation, its role in multi-objective optimisation remains largely unexplored. This is problematic, as dominance relations, diversity preservation and Pareto-based selection mechanisms may introduce or amplify structural effects.
  In this paper, we extend the concept of structural bias to the multi-objective setting and propose a methodology to study it in isolation from fitness-driven guidance. We introduce a suite of synthetic multi-objective test problems with analytically controlled Pareto fronts and deliberately uninformative objective values. These problems are designed to decouple algorithmic behaviour from problem structure, allowing bias induced purely by algorithmic operators and design choices to be observed. The test suite covers a range of Pareto front shapes, densities and noise levels, enabling systematic analysis of different manifestations of structural bias.
  We discuss methodological challenges specific to the multi-objective case and outline how existing SB detection approaches can be adapted. This work provides a first step towards behaviour-based benchmarking of multi-objective optimisers, complementing performance-based evaluation and informing more robust algorithm design.

Abstract: ISAC enables pervasive monitoring, but modern sensing algorithms are often too complex for energy-constrained edge devices. This motivates the development of learning techniques that balance accuracy performance and energy efficiency. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising alternative, processing information as sparse binary spike trains and potentially reducing energy consumption by orders of magnitude. In this work, we propose a spiking convolutional autoencoder (SCAE) that learns tailored spike-encoded representations of channel impulse responses (CIR), jointly trained with an SNN for human activity recognition (HAR), thereby eliminating the need for Doppler domain preprocessing. The results show that our SCAE-SNN achieves F1 scores comparable to a hybrid approach (almost 96%), while producing substantially sparser spike encoding (81.1% sparsity). We also show that encoding CIR data prior to classification improves both HAR accuracy and efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/ele-ciccia/SCAE-SNN-HAR.

Abstract: The performance gains obtained by large language models (LLMs) are closely linked to their substantial computational and memory requirements. Quantized LLMs offer significant advantages with extremely quantized models, motivating the development of specialized architectures to accelerate their workloads. This paper proposes D-Legion, a novel scalable many-core architecture, designed using many adaptive-precision systolic array cores, to accelerate matrix multiplication in quantized LLMs. The proposed architecture consists of a set of Legions where each Legion has a group of adaptive-precision systolic arrays. D-Legion supports multiple computation modes, including quantized sparse and dense matrix multiplications. The block structured sparsity is exploited within a fully-sparse, or partially-sparse windows. In addition, memory accesses of partial summations (psums) are spatially reduced through parallel accumulators. Furthermore, data reuse is maximized through optimized scheduling techniques by multicasting matrix tiles across the Legions. A comprehensive design space exploration is performed in terms of Legion/core granularity to determine the optimal Legion configuration. Moreover, D-Legion is evaluated on attention workloads from two BitNet models, delivering up to 8.2$\times$ lower latency, up to 3.8$\times$ higher memory savings, and up to 3$\times$ higher psum memory savings compared to state-of-the-art work. D-Legion, with eight Legions and 64 total cores, achieves a peak throughput of 135,68 TOPS at a frequency of 1 GHz. A scaled version of D-Legion, with 32 Legions, is compared to Google TPUv4i, achieving up to 2.5$\times$ lower total latency, up to 2.3$\times$ higher total throughput, and up to 2.7$\times$ higher total memory savings.

Abstract: The performance of n-type amorphous oxide semiconductor thin-film transistors (TFTs) is largely controlled by the density of states (DoS) near the conduction band mobility edge. Here, the full subgap DoS of amorphous InGaZnO (a-IGZO) TFTs, used in display panels and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) development, is measured by ultrabroadband photoconduction (UP-DoS) microscopy to within 0.1 eV of the mobility edge. The measured subgap DoS for 25 TFT processing conditions accurately predicts each transfer curve, showing how shallow defect states are electron traps that rigidly tune subthreshold swing, threshold voltage and drift mobility. For a set of TFTs, the subthreshold transfer characteristics can be independently simulated from the experimental shallow defect DoS, with no adjustable parameters. The full transfer curve is simulated by introducing a single parameter: the conduction band tail energy. Additionally, the simulation reveals that the shallow trap density controlling subthreshold behavior can be directly extracted from transfer curves. Finally, a systematic In-enrichment study, combined with DFT+U DoS simulations, enables identification of vacancy cation coordination environments for all experimentally observed subgap peaks. The dominant trap controlling conventional a-IGZO TFT performance is centered at ~0.32 eV below the conduction band mobility edge and is assigned to a Ga-Ga-In oxygen vacancy defect.

Abstract: Visualizations have become an indispensable part of the scientific process. A vibrant ecosystem of visualization tools exists, catering to a wide variety of different needs. Real-time visualizations of numerical simulations offer scientists immediate feedback about the status of their simulations and can also be valuable educational and outreach tools. Developing a visualization tool with support for different operating systems, CPU/GPU architectures, and programming languages can be a challenge. It is common to use one or more graphics or UI libraries to act as abstraction layers and hide the underlying complexity. Whereas external libraries greatly simplify the initial programming effort, we argue that relying on them introduces new dependencies and problems, such as a higher entry barriers for new developers and users, and uncertainty regarding long-term support. In this paper we present a new approach for real time visualizations which we have implemented for the N-body package REBOUND. We propose to use a web browser to handle GPU accelerated rendering. This enables us to offer 3D, interactive visualizations on all major operating systems. What makes our new approach unique is that we achieve this without the need for any external libraries. We utilize WebAssembly to reuse existing OpenGL visualization code. Using communication via HTTP and a custom built-in web server, we are able to provide both local and remote real time visualizations. In addition to the browser based real time visualization, our approach offers other additional operating modes, including simulations running entirely within the browser, visualizations within jupyter notebooks, and traditional standalone visualizations using OpenGL. We focus on the implementation in REBOUND but the concepts and ideas discussed can be applied to many other areas in need of scientific and non-scientific real time visualizations.

Abstract: We develop a second-order extension of intuitionistic modal logic, allowing quantification over propositions, both syntactically and semantically. A key feature of second-order logic is its capacity to define positive connectives from the negative fragment. Duly we are able to recover the diamond (and its associated theory) using only boxes, as long as we include both forward and backward modalities (`tense' modalities).
  We propose axiomatic, proof theoretic and model theoretic definitions of `second-order intuitionistic tense logic', and ultimately prove that they all coincide. In particular we establish completeness of a labelled sequent calculus via a proof search argument, yielding at the same time a cut-admissibility result. Our methodology also applies to the classical version of second-order tense logic, which we develop in tandem with the intuitionistic case.

Abstract: Realizability, introduced by Kleene, can be understood as a concretization of the Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov (BHK) interpretation of proofs, providing a framework to interpret mathematical statements and proofs in terms of their constructive or computational content. Over time, this concept has evolved through various extensions, such as Kreisel's modified realizability or Krivine's classical realizability. Parallel to these developments, Girard's work on linear logic introduced another perspective, often seen as another concrete realization of the BHK interpretation. The resulting constructions, encompassing models like geometry of interaction, ludics, and interaction graphs, were recently unified under the term linear realizability models to stress the intuitive connection with intuitionnistic and classical realizability. The present work establishes for the first time a formal link between linear realizability models and the realizability constructions of Kleene and Krivine. Our approach leverages Miquel's framework: just as linear logic can be viewed as a decomposition of intuitionistic and classical logic, we propose a linear decomposition of implicative algebras and show that linear realisability models provide concrete examples of such decompositions.

Abstract: Lewis' account of common knowledge in Convention describes the generation of higher-order expectations between agents as hinging upon agents' inductive standards and a shared witness. This paper attempts to draw from insights in learning theory to provide a formal account of common inductive knowledge and how it can be generated by a witness. Our language has a rather rich syntax in order to capture equally rich notions central to Lewis' account of common knowledge; for instance, we speak of an agent 'having some reason to believe' a proposition and one proposition 'indicating' to an agent that another proposition holds. A similar line of work was pursued by Cubitt & Sugden 2003; however, their account was left wanting for a corresponding semantics. Our syntax affords a novel topological semantics which, following Kelly 1996's approach in The Logic of Reliable Inquiry, takes as primitives agents' information bases. In particular, we endow each agent with a 'switching tolerance' meant to represent their personal inductive standards for learning. Curiously, when all agents are truly inductive learners (not choosing to believe only those propositions which are deductively verified), we show that the set of worlds where a proposition $P$ is common inductive knowledge is invariant of agents' switching tolerances. Contrarily, the question of whether a specific witness $W$ generates common inductive knowledge of $P$ is sensitive to changing agents' switching tolerances. After establishing soundness of our proof system with respect to this semantics, we conclude by applying our logic to solve an 'inductive' variant of the coordinated attack problem.

Abstract: The usual semantics of multi-agent epistemic logic is based on Kripke models, defined in terms of binary relations on a set of possible worlds. Recently, there has been a growing interest in using simplicial complexes rather than graphs, as models for multi-agent epistemic logic.
  This approach uses agents' views as the fundamental object instead of worlds. A set of views by different agents about a world forms a simplex, and a set of simplexes defines a simplicial complex, that can serve as a model for multi-agent epistemic logic. This new approach reveals topological information that is implicit in Kripke models, because the binary indistinguishability relations are more clearly seen as n-ary relations in the simplicial complex.
  This paper, written for an economics audience, introduces simplicial models to non-experts and connects distributed computing, epistemic logic and topology. Our focus is on distributed knowledge and its fixed point, common distributed knowledge. These concepts arise when considering the knowledge that a group of agents would acquire, if they could communicate their local knowledge perfectly. While common knowledge has been shown to be related to consensus, we illustrate how distributed knowledge is related to a task weaker to consensus, called majority consensus.
  We describe three models of communication, some well-known (immediate snapshot), and others less studied (related to broadcast and test-and-set). When majority consensus is solvable, we describe the distributed knowledge that is used to solve it. When it is not solvable, we present a logical obstruction, a formula that should always be known according to the task specification, but which the players cannot know.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce a problem of fairly allocating indivisible goods (items) in which the agents' valuations cannot be observed directly, but instead can only be accessed via noisy queries. In the two-agent setting with Gaussian noise and bounded valuations, we derive upper and lower bounds on the required number of queries for finding an envy-free allocation in terms of the number of items, $m$, and the negative-envy of the optimal allocation, $Δ$. In particular, when $Δ$ is not too small (namely, $Δ\gg m^{1/4}$), we establish that the optimal number of queries scales as $\frac{\sqrt m }{(Δ/ m)^2} = \frac{m^{2.5}}{Δ^2}$ up to logarithmic factors. Our upper bound is based on non-adaptive queries and a simple thresholding-based allocation algorithm that runs in polynomial time, while our lower bound holds even under adaptive queries and arbitrary computation time.

Abstract: In rank aggregation, the goal is to combine multiple input rankings into a single output ranking. In this paper, we analyze rank aggregation methods, so-called social welfare functions (SWFs), with respect to strategyproofness, which requires that no agent can misreport his ranking to obtain an output ranking that is closer to his true ranking in terms of the Kemeny distance. As our main result, we show that no anonymous SWF satisfies unanimity and strategyproofness when there are at least four alternatives. This result is proven by SAT solving, a computer-aided theorem proving technique, and verified by Isabelle, a highly trustworthy interactive proof assistant. Further, we prove by hand that strategyproofness is incompatible with majority consistency, a variant of Condorcet-consistency for SWFs. Lastly, we show that all SWFs in two natural classes have a large incentive ratio and are thus highly manipulable.

Abstract: We study selfish routing games where users can choose between regular and priority service for each network edge on their chosen path. Priority users pay an additional fee, but in turn they may travel the edge prior to non-priority users, hence experiencing potentially less congestion. For this model, we establish existence of equilibria for linear latency functions and prove uniqueness of edge latencies, despite potentially different strategic choices in equilibrium. Our main contribution demonstrates that marginal cost pricing achieves system optimality: When priority fees equal marginal externality costs, the equilibrium flow coincides with the socially optimal flow, hence the price of anarchy equals $1$. This voluntary priority mechanism therefore provides an incentive-compatible alternative to mandatory congestion pricing, whilst achieving the same result. We also discuss the limitations of a uniform pricing scheme for the priority option.

Abstract: We study the transit stop placement (TrSP) problem in general metric spaces, where agents travel between source-destination pairs and may either walk directly or utilize a shuttle service via selected transit stops. We investigate fairness in TrSP through the lens of justified representation (JR) and the core, and uncover a structural correspondence with fair clustering. Specifically, we show that a constant-factor approximation to proportional fairness in clustering can be used to guarantee a constant-factor biparameterized approximation to core. We establish a lower bound of 1.366 on the approximability of JR, and moreover show that no clustering algorithm can approximate JR within a factor better than 3. Going beyond clustering, we propose the Expanding Cost Algorithm, which achieves a tight 2.414-approximation for JR, but does not give any bounded core guarantee. In light of this, we introduce a parameterized algorithm that interpolates between these approaches, and enables a tunable trade-off between JR and core. Finally, we complement our results with an experimental analysis using small-market public carpooling data.

To address this gap, we conducted additional generalization assessments, the results of which are presented in this case study. These results serve both to complement and to refine the original analysis reported in [1]. Most importantly, the overall conclusions of the initial study remain valid: the NN is still able to reduce the PAPR level to a desired reference value, also with a lower computational cost, confirming the effectiveness and practical applicability of the proposed method across a more generalized setting.

Abstract: In reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication systems, the large-scale RIS introduces pronounced geometric effects that lead to the coexistence of far-field and near-field propagation. Furthermore, random blockages induce spatial non-stationarity across the RIS array, causing signals from different scatterers to illuminate only partial regions, referred to as visible regions (VRs). This renders conventional far-field and fully visible array-based channel models inadequate and makes channel estimation particularly challenging. In this paper, we investigate the non-stationary cascaded channel estimation problem in a hybrid-field propagation environment, where the RIS-base station (BS) link operates in the far-field, while the user-RIS link exhibits near-field characteristics with partial visibility. To address the resulting high-dimensional and coupled estimation problem, a reduced-dimensional sparse bilinear representation is developed by exploiting the structural characteristics of the cascaded channel. In particular, a dictionary compression technique is proposed to represent the high-dimensional coupled dictionary using a low-dimensional polar-domain dictionary weighted by a visibility matrix, thereby significantly reducing the problem scale. Based on this representation, a turbo-structured joint Bayesian estimation (TS-JBE) approach is proposed to simultaneously estimate the channel gains, VRs, and off-grid parameters, thereby avoiding error propagation inherent in existing sequential methods. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the estimation accuracy compared with existing approaches.

Abstract: Xona is deploying Pulsar, a low Earth orbit (LEO) commercial navigation system designed to deliver resilient positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) where traditional solutions fall short. Pulsar satellites broadcast dedicated signals optimized for commercial users. This brings rapid geometry change, strong Doppler observability, and robust timing, enabling new approaches to positioning even when only one satellite is visible. Internet of Things (IoT) applications often prioritize availability over sub-meter accuracy in urban canyons, semi-indoor spaces, and other constrained environments. Many platforms are battery-powered, have strict size, weight, and power (SWaP) limits, and cannot support complex multi-sensor architectures. Leveraging LEO dynamics and signal strength, Pulsar can maintain navigation capability under these conditions without specialized user hardware.
  Here we present a single-satellite positioning (SSP) concept that uses available Pulsar measurements to estimate user position and receiver clock states without external aiding. Early in Pulsar deployment, only one or two satellites may be in view, yet this still benefits stationary or near-stationary users, including in semi-indoor and indoor settings. We discuss algorithmic details and system implications: SSP enables positioning with minimal satellite visibility, reduces reliance on dense constellations, and supports integration into resource-constrained platforms. We present simulation and live sky results. High-fidelity constellation simulations configured for Pulsar provide controlled performance assessment. We also present early findings from a Pulsar-enabled receiver using observations from the Pulsar-0 satellite on orbit. Preliminary tests demonstrate meter-level accuracy outdoors and indoors, highlighting potential under varied reception conditions.

Abstract: This letter proposes an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS) assisted rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system to overcome the fairness bottleneck in multi-target sensing under obstructed line-of-sight environments. Beamforming at the transceiver and ARIS, along with rate splitting, are optimized to maximize the minimum multi-target echo signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio under multi-user rate and power constraints. The intricate non-convex problem is decoupled into three subproblems and solved iteratively by majorization-minimization (MM) and sequential rank-one constraint relaxation (SROCR) algorithms. Simulations show our scheme outperforms nonorthogonal multiple access, space-division multiple access, and passive RIS baselines, approaching sensing-only upper bounds.

Abstract: The computation of positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) via signal of opportunity (SOP), where signals originally transmitted for communication, such as 5G, Wi-Fi, or DVB-S, are exploited due to their ubiquity and spectral characteristics, is an emerging research field. However, relying on these signals presents challenges, including limited knowledge of the signal modulation and the need to identify recurring sequences for correlation. We offer a guide to implement a receiver capable of capturing broadband downlink Ku-band signals from low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites (e.g., Starlink and OneWeb) and estimating the recurring symbols for SOP measurements. The methodology integrates recent approaches in the literature, highlighting the most effective aspects while guiding the replication of experiments even under limitations on the front-end gain and bandwidth. Using the proposed model, we can identify recurring symbols transmitted by Starlink satellites, which are then used to collect Doppler shift measurements over a 600 s interval. A position, velocity, and time (PVT) solution is also computed via least squares (LS), which achieves a positioning error of approximately 268 m after a post-fit refinement.

Abstract: In this work, we analyze a multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surface (MF-RIS)-enabled radar and communication coexistence (RCC) system, detailing the key aspects of its phase synthesis codebook generation and the implemented localization algorithm for real-time user tracking based on density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), which features a Kalman filter for the prediction of user mobility. We derived a 3GPP-compatible radar cross-section (RCS) and re-radiation pattern-based channel model for the described MF-RIS system, supplementing it with channel measurements. We obtained large and small-scale characteristics, including path loss, shadow fading, Rician K-factor, cluster powers, and RMS delay spread. The study finds that Sub-6 GHz indoor propagation is largely free of blind spots, even with a blocked line-of-sight (LoS) path. Therefore, the proposed channel model includes non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths, including the ones created by the MF-RIS. We also performed an experimental evaluation of the channel throughput in a fifth generation (5G) new radio (NR) single user multiple-input-multiple-output (SU-MIMO) system, reporting a 74\% reduction in throughput variance and a 12.5\% sum-rate improvement within the MF-RIS near-field compared to the no-RIS setup. This result shows that the MF-RIS can minimize delay spread and increase the coherence bandwidth by creating virtual-LoS (vLoS) path for the moving user, thereby effectively hardening wireless MIMO channels.

Abstract: In the context of civilian and military communications, anti-jamming techniques are essential to ensure information integrity in the presence of malicious interference. A conventional time-domain approach relies on computing the Wiener interpolation filter to estimate and suppress the jamming waveform from the received samples. It is widely acknowledged that this method is effective for protecting wideband systems against narrowband interference. In this work, this paradigm is questioned through the design of a $K$-tone jamming waveform that is intrinsically difficult to estimate assuming a $L$-tap Wiener interpolation filter. This design relies on an optimization procedure that maximizes the analytical Bayesian mean squared error associated with the jamming waveform estimate. Additionally, an analytical proof is provided showing that a multi-tone jamming waveform composed of $L/2+1$ tones is sufficient to render the Wiener-filter-based anti-jamming module completely ineffective. The analytical results are validated through Monte Carlo simulations assuming both perfect knowledge and practical estimates of the correlation functions of the received signal.

Abstract: This paper investigates the role of large language models (LLMs) in sixth-generation (6G) Internet of Things (IoT) networks and proposes a prompt-engineering-based real-time feedback and verification (PE-RTFV) framework that perform physical-layer's optimization tasks through an iteratively process. By leveraging the naturally available closed-loop feedback inherent in wireless communication systems, PE-RTFV enables real-time physical-layer optimization without requiring model retraining. The proposed framework employs an optimization LLM (O-LLM) to generate task-specific structured prompts, which are provided to an agent LLM (A-LLM) to produce task-specific solutions. Utilizing real-time system feedback, the O-LLM iteratively refines the prompts to guide the A-LLM toward improved solutions in a gradient-descent-like optimization process. We test PE-RTFV approach on wireless-powered IoT testbed case study on user-goal-driven constellation design through semantically solving rate-energy (RE)-region optimization problem which demonstrates that PE-RTFV achieves near-genetic-algorithm performance within only a few iterations, validating its effectiveness for complex physical-layer optimization tasks in resource-constrained IoT networks.

Abstract: Large language model inference on resource constrained edge devices remains a major challenge for low latency intelligent systems, as existing solutions depend heavily on cloud or datacenter infrastructure. This work introduces QEIL, Quantifying Edge Intelligence via Inference time Scaling Laws, a unified framework for efficient local LLM inference using principled scaling laws and heterogeneous orchestration across CPU, GPU, and NPU accelerators. We derive five architecture agnostic theorems that characterize how inference efficiency scales with model size, sample budget, and device level constraints. QEIL integrates three optimization dimensions. First, inference time scaling laws show that heterogeneous workload distribution achieves superlinear efficiency gains that are not observed in homogeneous execution. Second, hardware aware routing is enabled through analytical cost models that account for compute throughput, memory bandwidth, power consumption, and thermal limits. Third, performance energy trade offs are quantified using novel metrics including Intelligence Per Watt, Energy Coverage Efficiency, and Price Power Performance. A unified orchestrator combines these components through progressive sample multiplexing to improve coverage. Extensive evaluation across five model families from 125M to 2.6B parameters demonstrates consistent gains, including 7 to 10.5 percentage point improvement in pass at k coverage, 35.6 to 78.2 percent energy reduction, 68 percent average power reduction enabling edge thermal budgets, 15.8 percent latency improvement, and zero accuracy loss. Results confirm that inference time scaling laws are universal and architecture agnostic, establishing heterogeneous edge orchestration as the optimal strategy for energy constrained intelligent systems.

Abstract: We present the first end-to-end deployment of the Gemma3 family of large language and vision models on a tiled edge dataflow architecture (AMD Ryzen AI NPU). Our work introduces a set of hardware-aware techniques. For prefill, we introduce an efficient dequantization engine, optimize tiled matrix multiplication kernels, and propose FlowQKV, a chunked, pipelined attention mechanism. For decoding, we introduce FusedDQP, which fuses dequantization and projection into a single kernel, and FlowKV, which re-structures attention to sustain high memory bandwidth utilization. Together with a compact Q4NX 4-bit quantization format, these methods yield up to $5.2\times$ faster prefill and $4.8\times$ faster decoding versus the iGPU, and $33.5\times$ and $2.2\times$ over the CPU, respectively. Power efficiency improves by as much as $67.2\times$ and $222.9\times$ compared to the iGPU and CPU. The proposed approach demonstrates that modern NPUs can deliver practical, low-power LLM and VLM inference at the edge, and provides a generalizable blueprint for mapping transformer-based models onto tiled dataflow accelerators.

Abstract: Scheduling precedence-constrained tasks under shared renewable resources is central to modern computing platforms. The Resource Investment Problem (RIP) models this setting by minimizing the cost of provisioned renewable resources under precedence and timing constraints. Exact mixed-integer programming and constraint programming become impractically slow on large instances, and dynamic updates require schedule revisions under tight latency budgets. We present iScheduler, a reinforcement-learning-driven iterative scheduling framework that formulates RIP solving as a Markov decision process over decomposed subproblems and constructs schedules through sequential process selection. The framework accelerates optimization and supports reconfiguration by reusing unchanged process schedules and rescheduling only affected processes. We also release L-RIPLIB, an industrial-scale benchmark derived from cloud-platform workloads with 1,000 instances of 2,500-10,000 tasks. Experiments show that iScheduler attains competitive resource costs while reducing time to feasibility by up to 43$\times$ against strong commercial baselines.

Abstract: The escalating demand for high-fidelity, real-time inference in distributed edge-cloud environments necessitates aggressive model optimization to counteract severe latency and energy constraints. This paper introduces the Hybrid Quantization and Pruning (HQP) framework, a novel, integrated methodology designed to achieve synergistic model acceleration while adhering to strict quality guarantees. We detail a sensitivity-aware structural pruning algorithm that employs a dynamic weight sensitivity metric, derived from a highly efficient approximation of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), to guide the iterative removal of redundant filters. This pruning is strictly conditional, enforcing an adherence to a maximum permissible accuracy drop (Delta ax) before the model proceeds to 8-bit post-training quantization. This rigorous coordination is critical, as it ensures the resultant sparse model structure is maximally robust to quantization error and hardware-specific kernel optimization. Exhaustive evaluation across heterogeneous NVIDIA Jetson edge platforms, utilizing resource-efficient architectures like MobileNetV3 and ResNet-18, demonstrates that the HQP framework achieves a peak performance gain of 3.12 times inference speedup and a 55 percent model size reduction, while rigorously containing the accuracy drop below the 1.5 percent constraint. A comprehensive comparative analysis against conventional single-objective compression techniques validates the HQP framework as a superior, hardware-agnostic solution for deploying ultra-low-latency AI in resource-limited edge infrastructures.

We propose CL-colME, a novel variant utilizing Laplacian-based consensus to avoid the computationally expensive normalization processes. Simulation results show that the proposed CL-colME maintains the convergence behavior and accuracy of C-colME while improving computational efficiency.

Abstract: Sparse sketches such as the sparse Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform are a core primitive in randomized numerical linear algebra because they leverage random sparsity to reduce the arithmetic cost of sketching, while still offering strong approximation guarantees. Their random sparsity, however, is at odds with efficient implementations on modern GPUs, since it leads to irregular memory access patterns that degrade memory bandwidth utilization. Motivated by this tension, we pursue a sketch-kernel co-design approach: we design a new family of sparse sketches, BlockPerm-SJLT, whose sparsity structure is chosen to enable FlashSketch, a corresponding optimized CUDA kernel that implements these sketches efficiently. The design of BlockPerm-SJLT introduces a tunable parameter that explicitly trades off the tension between GPU-efficiency and sketching robustness. We provide theoretical guarantees for BlockPerm-SJLT under the oblivious subspace embedding (OSE) framework, and also analyze the effect of the tunable parameter on sketching quality. We empirically evaluate FlashSketch on standard RandNLA benchmarks, as well as an end-to-end ML data attribution pipeline called GraSS. FlashSketch pushes the Pareto frontier of sketching quality versus speed, across a range of regimes and tasks, and achieves a global geomean speedup of roughly 1.7x over the prior state-of-the-art GPU sketches.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Attention efficiency is critical to large language model (LLM) inference. While prior advances optimize attention execution for individual requests (e.g., FlashAttention), production LLM serving relies on batching requests with highly heterogeneous sequence lengths for high serving throughput. This mismatch induces severe computation and I/O imbalance, exacerbates stragglers, and underutilizes GPU resources. We present PackInfer, a kernel-level attention framework that enables compute- and I/O-aware execution for heterogeneous batched inference. PackInfer orchestrates batched requests into load-balanced execution groups, effectively saturating GPU utilization by packing multiple requests into unified kernel launches. By constructing attention kernels directly over packed query-key regions, PackInfer eliminates redundant computation and balances thread-block execution. It then incorporates I/O-aware grouping that co-locates shared-prefix requests and reorganizes KV caches into group-contiguous layouts, reducing memory fragmentation and redundant data movement as generation evolves. Evaluations on real-world workloads show that PackInfer reduces inference latency by 13.0-20.1%, and improves throughput by 20% compared to the state-of-the-art FlashAttention.

Abstract: Performance in web applications is a key aspect of user experience and system scalability. Among the different techniques used to improve web application performance, caching has been widely used. While caching has been widely explored in web performance optimization literature, there is a lack of experimental work that explores the effect of simple inmemory caching in small-scale web applications. This paper fills this research gap by experimentally comparing the performance of two server-side web application configurations: one without caching and another with in-memory caching and a fixed time-tolive. The performance evaluation was conducted using a lightweight web server framework, and response times were measured using repeated HTTP requests under identical environmental conditions. The results show a significant reduction in response time for cached requests, and the findings of this paper provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of simple server-side caching in improving web application performance making it suitable for educational environments and small-scale web applications where simplicity and reproducibility are critical.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) drives interest in matrix-based optimizers (e.g., Shampoo, Muon, SOAP) for their convergence efficiency; yet their requirement for holistic updates conflicts with the tensor fragmentation in distributed frameworks like Megatron. Existing solutions are suboptimal: synchronous approaches suffer from computational redundancy, while layer-wise partitioning fails to reconcile this conflict without violating the geometric constraints of efficient communication primitives. To bridge this gap, we propose Canzona, a Unified, Asynchronous, and Load-Balanced framework that decouples logical optimizer assignment from physical parameter distribution. For Data Parallelism, we introduce an alpha-Balanced Static Partitioning strategy that respects atomicity while neutralizing the load imbalance. For Tensor Parallelism, we design an Asynchronous Compute pipeline utilizing Micro-Group Scheduling to batch fragmented updates and hide reconstruction overhead. Extensive evaluations on the Qwen3 model family (up to 32B parameters) on 256 GPUs demonstrate that our approach preserves the efficiency of established parallel architectures, achieving a 1.57x speedup in end-to-end iteration time and reducing optimizer step latency by 5.8x compared to the baseline.

Abstract: FPGAs offer high performance, low latency, and energy efficiency for accelerated computing, yet adoption in scientific and edge settings is limited by the specialized hardware expertise required. High-level synthesis (HLS) boosts productivity over HDLs, but competitive designs still demand hardware-aware optimizations and careful dataflow design. We introduce LAAFD, an agentic workflow that uses large language models to translate general-purpose C++ into optimized Vitis HLS kernels. LAAFD automates key transfor mations: deep pipelining, vectorization, and dataflow partitioning and closes the loop with HLS co-simulation and synthesis feedback to verify correctness while iteratively improving execution time in cycles. Over a suite of 15 kernels representing common compute patterns in HPC, LAFFD achieves 99.9% geomean performance when compared to the hand tuned baseline for Vitis HLS. For stencil workloads, LAAFD matches the performance of SODA, a state-of-the-art DSL-based HLS code generator for stencil solvers, while yielding more readable kernels. These results suggest LAAFD substantially lowers the expertise barrier to FPGA acceleration without sacrificing efficiency.

Abstract: In Federated Learning (FL), multiple parties collaboratively train a shared Machine Learning model to encapsulate all private knowledge without exchange of information. While it has seen application in several industrial projects, most FL research considers simulations on a central machine, without considering potential hardware heterogeneity between the involved parties. In this paper, we present BouquetFL, a framework designed to address this methodological gap by simulating heterogeneous client hardware on a single physical machine. By programmatically emulating diverse hardware configurations through resource restriction, BouquetFL enables controlled FL experimentation under realistic hardware diversity. Our tool provides an accessible way to study system heterogeneity in FL without requiring multiple physical devices, thereby bringing experimental practice closer to practical deployment conditions. The target audience are FL researchers studying highly heterogeneous federations. We include a wide range of profiles derived from commonly available consumer and small-lab devices, as well as a custom hardware sampler built on real-world hardware popularity, allowing users to configure the federation according to their preference.

Abstract: Training billion-parameter models requires distributing model states across GPUs using fully sharded data parallel (i.e., ZeRO-3). While ZeRO-3 succeeds on clusters with high-bandwidth NVLink and InfiniBand interconnects, researchers with commodity hardware face severe inter-node all-gather bottlenecks. Existing optimizations take two approaches: GPU memory caching (MiCS, ZeRO++) trades memory capacity for reduced communication, triggering out-of-memory failures on large models; host memory offloading (ZeRO-Offload, ZeRO-Infinity) extends capacity but degrades throughput due to PCIe overhead. We observe that on bandwidth-limited clusters, host memory can serve not as an overflow tier but as a fast caching layer that outperforms inter-node communication. Based on this insight, we propose FCDP, which eliminates redundant inter-node communication while preserving ZeRO-3's minimal GPU memory footprint. FCDP caches forward-pass parameters in host memory and reuses them during the backward pass via fast intra-node all-gather, reducing inter-node all-gather by 50%. For parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), FCDP selectively communicates only trainable parameters to maximize caching, reducing inter-node traffic by over 99%. In our commodity cluster setup, FCDP achieves up to 100x higher throughput than ZeRO-3 and 51x higher than ZeRO++, while maintaining ZeRO-3's maximum batch size.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In LLM serving, reusing the KV cache of prompts across requests is critical for reducing TTFT and serving costs. Cache-affinity scheduling, which co-locates requests with the same prompt prefix to maximize KV cache reuse, often conflicts with load-balancing scheduling that distributes requests evenly across compute instances. Existing schedulers fail to reconcile this trade-off as they operate within a single mapping space, typically applying cache-affinity routing to a subset of requests and load-balanced routing to the rest, without a unified solution to achieve both goals. To address this limitation, we propose DualMap, a dual-mapping scheduling strategy for distributed LLM serving that achieves both cache affinity and load balancing. Its key idea is to map each request to two candidate instances via two independent hash functions based on the request prompt, then intelligently select the better candidate based on current system states. This design increases the likelihood that requests with shared prefixes are co-located, while evenly dispersing distinct prefixes across the cluster via ``the power of two choices''. To make DualMap robust under dynamic and skewed real-world workloads, we incorporate three techniques: 1) SLO-aware request routing, which prioritizes cache affinity but switches to load-aware scheduling when TTFT exceeds the SLO, enhancing load balance without sacrificing cache reuse; 2) hotspot-aware rebalancing, which dynamically migrates requests from overloaded to underloaded instances, mitigating hotspots and rebalancing the system; 3) lightweight dual-hash-ring scaling, which leverages a dual-hash-ring mapping to support fast and low-overhead instance scaling without costly global remapping. Experiments on real-world workloads show that DualMap improves effective request capacity by up to 2.25$\times$ under the same TTFT SLO constraints compared with SOTA work.

Abstract: We present a framework for dynamic management of structured parallel processing skeletons on serverless platforms. Our goal is to bring HPC-like performance and resilience to serverless and continuum environments while preserving the programmability benefits of skeletons. As a first step, we focus on the well known Farm pattern and its implementation on the open-source OpenFaaS platform, treating autoscaling of the worker pool as a QoS-aware resource management problem. The framework couples a reusable farm template with a Gymnasium-based monitoring and control layer that exposes queue, timing, and QoS metrics to both reactive and learning-based controllers. We investigate the effectiveness of AI-driven dynamic scaling for managing the farm's degree of parallelism via the scalability of serverless functions on OpenFaaS. In particular, we discuss the autoscaling model and its training, and evaluate two reinforcement learning (RL) policies against a baseline of reactive management derived from a simple farm performance model. Our results show that AI-based management can better accommodate platform-specific limitations than purely model-based performance steering, improving QoS while maintaining efficient resource usage and stable scaling behaviour.

Abstract: We show that periodic honeycomb networks of ballistic conducting channels generically host exact flat bands spanning the entire Brillouin zone. These flat bands are independent of microscopic vertex scattering, persist for any number of transverse modes, and occur in a universal $1\colon 2$ ratio with dispersive bands. Their existence is enforced by local $D_3$ vertex symmetry and lattice translations. We construct compact localized states obeying a Bohr-Sommerfeld-type quantization condition and demonstrate that flat bands survive in realistic antidot lattices, establishing honeycomb wire networks as a robust flat band platform relevant to gated high-mobility 2D electron gases and molecule-patterned metallic surfaces.

Abstract: In this work we present a cavity-enhanced InAs/$\mathrm{In_{0.53}Al_{0.23}Ga_{0.24}As}$ quantum dot (QD) single-photon source in the telecom C-band with a record-low biexciton emitter decay time of \SI{67.4(2)}{ps} under resonant two-photon excitation (TPE). We observe strong multiphoton suppression associated with $g^{(2)}_\mathrm{X}(0) = 0.006(1)$ and $g^{(2)}_\mathrm{XX}(0) = 0.007(1)$ for the exciton (X) and biexciton (XX) emission, respectively. Due to a asymmetric Purcell enhancement of the XX-X cascade, the two-photon interference (TPI) visibility of XX photons under $π$-pulse excitation of $V_{\rm{TPI}} = 90(3)\%$ reaches the theoretical limit and clearly exceeds the $\sim60\%$ expected for standard XX-X cascades without photonic engineering. Furthermore, adding a second timed laser pulse coinciding with XX emission energy, we demonstrate stimulated TPE in the telecom C-Band. The result is an improved TPI visibility of the X photons of $V_{\rm{TPI}}=0.69(3)$ compared to TPE with $V_{\rm{TPI}}=0.61(4)$, with both being reduced compared to the theoretical values due to present dephasing effects. The advances presented in this work hold important promises for the implementation of advanced schemes of quantum communication using deterministic quantum light sources.

Abstract: We investigate the two-port scattering process in non-Hermitian dimer models via quantum measurements using external leads. We focus on two exemplary dimer models that preserve parity-time symmetry via spatial gain-loss balance and exhibit non-reciprocity due to directional hopping. The scattering matrix is constructed using the biorthogonality of the left and right scattering states of the Hamiltonian, allowing us to calculate the reflection and transmission probabilities. Our analysis compares the reflection and transmission coefficients derived from the left, right, and combined scattering states, revealing that, unlike in Hermitian systems, the non-Hermitian scattering process does not adhere to unitarity when considering only the right scattering states. Furthermore, non-Hermitian scattering can enhance the reflection and transmission probabilities, with distinct physical contributions arising independently from complex eigenvalues and the non-orthogonality of eigenstates. Our results clarify how biorthogonality restores generalized unitarity and identify distinct physical origins of enhanced transport in PT-symmetric and non-reciprocal dimers, providing new insights into quantum transport in non-Hermitian systems.

Abstract: We investigate the effects of chirality on phonon thermal transport in semiconducting chiral single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) using lattice dynamics combined with Boltzmann transport theory. We find that transverse acoustic and optical phonon modes, which are degenerate in nonchiral zigzag and armchair SWCNTs, are split in chiral SWCNTs, giving rise to finite phonon angular momentum associated with circular motion of individual atoms. This angular momentum is most efficiently generated in small-diameter nanotubes with intermediate chiral angles. Consequently, chiral SWCNTs are predicted to undergo thermally induced rigid-body rotation with an experimentally observable angular velocity via the thermal Einstein-de Haas effect.

Abstract: Wavefront dislocations (WDs) -- phase singularities observed in quasiparticle interference (QPI) experiments -- have been widely interpreted as the definitive real-space signatures of Berry phases in graphene-family systems. Here, we disentangle the roles of topological charge and pseudospin texture in WD experiments. By investigating various way of the annihilation of quadratic band touchings (QBTs) in bilayer graphene and magneto-spin-orbit graphene systems, we demonstrate that WD evolution is governed exclusively by changes in the underlying pseudospin winding, while remaining insensitive to the topological charge (i.e., vorticity) of the band touching itself. Our results imply that WD measures wavefunction pseudospin texture rather than a diagnostic of topological charge and provide solid-state platforms in which WD evolution can be engineered and observed.

Abstract: We theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate optically tunable nonlinear mechanical damping in a cavity optomechanical system utilizing a partly resolved sideband regime. Optomechanical coupling provides a delayed nonlinear backaction to the mechanical modes, resulting in nonlinear mechanical damping. This optically induced nonlinear damping is observed in the frequency and time domains, and we show using both theory and experiment that it can be tuned via laser detuning. We also observe optically mediated cross-nonlinear damping between two mechanical modes: the amplitude of one mode modulates the damping of the other. The presented results show a fully tunable scheme of nonlinear mechanical damping that will be applicable to various non-trivial systems, governed by nonlinear, nonequilibrium, and non-Hermitian phenomena.

Abstract: Twisted bilayers, featuring interfacial ferroelectricity in the form of array of polar domains, combined with incommensurate two-dimensional layers in a single van der Waals heterostructures allows for generation of purely electrostatic moiré superlattice potentials in the latter. We study electronic and optoelectronic properties of such heterostructures composed of graphene stacked with the twisted ferroelectric bilayers and show that doping of graphene substantially affects mini-band structures because of screening of free carriers. We demonstrate that formation of van Hove singularities in density of states modifies linear and second-order responses of the structures leading to resonant absorption and linear photovoltaic effect, respectively. The latter is generated solely by a shift photocurrent, arising only with account of virtual optical transitions, whereas an injection photocurrent is forbidden by symmetry.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate spin-valley-locked tunneling transport in a transition-metal dichalcogenide/ferromagnetic-insulator heterostructure under a perpendicular magnetic field, driven by the spin Seebeck effect. We demonstrate that spin-valley coupling together with the magnetic-field-induced valley-asymmetric Landau-level structure enables the generation of a valley-polarized spin current from valley-selective spin excitation. We compare the spin current and the valley-polarized spin current in the conduction and valence bands and clarify their distinct microscopic origins. We predict pronounced quantum oscillations of the valley-polarized spin current, providing a clear experimental signature of quantized valley states.

Abstract: The emergence of the terahertz (THz) ratchet effect is a rapidly expanding field of research that utilizes broken spatial symmetry in low-dimensional materials to rectify alternating current (AC) induced by THz fields into direct current (DC). This mechanism is highly promising for next-generation, room-temperature terahertz applications, particularly in high-speed, sensitive detection and imaging. In this work, we explore a ratchet effect generated in two dimensional tellurene, a novel promising semiconductor material consisting of helical atomic chains, creating a structure with inherent chirality. As a key result, the DC circular ratchet current flowing in the chiral axis direction $c$ is determined by the helicity of the radiation and can be reversed by switching the helicity from right to left handed. The circular ratchet effect excited by THz laser radiation is demonstrated for room temperature. The effect is demonstrated at various gate voltages when the Fermi level lies in vicinity of the Weyl point in the conduction band, in the band gap, and in the valence band with almost parabolic energy dispersion. The results are described by the developed microscopic theory based on the Boltzmann kinetic equation approach.

Abstract: We study Andreev-mediated transport and current fluctuations in interacting normal-superconducting quantum-dot systems. Using a generalized master equation based on real-time diagrammatics and full counting statistics, we compute the steady-state current, zero-frequency noise, and rate of entropy production in the large superconducting-gap limit. We show how Coulomb interactions modify Andreev-mediated transport by renormalizing resonant conditions and suppressing superconducting coherence, leading to a pronounced reduction of current precision even when average currents are only weakly affected. These effects are particularly evident at high temperatures, where conventional Coulomb-blockade features are thermally smeared while fluctuation properties remain highly sensitive. By analyzing thermodynamic uncertainty relations, we demonstrate that violations of the quantum bound present in the noninteracting regime are progressively reduced and eventually suppressed as interactions increase, whereas the recently proposed hybrid bound remains satisfied. Our results clarify how Coulomb interactions, and nonequilibrium fluctuations jointly determine transport properties in hybrid superconducting devices, and establish current precision as a robust benchmark for interacting Andreev transport beyond the noninteracting limit.

Abstract: We present a temperature-dependent extension of the approximate electronic conductivity formula of Hindley and Mott that leverages time-averaged fluctuations of the electronic density of states obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics. By thermally averaging the square of the density of states near the Fermi level, we obtain an estimate of the temperature dependence of the conductivity. This approach termed the thermally-averaged Hindley-Mott (TAHM) method was applied to five representative systems: crystalline aluminum (c-Al), aluminum with a grain boundary (AlGB), a four-layer graphene-aluminum composite (Al-Gr), amorphous silicon (a-Si) and amorphous germanium-antimony-telluride (a-GST). The method reproduces the expected Bloch-Gruneisen decrease in conductivity for c-Al and AlGB. Generally, the reduction (increase) in conductivity for metallic (semiconducting) materials are reproduced. It captures microstructure-induced, thermally activated conduction in multilayer Al-Gr, a-Si and a-GST. Overall, the approach provides a computationally efficient link between time-dependent electronic structure and temperature-dependent transport, offering a simple and approximate tool for exploring electronic conductivity trends in complex and disordered materials.

Abstract: We investigate the non-thermal material dynamics of strongly excited silicon during ultra-fast laser ablation. In contrast to metals, silicon shows strongly excitation-dependent interatomic bonding strengths, which gives rise to a number of unique material dynamics like non-thermal melting, Coulomb explosions and altered carrier heat conduction due to charge carrier confinement. In this study, we report novel non-thermal ablation mechanisms in the ultra-fast single shot laser ablation of silicon and perform large scale massive multi-parallel simulations on experimentally achievable length scales with atomistic resolution. For this, we model the ultra-fast carrier dynamics utilizing the Thermal-Spike-Model coupled to Molecular Dynamics simulations and include the accompanied excitation-dependent nonthermal bonding strength manipulation by application of the excitation-dependent modified Tersoff Potential. Further, we present first results on the systematic construction of the excitation-dependent phase diagram of silicon by thermodynamic integration.

Abstract: Altermagnets are a promising class of materials for spintronic applications. However, compounds that simultaneously combine the symmetry required to support an anomalous Hall effect with good metallic conductivity and magnetic ordering temperatures well above room temperature remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that partial substitution of Cr by Mn in epitaxial CrSb(100) thin films provides a viable route to engineer the combined structural and magnetic symmetry necessary to enable an otherwise symmetry-forbidden anomalous Hall effect. By systematically exploring the magnetic phase diagram Cr$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$Sb thin films, we identify a pronounced anomalous Hall effect in Cr$_{0.75}$Mn$_{0.25}$Sb. Guided by Landau theory, we model the field-driven reorientation of the Néel vector and the resulting anomalous Hall response, achieving good qualitative agreement with the experimental observations.

We demonstrate a temperature-driven transition from screw- to edge-dislocation-controlled deformation in a single-phase NbTaTiV RCCA. Tensile tests from 298-1573 K reveal a pronounced intermediate-temperature strength plateau and yield strengths surpassing other ductile RCCAs and the Ni-based superalloy CMSX-4 above 1273 K. In-situ neutron diffraction, TEM, and molecular dynamics identify a crossover near ~900 K, where edge dislocation glide stabilized by V-induced lattice distortion dominates, enabling enhanced strength retention and a clear design strategy for ultrahigh-temperature applications.

Abstract: Transition-metal nitrides in η-carbide type structures exhibit unusual bonding motifs and proximity to magnetic instabilities. Yet they remain unexplored in thin-film form due to the difficulty of stabilizing nitrogen-poor ternaries among competing phases. Here, we report the thin-film synthesis and phase-stability mapping of the η-nitride systems Fe-W-N and Fe-Mo-N. Amorphous Fe-M-N (M = W, Mo) combinatorial libraries deposited by reactive co-sputtering crystallize upon rapid thermal annealing, enabling systematic identification of synthesis windows as a function of composition and annealing temperature. Using laboratory powder X-ray diffraction and synchrotron grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering, we establish that Fe3Mo3N-based η-carbide phases form over a substantially broader compositional and thermal range than W-based compositions, where η-structures are stabilized only when the films are Fe-rich. These trends are rationalized using mixed chemical-potential vs. composition phase diagrams that capture the narrow nitrogen chemical-potential stability of η-nitrides. Magnetic measurements reveal that ferromagnetism is induced in Fe-rich Fe3.54Mo2.46N with a small exchange-bias-like response that is absent in Fe3W3N-based compositions, highlighting the sensitivity of magnetic behavior to modest deviations from stoichiometry. This work establishes practical thin-film synthesis routes for η-nitride materials and demonstrates how composition can be tuned to access emergent magnetic phenomena in these complex nitrides.

Abstract: We report detailed Raman spectroscopic and magnetic susceptibility studies on the spin-driven ferroelectric compounds Mn4Nb2O9 (MNO) and Mn4Ta2O9 (MTO). Both systems exhibit strong spin-phonon coupling below the short-range magnetic ordering temperature (T(sro)=223 K), followed by further renormalization of several Raman modes at the long-range magnetic ordering temperatures (TN = 120 K for MNO and 110 K for MTO). Pronounced anomalies in Raman mode frequencies and linewidths, along with the emergence of octahedral modes between Tsro and TN, indicate a possible low-symmetry structural transition, more evident in MNO and closely linked to magnetic ordering in MTO. Distinct low-temperature evolutions of Raman mode shift, linewidth, and integrated intensity in MNO and MTO highlight the role of the nonmagnetic B-site cation in tuning spin-lattice coupling, driven by differences in spin-orbit coupling and orbital hybridization between Nb5+ (4d) and Ta5+ (5d). By combining Raman spectroscopy with nuclear magnetic resonance, and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, we further show that Mn-based systems possess a more distorted local structure than their Co analogues, while their electronic structures differ despite comparable band gaps. These results provide a comprehensive understanding of spin-lattice coupling in Mn- and Co-based A4B2O9 magnetoelectric systems.

Abstract: Twisted transition-metal dichalcogenides host highly tunable moiré potentials, flat bands, and correlated electronic phases, yet the role of disorder in shaping these emergent properties remains largely unresolved. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we investigate the impact of electrostatic disorder on the electronic structure of marginally twisted ($θ\approx 0.95^\circ$) bilayer MoS$_2$. Differences of 15 meV in the onset energies of the valence and conduction bands between MX- and XM-stacked regions are observed and are unexpected based on symmetry considerations. We further observe spatially correlated disorder in the band onset energy that is consistent with a background random charge density of a few $10^{11}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. Continuum model calculations for twisted MoS$_2$ reveal dramatic changes in the low-energy moiré bands in response to an electric displacement field, in quantitative agreement with experiment. Moreover, the calculated local density of states including disorder broadening reproduces the experimental observations only when structural relaxation is taken into account. These results highlight the critical role of electrostatic disorder in determining the electronic structure of moiré materials at the nanoscale.

Abstract: Antiperovskites share the same structure as perovskites, but allow completely different chemistries and nominal charge states of anions to be stabilized. This gives rise to many interesting phenomena, including septet superconductivity and topological crystalline insulating phases in these systems. Despite this, the work on the crystal structural trends in these compounds are more limited compared to perovskites. In this study, we consider the family of antiperovskite oxides with tetrel elements (Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) and alkaline earth metals (Ca, Sr, Ba), and perform a detailed study of their crystal structures using first principles density functional theory. We show how tolerance factor arguments can be constructed to predict their structure in a way parallel to the perovskites, and furthermore, how heterostructuring (or cation-order) can be used to induce ferroelectricity in these systems which may provide an experimental knob to modify electronic structure. We conclude by a discussion of the electronic structure of antiperovskites, and show that they display interesting trends not observed in regular perovskites, including significant antibonding interactions between face-center ions, which might need to be taken into account building effective electronic models of these compounds.

Abstract: Antiferromagnetic kagome metal FeGe has attracted tremendous attention in condensed matter physics due to the charge density wave (CDW) being well below its magnetic transition temperature. Up to now, numerous works on kagome FeGe have been based on single crystal bulk, but its thin film form has still not been reported. Here, we achieved epitaxial growth of FeGe thin films on Al2O3 substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. Structural characterization with x-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals single phase with flat surface of kagome FeGe thin films. Moreover, a Néel temperature of 397 K and a rapid variation of Hall coefficient and magnetoresistance around 100 K, which might be related to the CDW, were revealed via transport measurements. The high quality kagome FeGe thin films are expected to provide a versatile platform to study the mechanism of CDW and explore the application of FeGe in antiferromagnetic spintronics.

Abstract: Vacancy-ordered halide double perovskites Cs$_2BX_6$ have recently attracted significant attention due to their intrinsically ultralow lattice thermal conductivity ($κ_{\mathrm{L}}$), which is highly desirable for thermal insulation and thermoelectric applications. In this work, we systematically investigate the anharmonic lattice dynamics and thermal transport properties of Cs$_2BX_6$ ($B$ = Zr, Pd, Sn, Te, Hf, and Pt; $X$ = Cl, Br, and I) using state-of-the-art first-principles calculations, based on a unified theory of thermal transport for crystals and glasses. All studied compounds are found to exhibit ultralow $κ_{\mathrm{L}}$ below 1.0~W\,m$^{-1}$\,K$^{-1}$ at room temperature and large derivation from the conventional $T^{-1}$ temperature dependence. Our analysis combining with machine-learning approach show that low sound velocities (1100 -- 1600~m\,s$^{-1}$), which originates from the intrinsically weak chemical bonding, play a crucial role in suppressing heat transport of the most compounds, instead of the strong scattering of rattling phonon modes expected from the large void in the structure. Furthermore, the influence of $B$ and $X$-site elements on phonon dispersion, anharmonicity, and scattering phase space is clarified. Our results provide microscopic insights into the origin of ultralow $κ_{\mathrm{L}}$ in Cs$_2BX_6$ and offer guiding principles for the rational design of halide-based materials with tailored thermal transport properties.

In this paper, a praseodymium-ion doped $Lu_2S_3$ single crystal grown by micro-pulling down technique is investigated with focus on its spectroscopic properties. The Raman, excitation, and luminescence spectra are presented. By selective excitation of the main energy levels of $Pr^{3+}$-ions, 26 luminescence transitions of the $Pr:Lu_2S_3$ crystal spanning the 0.49 to 5.5 $μ$m wavelength range have been identified. The correct assignment of the observed luminescence spectra to the respective $Pr^{3+}$ energy-level transitions was confirmed by the calculation of the optimized squared reduced-matrix elements for the tensor operators U(k) and L + gS.

Abstract: In this study, we report on the growth of ternary caesium lithium iodide ($Cs_2Li_3I_5$, CLI) bulk crystals, both undoped and doped with thallium (Tl) and indium (In), using the miniaturised vertical Bridgman method (mVB). X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD) confirmed the presence of the ternary CLI phase in all three crystals, with CLI : In appearing homogeneous structure-wise throughout the entire ingot. Measurements of radioluminescence (RL), photoluminescence emission (PL), photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra, and photoluminescence decay kinetics (PL decay) demonstrated that the primary luminescence centers originate from the matrix itself. When doped with thallium, the efficiency of the luminescence was significantly increased. Furthermore, CLI : Tl and CLI : In crystals exhibited emission spectra similar to those of their doped caesium iodide counterparts, CsI : Tl and CsI : In, respectively. The main component of the PL decay was 523 ns, 557 ns, and 554 ns for the undoped, Tl+-doped, and In+-doped crystals, respectively. It is worthy of note that only CLI : Tl exhibited a single exponential decay. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measurements revealed two endothermic peaks corresponding to the eutectic and liquidus temperature for CLI and CLI : In, indicating that this ternary compound has a congruent melting behaviour. Finally, the melting point of CLI was estimated to be approximately 220 °C.

Abstract: In recent years, hybrid organic-inorganic metal halides have been at the forefront of materials research. Typically, the functional (e.g., optoelectronic) properties of hybrid halides are derived from the inorganic structural part, whereas the organic structural units can add extra advantages in terms of stability, rigidity, and processability. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of two new hybrid materials in which the outstanding photophysical properties originate from the organic structural part. The new compounds, (C15H16N)2CdCl4 and ((Br)C15H15N)2CdCl4, have 2D layered Ruddlesden-Poppertype perovskite structures. These hybrids are blue-white light emitters just like their corresponding pure organic salts, but with much improved emission efficiencies. Optical spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) studies confirm that photoemission comes from the trans-stilbene organic cations. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) values of these new materials are among the highest known, 50.83 % and 26.60 % for (C15H16N)2CdCl4 and ((Br)C15H15N)2CdCl4, respectively. This is up to a 5-fold increase as compared to the light emission efficiency of the precursor salt C15H16NCl (PLQY of 10.33 %). Alongside their outstanding optical properties, their environmental and thermal stability allow their consideration for potential practical applications such as radiation detection. This work shows that hybrid metal halides can be compositionally and structurally engineered to have highly efficient photoemission originating from the organic components for fast scintillation applications.

Abstract: Ion implantation is a powerful approach for tuning the electrical properties of materials through controlled doping and defect engineering, with applications in thermoelectrics and microelectronics. Scandium nitride (ScN) is particularly sensitive to irradiation-induced disorder, with transport properties spanning several orders of magnitude and multiple conduction mechanisms involved. In this study, we investigate the evolution of electrical transport in epitaxial ScN thin films undergoing accumulated irradiation damage at an initial defect state. A phenomenological damage-accumulation model was successfully combined with temperature dependent resistivity and Hall effect measurements to elucidate the impact of defect buildup on electrical transport and to provide physically grounded, quantitative insight into the nature and accumulation of irradiation-induced defects. It reveals two distinct defects-generation regimes of electrically active defects. At low doses, direct-impact damage produces stable and isolated acceptor-type complex defects, (VSc-X) with VSc a scandium vacancy and X denoting residual impurities, leading to a gradual increase in resistivity. At higher doses, defect accumulation dominates through a multi-hit process, giving rise to point-defect buildup and carrier localization, resulting in hopping-dominated transport. This localized regime is thermally unstable and recovers upon low-temperature annealing. We further demonstrate that the residual defect landscape strongly influences both the critical dose for the metal-insulator transition and the localization strength: films grown on Al2O3 exhibit an earlier transition and weaker localization than those grown on MgO. These results highlight ion implantation as an effective route for engineering disorder-induced localization in ScN, with the initial film quality playing a decisive role.

Abstract: We propose a set of optomagnonic logic elements based on the effect of optical magnetization switching via the non-thermal inverse Faraday effect induced by femtosecond laser pulses in nearly compensated iron-garnet film with uniaxial anisotropy. Two equilibrium states in such a film are separated by a potential barrier that might be overpassed if the femtosecond pulse fluence exceeds a threshold value, so that magnetization is reversed after the pulse action. The switching threshold depends strongly on the value of applied in-plane external magnetic field, and is different for the two initial magnetization states and two opposite optical pulse helicites. This makes it possible to perform optomagnonic non-thermal deterministic writing of a magnetic bit. Such switching mechanism can be used for realizing reconfigurable optomagnonic logic elements without thermal assistance. Logical operations are implemented by encoding inputs in the amplitude and helicity of the optical pulses, while outputs are written as the magnetization state. The study demonstrates a pathway towards heating-free optomagnonic logic and memory devices.

Abstract: Cs$_2$KInI$_6$ is a promising lead-free halide double perovskite with a calculated direct band gap of 1.24 eV, ideal for solar cell applications. Our first-principles calculations reveal that its cubic phase (Fm$\bar{3}$m) is dynamically unstable. Using an accelerated machine learning approach, we identify 42 dynamically stable structures and further validate these findings using first principles calculations on 11 of these. The most stable phase has Cmc$2_1$ symmetry with 20 atoms/unit cell. It lies 41.9 meV/atom below the cubic reference but lacks octahedral cation coordination. The most stable perovskite-like structure has P$\bar{3}$ symmetry with 10 atoms/unit cell and low octahedral connectivity. Structure-property trade-offs are highlighted, with calculated distortions generally widening the band gap, shifting it from direct to indirect, and flattening the band edges. This work showcases the synergy of genetic algorithms, machine-learned potentials, and first-principles validation for discovering stable, complex materials.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) remains expensive, particularly because the rollout is expensive. Decoupling rollout generation from policy optimization (e.g., leveraging a more efficient model to rollout) could enable substantial efficiency gains, yet doing so introduces a severe distribution mismatch that destabilizes learning. We propose Jackpot, a framework that leverages Optimal Budget Rejection Sampling (OBRS) to directly reduce the discrepancy between the rollout model and the evolving policy. Jackpot integrates a principled OBRS procedure, a unified training objective that jointly updates the policy and rollout models, and an efficient system implementation enabled by top-$k$ probability estimation and batch-level bias correction. Our theoretical analysis shows that OBRS consistently moves the rollout distribution closer to the target distribution under a controllable acceptance budget. Empirically, \sys substantially improves training stability compared to importance-sampling baselines, achieving performance comparable to on-policy RL when training Qwen3-8B-Base for up to 300 update steps of batchsize 64. Taken together, our results show that OBRS-based alignment brings us a step closer to practical and effective decoupling of rollout generation from policy optimization for RL for LLMs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities, achieving impressive results across a wide range of tasks. Despite these advances, significant reasoning failures persist, occurring even in seemingly simple scenarios. To systematically understand and address these shortcomings, we present the first comprehensive survey dedicated to reasoning failures in LLMs. We introduce a novel categorization framework that distinguishes reasoning into embodied and non-embodied types, with the latter further subdivided into informal (intuitive) and formal (logical) reasoning. In parallel, we classify reasoning failures along a complementary axis into three types: fundamental failures intrinsic to LLM architectures that broadly affect downstream tasks; application-specific limitations that manifest in particular domains; and robustness issues characterized by inconsistent performance across minor variations. For each reasoning failure, we provide a clear definition, analyze existing studies, explore root causes, and present mitigation strategies. By unifying fragmented research efforts, our survey provides a structured perspective on systemic weaknesses in LLM reasoning, offering valuable insights and guiding future research towards building stronger, more reliable, and robust reasoning capabilities. We additionally release a comprehensive collection of research works on LLM reasoning failures, as a GitHub repository at https://github.com/Peiyang-Song/Awesome-LLM-Reasoning-Failures, to provide an easy entry point to this area.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework for the logical specification of non-Markovian rewards in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with large state spaces. Our approach leverages Linear Temporal Logic Modulo Theories over finite traces (LTLfMT), a more expressive extension of classical temporal logic in which predicates are first-order formulas of arbitrary first-order theories rather than simple Boolean variables. This enhanced expressiveness enables the specification of complex tasks over unstructured and heterogeneous data domains, promoting a unified and reusable framework that eliminates the need for manual predicate encoding. However, the increased expressive power of LTLfMT introduces additional theoretical and computational challenges compared to standard LTLf specifications. We address these challenges from a theoretical standpoint, identifying a fragment of LTLfMT that is tractable but sufficiently expressive for reward specification in an infinite-state-space context. From a practical perspective, we introduce a method based on reward machines and Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) to translate first-order logic specifications and address reward sparsity. We evaluate this approach to a continuous-control setting using Non-Linear Arithmetic Theory, showing that it enables natural specification of complex tasks. Experimental results show how a tailored implementation of HER is fundamental in solving tasks with complex goals.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in high-stakes domains where optimal actions depend on both uncertainty about the world and consideration of utilities of different outcomes, yet their decision logic remains difficult to interpret. We study whether LLMs are rational utility maximizers with coherent beliefs and stable preferences. We consider behaviors of models for diagnosis challenge problems. The results provide insights about the relationship of LLM inferences to ideal Bayesian utility maximization for elicited probabilities and observed actions. Our approach provides falsifiable conditions under which the reported probabilities \emph{cannot} correspond to the true beliefs of any rational agent. We apply this methodology to multiple medical diagnostic domains with evaluations across several LLMs. We discuss implications of the results and directions forward for uses of LLMs in guiding high-stakes decisions.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have advanced rapidly; however, existing benchmarks in mathematics, code, and common-sense reasoning remain limited. They lack long-context evaluation, offer insufficient challenge, and provide answers that are difficult to verify programmatically. We introduce GrAlgoBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs through graph algorithm problems. Such problems are particularly well suited for probing reasoning abilities: they demand long-context reasoning, allow fine-grained control of difficulty levels, and enable standardized, programmatic evaluation. Across nine tasks, our systematic experiments reveal two major weaknesses of current LRMs. First, accuracy deteriorates sharply as context length increases, falling below 50% once graphs exceed 120 nodes. This degradation is driven by frequent execution errors, weak memory, and redundant reasoning. Second, LRMs suffer from an over-thinking phenomenon, primarily caused by extensive yet largely ineffective self-verification, which inflates reasoning traces without improving correctness. By exposing these limitations, GrAlgoBench establishes graph algorithm problems as a rigorous, multidimensional, and practically relevant testbed for advancing the study of reasoning in LRMs. Code is available at https://github.com/Bklight999/GrAlgoBench.

Abstract: GUI grounding maps natural language instructions to the correct interface elements, serving as the perception foundation for GUI agents. Existing approaches predominantly rely on fine-tuning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) using large-scale GUI datasets to predict target element coordinates, which is data-intensive and generalizes poorly to unseen interfaces. Recent attention-based alternatives exploit localization signals in MLLMs attention mechanisms without task-specific fine-tuning, but suffer from low reliability due to the lack of explicit and complementary spatial anchors in GUI images. To address this limitation, we propose Trifuse, an attention-based grounding framework that explicitly integrates complementary spatial anchors. Trifuse integrates attention, OCR-derived textual cues, and icon-level caption semantics via a Consensus-SinglePeak (CS) fusion strategy that enforces cross-modal agreement while retaining sharp localization peaks. Extensive evaluations on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that Trifuse achieves strong performance without task-specific fine-tuning, substantially reducing the reliance on expensive annotated data. Moreover, ablation studies reveal that incorporating OCR and caption cues consistently improves attention-based grounding performance across different backbones, highlighting its effectiveness as a general framework for GUI grounding.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), exemplified by DeepSeek-R1, have underscored the potential of scaling inference-time compute through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, GRPO frequently suffers from gradient signal attenuation when encountering problems that are either too trivial or overly complex. In these scenarios, the disappearance of inter-group advantages makes the gradient signal susceptible to noise, thereby jeopardizing convergence stability. While variants like DAPO attempt to rectify gradient vanishing, they do not alleviate the substantial computational overhead incurred by exhaustive rollouts on low-utility samples. In this paper, we propose Difficulty-Estimated Policy Optimization (DEPO), a novel framework designed to optimize the efficiency and robustness of reasoning alignment. DEPO integrates an online Difficulty Estimator that dynamically assesses and filters training data before the rollout phase. This mechanism ensures that computational resources are prioritized for samples with high learning potential. Empirical results demonstrate that DEPO achieves up to a 2x reduction in rollout costs without compromising model performance. Our approach significantly lowers the computational barrier for training high-performance reasoning models, offering a more sustainable path for reasoning scaling. Code and data will be released upon acceptance.

We present QA-Token (Quality-Aware Tokenization), which incorporates data reliability directly into vocabulary construction. We make three key contributions: (i) a bilevel optimization formulation that jointly optimizes vocabulary construction and downstream performance, (ii) a reinforcement learning approach that learns merge policies through quality-aware rewards with convergence guarantees, and (iii) an adaptive parameter learning mechanism via Gumbel-Softmax relaxation for end-to-end optimization. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates consistent improvements: genomics (6.7 percentage point F1 gain in variant calling over BPE), finance (30% Sharpe ratio improvement). At foundation scale, we tokenize a pretraining corpus comprising 1.7 trillion base-pairs and achieve state-of-the-art pathogen detection (94.53 MCC) while reducing token count by 15%. We unlock noisy real-world corpora, spanning petabases of genomic sequences and terabytes of financial time series, for foundation model training with zero inference overhead.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities, yet their performance often deteriorates sharply in long-horizon tasks, exhibiting systematic breakdown beyond certain scales. Conventional explanations primarily attribute this phenomenon to task complexity, such as combinatorial search explosion or long-term credit assignment challenges. In this work, we argue that these explanations are incomplete: even in linear, unbranched tasks without semantic ambiguity, autoregressive execution is subject to an intrinsic stability limit.
  We propose that the fundamental constraint on long-horizon reasoning arises from process-level instability in autoregressive generation rather than solely from search or task complexity, reframing long-horizon reasoning as a problem of structural governance. We derive Theorem~A, showing that decision advantage in single-path autoregressive reasoning decays exponentially with execution length, imposing a fundamental bound on maintainable reasoning chains. This result implies a structural consequence: stable long-horizon reasoning requires discrete segmentation, naturally inducing graph-like execution structures such as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).
  Empirical studies in both synthetic environments and real TextWorld tasks reveal observable performance cliffs consistent with theoretical predictions. Our findings provide a dynamical perspective on long-horizon reasoning failure and suggest new limitations on maintaining long-term coherence under purely autoregressive architectures. Furthermore, we highlight that short-horizon evaluation protocols may obscure structural instability, indicating a potential shift from scaling toward structured governance in future reasoning systems.

Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown remarkable potential for solving complex tasks, existing systems remain heavily reliant on large-scale models, leaving the capabilities of edge-scale models largely underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic study on training agentic models at the 4B-parameter scale. We identify three primary bottlenecks hindering the performance of edge-scale models: catastrophic forgetting during Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), sensitivity to reward signal noise during Reinforcement Learning (RL), and reasoning degradation caused by redundant information in long-context scenarios. To address the issues, we propose AgentCPM-Explore, a compact 4B agent model with high knowledge density and strong exploration capability. We introduce a holistic training framework featuring parameter-space model fusion, reward signal denoising, and contextual information refinement. Through deep exploration, AgentCPM-Explore achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among 4B-class models, matches or surpasses 8B-class SOTA models on four benchmarks, and even outperforms larger-scale models such as Claude-4.5-Sonnet or DeepSeek-v3.2 in five benchmarks. Notably, AgentCPM-Explore achieves 97.09% accuracy on GAIA text-based tasks under pass@64. These results provide compelling evidence that the bottleneck for edge-scale models is not their inherent capability ceiling, but rather their inference stability. Based on our well-established training framework, AgentCPM-Explore effectively unlocks the significant, yet previously underestimated, potential of edge-scale models.

Abstract: Evaluating agentic AI on open-ended professional tasks faces a fundamental dilemma between rigor and flexibility. Static rubrics provide rigorous, reproducible assessment but fail to accommodate diverse valid response strategies, while LLM-as-a-judge approaches adapt to individual responses yet suffer from instability and bias. Human experts address this dilemma by combining domain-grounded principles with dynamic, claim-level assessment. Inspired by this process, we propose JADE, a two-layer evaluation framework. Layer 1 encodes expert knowledge as a predefined set of evaluation skills, providing stable evaluation criteria. Layer 2 performs report-specific, claim-level evaluation to flexibly assess diverse reasoning strategies, with evidence-dependency gating to invalidate conclusions built on refuted claims. Experiments on BizBench show that JADE improves evaluation stability and reveals critical agent failure modes missed by holistic LLM-based evaluators. We further demonstrate strong alignment with expert-authored rubrics and effective transfer to a medical-domain benchmark, validating JADE across professional domains. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/smiling-world/JADE.

Abstract: Behavior Trees (BTs) provide a structured and reactive framework for decision-making, commonly used to switch between sub-controllers based on environmental conditions. Reinforcement Learning (RL), on the other hand, can learn near-optimal controllers but sometimes struggles with sparse rewards, safe exploration, and long-horizon credit assignment. Combining BTs with RL has the potential for mutual benefit: a BT design encodes structured domain knowledge that can simplify RL training, while RL enables automatic learning of the controllers within BTs. However, naive integration of BTs and RL can lead to some controllers counteracting other controllers, possibly undoing previously achieved subgoals, thereby degrading the overall performance. To address this, we propose progress constraints, a novel mechanism where feasibility estimators constrain the allowed action set based on theoretical BT convergence results. Empirical evaluations in a 2D proof-of-concept and a high-fidelity warehouse environment demonstrate improved performance, sample efficiency, and constraint satisfaction, compared to prior methods of BT-RL integration.

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute with multi-path chain-of-thought improves reasoning accuracy, but its effectiveness depends critically on the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Existing approaches address this trade-off in rigid ways: tree-structured search hard-codes exploration through brittle expansion rules that interfere with post-trained reasoning, while parallel reasoning over-explores redundant hypothesis paths and relies on weak answer selection. Motivated by the observation that the optimal balance is phase-dependent and that correct and incorrect reasoning paths often diverge only at late stages, we reformulate test-time scaling as a dynamic expand-reduce control problem over a pool of hypotheses. We propose HyPER, a training-free online control policy for multi-path decoding in mixture-of-experts models that reallocates computation under a fixed budget using lightweight path statistics. HyPER consists of an online controller that transitions from exploration to exploitation as the hypothesis pool evolves, a token-level refinement mechanism that enables efficient generation-time exploitation without full-path resampling, and a length- and confidence-aware aggregation strategy for reliable answer-time exploitation. Experiments on four mixture-of-experts language models across diverse reasoning benchmarks show that HyPER consistently achieves a superior accuracy-compute trade-off, improving accuracy by 8 to 10 percent while reducing token usage by 25 to 40 percent.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated notable performance across various logical reasoning benchmarks. However, it remains unclear which core logical skills they truly master. To address this, we introduce LogicSkills, a unified benchmark designed to isolate three fundamental skills in formal reasoning: (i) $\textit{formal symbolization}\unicode{x2014}$translating premises into first-order logic; (ii) $\textit{countermodel construction}\unicode{x2014}$formulating a finite structure in which all premises are true while the conclusion is false; and (iii) $\textit{validity assessment}\unicode{x2014}$deciding whether a conclusion follows from a given set of premises. Items are drawn from the two-variable fragment of first-order logic (without identity) and are presented in both natural English and a Carroll-style language with nonce words. All examples are verified for correctness and non-triviality using the SMT solver Z3. Across leading models, performance is high on validity but substantially lower on symbolization and countermodel construction, suggesting reliance on surface-level patterns rather than genuine symbolic or rule-based reasoning.

Abstract: Generating deep research reports requires large-scale information acquisition and the synthesis of insight-driven analysis, posing a significant challenge for current language models. Most existing approaches follow a plan-then-write paradigm, whose performance heavily depends on the quality of the initial outline. However, constructing a comprehensive outline itself demands strong reasoning ability, causing current deep research systems to rely almost exclusively on closed-source or online large models. This reliance raises practical barriers to deployment and introduces safety and privacy concerns for user-authored data. In this work, we present AgentCPM-Report, a lightweight yet high-performing local solution composed of a framework that mirrors the human writing process and an 8B-parameter deep research agent. Our framework uses a Writing As Reasoning Policy (WARP), which enables models to dynamically revise outlines during report generation. Under this policy, the agent alternates between Evidence-Based Drafting and Reasoning-Driven Deepening, jointly supporting information acquisition, knowledge refinement, and iterative outline evolution. To effectively equip small models with this capability, we introduce a Multi-Stage Agentic Training strategy, consisting of cold-start, atomic skill RL, and holistic pipeline RL. Experiments on DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and DeepResearch Gym demonstrate that AgentCPM-Report outperforms leading closed-source systems, with substantial gains in Insight.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as the predominant paradigm for training large language model (LLM)-based AI agents. However, existing backbone RL algorithms lack verified convergence guarantees in agentic scenarios, especially in multi-turn settings, which can lead to training instability and failure to converge to optimal policies.
  In this paper, we systematically analyze how different combinations of policy update mechanisms and advantage estimation methods affect convergence properties in single/multi-turn scenarios. We find that REINFORCE with Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE) can converge to the globally optimal under undiscounted conditions, but the combination of PPO & GRAE breaks PPO's original monotonic improvement property. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mainstream backbone RL algorithms cannot simultaneously achieve both critic-free and convergence guarantees in multi-turn scenarios.
  To address this, we propose SeeUPO (Sequence-level Sequential Update Policy Optimization), a critic-free approach with convergence guarantees for multi-turn interactions. SeeUPO models multi-turn interaction as sequentially executed multi-agent bandit problems. Through turn-by-turn sequential policy updates in reverse execution order, it ensures monotonic improvement and convergence to global optimal solution via backward induction.
  Experiments on AppWorld and BFCL v4 demonstrate SeeUPO's substantial improvements over existing backbone algorithms: relative gains of 43.3%-54.6% on Qwen3-14B and 24.1%-41.9% on Qwen2.5-14B (averaged across benchmarks), along with superior training stability.

Abstract: The robustness of Vision Language Models (VLMs) is commonly assessed through output-level invariance, implicitly assuming that stable predictions reflect stable multimodal processing. In this work, we argue that this assumption is insufficient. We introduce a representation-aware and frequency-aware evaluation framework that measures internal embedding drift, spectral sensitivity, and structural smoothness (spatial consistency of vision tokens), alongside standard label-based metrics. Applying this framework to modern VLMs across the SEEDBench, MMMU, and POPE datasets reveals three distinct failure modes. First, models frequently preserve predicted answers while undergoing substantial internal representation drift; for perturbations such as text overlays, this drift approaches the magnitude of inter-image variability, indicating that representations move to regions typically occupied by unrelated inputs despite unchanged outputs. Second, robustness does not improve with scale; larger models achieve higher accuracy but exhibit equal or greater sensitivity, consistent with sharper yet more fragile decision boundaries. Third, we find that perturbations affect tasks differently: they harm reasoning when they disrupt how models combine coarse and fine visual cues, but on the hallucination benchmarks, they can reduce false positives by making models generate more conservative answers.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph (KG) generation requires models to learn complex semantic dependencies between triples while maintaining domain validity constraints. Unlike link prediction, which scores triples independently, generative models must capture interdependencies across entire subgraphs to produce semantically coherent structures. We present ARK (Auto-Regressive Knowledge Graph Generation), a family of autoregressive models that generate KGs by treating graphs as sequences of (head, relation, tail) triples. ARK learns implicit semantic constraints directly from data, including type consistency, temporal validity, and relational patterns, without explicit rule supervision. On the IntelliGraphs benchmark, our models achieve 89.2% to 100.0% semantic validity across diverse datasets while generating novel graphs not seen during training. We also introduce SAIL, a variational extension of ARK that enables controlled generation through learned latent representations, supporting both unconditional sampling and conditional completion from partial graphs. Our analysis reveals that model capacity (hidden dimensionality >= 64) is more critical than architectural depth for KG generation, with recurrent architectures achieving comparable validity to transformer-based alternatives while offering substantial computational efficiency. These results demonstrate that autoregressive models provide an effective framework for KG generation, with practical applications in knowledge base completion and query answering.

We consider tasks specified as linear temporal logic (LTL) formulae, which are commonly used in formal methods to specify properties of systems, and have recently been successfully adopted in RL. In this setting, we present a novel task embedding technique leveraging a new generation of semantic LTL-to-automata translations, originally developed for temporal synthesis. The resulting semantically labelled automata contain rich, structured information in each state that allow us to (i) compute the automaton efficiently on-the-fly, (ii) extract expressive task embeddings used to condition the policy, and (iii) naturally support full LTL. Experimental results in a variety of domains demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and is able to scale to complex specifications where existing methods fail.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as an efficient alternative to the transformer architecture. Recent studies show that SSMs can match or surpass Transformers on code understanding tasks, such as code retrieval, when trained under similar conditions. However, their internal mechanisms remain a black box. We present the first systematic analysis of what SSM-based code models actually learn and perform the first comparative analysis of SSM and Transformer-based code models. Our analysis reveals that SSMs outperform Transformers at capturing code syntax and semantics in pretraining but forgets certain syntactic and semantic relations during fine-tuning on task, especially when the task emphasizes short-range dependencies. To diagnose this, we introduce SSM-Interpret, a frequency-domain framework that exposes a spectral shift toward short-range dependencies during fine-tuning. Guided by these findings, we propose architectural modifications that significantly improve the performance of SSM-based code model, validating that our analysis directly enables better models.

Abstract: Human concept learning is typically active: learners choose which instances to query or test in order to reduce uncertainty about an underlying rule or category. Active concept learning must balance informativeness of queries against the stability of the learner that generates and scores hypotheses. We study this trade-off in a neuro-symbolic Bayesian learner whose hypotheses are executable programs proposed by a large language model (LLM) and reweighted by Bayesian updating. We compare a Rational Active Learner that selects queries to maximize approximate expected information gain (EIG) and the human-like Positive Test Strategy (PTS) that queries instances predicted to be positive under the current best hypothesis. Across concept-learning tasks in the classic Number Game, EIG is effective when falsification is necessary (e.g., compound or exception-laden rules), but underperforms on simple concepts. We trace this failure to a support mismatch between the EIG policy and the LLM proposal distribution: highly diagnostic boundary queries drive the posterior toward regions where the generator produces invalid or overly specific programs, yielding a support-mismatch trap in the particle approximation. PTS is information-suboptimal but tends to maintain proposal validity by selecting "safe" queries, leading to faster convergence on simple rules. Our results suggest that "confirmation bias" may not be a cognitive error, but rather a rational adaptation for maintaining tractable inference in the sparse, open-ended hypothesis spaces characteristic of human thought.

Abstract: Training generalist agents capable of adapting to diverse scenarios requires interactive environments for self-exploration. However, interactive environments remain critically scarce, and existing synthesis methods suffer from significant limitations regarding environmental diversity and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce ScaleEnv, a framework that constructs fully interactive environments and verifiable tasks entirely from scratch. Specifically, ScaleEnv ensures environment reliability through procedural testing, and guarantees task completeness and solvability via tool dependency graph expansion and executable action verification. By enabling agents to learn through exploration within ScaleEnv, we demonstrate significant performance improvements on unseen, multi-turn tool-use benchmarks such as $τ^2$-Bench and VitaBench, highlighting strong generalization capabilities. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between increasing number of domains and model generalization performance, providing empirical evidence that scaling environmental diversity is critical for robust agent learning.

Abstract: Large foundation models (LFMs) achieve strong performance through scaling, yet current structural pruning methods derive fixed pruning decisions during inference, overlooking sparsity patterns that emerge in the autoregressive token generation. In this paper, we propose POP (Partition-guided Online Pruning), an efficient online structural pruning framework that enables context-conditioned dynamic pruning with minimal computational overhead. POP partitions model channels into retained, candidate, and pruned regions, where prefilling defines a coarse pruning partition, and the decoding stage generates a fine-grained mask within the candidate region, avoiding full-channel re-evaluation. The coarse pruning partition preserves consistently important weights, while the fine-grained masking provides context-conditioned variation during decoding. Moreover, POP is a lightweight, plug-and-play method that requires no preprocessing, including offline calibration, retraining, or learning predictors. Extensive evaluations across diverse LFMs, including large language models (LLMs), mixture-of-experts models (MoEs), and vision-language models (VLMs), demonstrate that POP consistently delivers higher accuracy than existing pruning approaches while incurring smaller computational overhead and minimizing inference latency.

Abstract: We develop a game-theoretic framework for predicting and steering the behavior of populations of large language models (LLMs) through Nash equilibrium (NE) analysis. To avoid the intractability of equilibrium computation in open-ended text spaces, we model each agent's action as a mixture over human subpopulations. Agents choose actively and strategically which groups to align with, yielding an interpretable and behaviorally substantive policy class. We derive closed-form NE characterizations, adopting standard concave-utility assumptions to enable analytical system-level predictions and give explicit, actionable guidance for shifting alignment targets toward socially desirable outcomes. The method functions as an active alignment layer on top of existing alignment pipelines such as RLHF. In a social-media setting, we show that a population of LLMs, especially reasoning-based models, may exhibit political exclusion, pathologies where some subpopulations are ignored by all LLM agents, which can be avoided by our method, illustrating the promise of applying the method to regulate multi-agent LLM dynamics across domains.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, in practical deployments, device heterogeneity, non-independent, and identically distributed (Non-IID) data often lead to highly unstable and biased gradient updates. When differential privacy is enforced, conventional fixed gradient clipping and Gaussian noise injection may further amplify gradient perturbations, resulting in training oscillation and performance degradation and degraded model performance. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive differentially private federated learning framework that explicitly targets model efficiency under heterogeneous and privacy-constrained settings. On the client side, a lightweight local compressed module is introduced to regularize intermediate representations and constrain gradient variability, thereby mitigating noise amplification during local optimization. On the server side, an adaptive gradient clipping strategy dynamically adjusts clipping thresholds based on historical update statistics to avoid over-clipping and noise domination. Furthermore, a constraint-aware aggregation mechanism is designed to suppress unreliable or noise-dominated client updates and stabilize global optimization. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and SVHN demonstrate improved convergence stability and classification accuracy.

Abstract: Over the last decade, explainable AI has primarily focused on interpreting individual model predictions, producing post-hoc explanations that relate inputs to outputs under a fixed decision structure. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agentic AI systems whose behaviour unfolds over multi-step trajectories. In these settings, success and failure are determined by sequences of decisions rather than a single output. While useful, it remains unclear how explanation approaches designed for static predictions translate to agentic settings where behaviour emerges over time. In this work, we bridge the gap between static and agentic explainability by comparing attribution-based explanations with trace-based diagnostics across both settings. To make this distinction explicit, we empirically compare attribution-based explanations used in static classification tasks with trace-based diagnostics used in agentic benchmarks (TAU-bench Airline and AssistantBench). Our results show that while attribution methods achieve stable feature rankings in static settings (Spearman $ρ= 0.86$), they cannot be applied reliably to diagnose execution-level failures in agentic trajectories. In contrast, trace-grounded rubric evaluation for agentic settings consistently localizes behaviour breakdowns and reveals that state tracking inconsistency is 2.7$\times$ more prevalent in failed runs and reduces success probability by 49\%. These findings motivate a shift towards trajectory-level explainability for agentic systems when evaluating and diagnosing autonomous AI behaviour.

Abstract: LLM agents hold significant promise for advancing scientific research. To accelerate this progress, we introduce AIRS-Bench (the AI Research Science Benchmark), a suite of 20 tasks sourced from state-of-the-art machine learning papers. These tasks span diverse domains, including language modeling, mathematics, bioinformatics, and time series forecasting. AIRS-Bench tasks assess agentic capabilities over the full research lifecycle -- including idea generation, experiment analysis and iterative refinement -- without providing baseline code. The AIRS-Bench task format is versatile, enabling easy integration of new tasks and rigorous comparison across different agentic frameworks. We establish baselines using frontier models paired with both sequential and parallel scaffolds. Our results show that agents exceed human SOTA in four tasks but fail to match it in sixteen others. Even when agents surpass human benchmarks, they do not reach the theoretical performance ceiling for the underlying tasks. These findings indicate that AIRS-Bench is far from saturated and offers substantial room for improvement. We open-source the AIRS-Bench task definitions and evaluation code to catalyze further development in autonomous scientific research.

All results exhibit agentic overconfidence: some agents that succeed only 22% of the time predict 77% success. Counterintuitively, pre-execution assessment with strictly less information tends to yield better discrimination than standard post-execution review, though differences are not always significant. Adversarial prompting reframing assessment as bug-finding achieves the best calibration.

Abstract: The preparation of $n$-qubit quantum states is a cross-cutting subroutine for many quantum algorithms, and the effort to reduce its circuit complexity is a significant challenge. In the literature, the quantum state preparation algorithm by Sun et al. is known to be optimally bounded, defining the asymptotically optimal width-depth trade-off bounds with and without ancillary qubits. In this work, a simpler algebraic decomposition is proposed to separate the preparation of the real part of the desired state from the complex one, resulting in a reduction in terms of circuit depth, total gates, and CNOT count when $m$ ancillary qubits are available. The reduction in complexity is due to the use of a single operator $Λ$ for each uniformly controlled gate, instead of the three in the original decomposition. Using the PennyLane library, this new algorithm for state preparation has been implemented and tested in a simulated environment for both dense and sparse quantum states, including those that are random and of physical interest. Furthermore, its performance has been compared with that of Möttönen et al.'s algorithm, which is a de facto standard for preparing quantum states in cases where no ancillary qubits are used, highlighting interesting lines of development.

Abstract: Quantum-gravity-induced entanglement of massive systems (QGEM) is commonly approximated in the nonrelativistic static limit by a Newtonian interaction between spatially separated masses. In this work, we reformulate the gravitationally mediated interaction phase in a conformally invariant twistor framework in which no notion of spacetime distance is assumed. We show that the bilocal phase responsible for entanglement generation remains well-defined and non-factorizable even in the absence of spacetime geometry. The familiar Newtonian $1/r$ phase, relevant for QGEM protocols, arises only after the conformal invariance is broken by introducing the infinity twistor, which selects a particular spacetime representation of the underlying bilocal quantum interaction. Our results isolate the genuinely quantum content of QGEM protocols and clarify the contingent role played by spacetime geometry in mediating entanglement.

Abstract: Analog quantum simulators and digital quantum computers are two distinct paradigms driving near-term applications in modern quantum science, from probing many-body phenomena to identifying computational advantage over classical systems. A transformative opportunity on the horizon is merging the high-fidelity many-body evolution in analog simulators with the robust control and measurement of digital machines. Such a hybrid platform would unlock new capabilities in state preparation, characterization and dynamical control. Here, we embed digital quantum control in the analog evolution of a synthetic quantum material by entangling the lattice potential landscape of a Bose-Hubbard circuit with an ancilla qubit. This Hamiltonian-level control induces dynamics under a superposition of different lattice configurations and guides the many-body system to novel strongly-correlated states where different phases of matter coexist -- ordering photons into superpositions of solid and fluid eigenstates. Leveraging hybrid control modalities, we adiabatically introduce disorder to localize the photons into an entangled cat state and enhance its coherence using a many-body echo technique. This work illustrates the potential for entangling quantum computers with quantum matter -- synthetic and solid-state -- for advantage in sensing and materials characterization.

Abstract: Quantum many-body systems driven far from equilibrium can exhibit chaos, entanglement, and non-classical correlations, yet directly observing these phenomena in large, closed quantum systems remains challenging. Here we realize the Dicke model -- a fundamental description of light-matter interactions -- in a two-dimensional crystal of approximately 100 trapped ions. The ions' internal state is optically coupled to the center of mass vibrational mode via an optical spin-dependent force, enabling unitary many-body dynamics beyond the mean-field and few-body limits. In the integrable regime, where the phonons can be adiabatically eliminated, we observe a dynamical phase transition between ferromagnetic to paramagnetic spin phases. In contrast, when the spins and phonons are strongly coupled, we observe clear signatures of non-integrable chaotic dynamics, including erratic phase-space trajectories and the exponential growth of excitations and entanglement quantified by the one-body Rényi entropy. By quenching from an unstable fixed point in the near-integrable regime, quantum noise can generate correlated spin-phonon excitations. Our numerical calculations, in clear agreement with experiment, reveal the generation of two-mode spin-phonon squeezing, 2.6 dB below the standard quantum limit (4.6 dB relative to the initial thermal state), followed by generalized vacuum Rabi collapses and revivals. Our results establish large ion crystals as scalable analog quantum simulators of non-equilibrium light-matter dynamics and provide a controlled platform for experimental studies of information scrambling and entanglement in closed many-body systems.

Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) describe fundamental interactions in particle physics. A central phenomenon in these theories is confinement, which binds quarks and antiquarks into hadrons through the formation of string-like flux tubes of gauge fields. Simulating confinement dynamics is a challenging task, but recent advances in quantum simulation are enabling the exploration of LGTs in regimes beyond the reach of classical computation. For analog devices, a major difficulty is the realization of strong plaquette interactions, which generate string fluctuations that can drive a roughening transition. Understanding string roughening -- where strong transversal functions lead to an effective restoration of translational symmetry at long distances -- is of central importance in the study of confinement. In this work, we show that string roughening emerges naturally in an analog Rydberg quantum simulator. We first map a triangular Rydberg array onto a (2+1)D U(1) LGT where plaquette terms appear as first-order processes. We study flux strings connecting static charges and demonstrate that, near a deconfined quantum critical point, the string exhibits logarithmic growth of its transverse width as the separation between charges increases, along with the universal Lüscher correction to the confining potential -- both signatures of string roughening. Finally, we investigate the real-time dynamics of an initially rigid string, observing large fluctuations after quenching into the roughening regime, as well as string breaking via particle-pair creation. Our results indicate that rough strings can be realized in experimentally accessible quantum simulators, opening the door to detailed studies of how strong fluctuations influence string-breaking dynamics.

Abstract: Reliable preparation of many-body ground states is an essential task in quantum computing, with applications spanning areas from chemistry and materials modeling to quantum optimization and benchmarking. A variety of approaches have been proposed to tackle this problem, including variational methods. However, variational training often struggle to navigate complex energy landscapes, frequently encountering suboptimal local minima or suffering from barren plateaus. In this work, we introduce an iterative strategy for ground-state preparation based on a stepwise (discretized) Hamiltonian deformation. By complementing the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) with adiabatic principles, we demonstrate that solving a sequence of intermediate problems facilitates tracking the ground-state manifold toward the target system, even as we scale the system size. We provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for this approach, proving a lower bound on the loss variance that suggests trainability throughout the deformation, provided the system remains away from gap closings. Numerical simulations, including the effects of shot noise, confirm that this path-dependent tracking consistently converges to the target ground state.

Abstract: We propose a method for directly measuring the quantum mechanical pseudo-distribution of observable properties via its characteristic function. Vandermonde matrices of the eigenvalues play a central role in the theory. This proposal directly finds the pseudo-distribution using weak measurements of the generator of position moments (momentum translations). While the pseudo-distribution can be extracted from the data in a theory-agnostic way, it is shown that under quantum-mechanical formalism, the predicted pseudo-distribution is identified with the Kirkwood-Dirac pseudo-distribution. We discuss the construction of both the joint pseudo-distribution and a conditional pseudo-distribution, which is closely connected to weak-value physics. By permuting position and momentum measurements, we give a prescription to directly probe the canonical commutation relation and verify it for any quantum state. This work establishes the theory of a characteristic function approach to pseudo-distributions, as well as providing a constructive approach to measuring them directly.

Abstract: The N-representability problem for reduced density matrices remains a fundamental challenge in electronic structure theory. Following our previous work that employs a unitary-evolution algorithm based on an adaptive derivative-assembled pseudo-Trotter variational quantum algorithm to probe pure-state N-representability of reduced density matrices [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2024, 20, 9968], in this work we propose a practical framework for determining the ensemble N-representability of a p-body matrix. This is accomplished using a purification strategy consisting of embedding an ensemble state into a pure state defined on an extended Hilbert space, such that the reduced density matrices of the purified state reproduce those of the original ensemble. By iteratively applying variational unitaries to an initial purified state, the proposed algorithm minimizes the Hilbert-Schmidt distance between its p-body reduced density matrix and a specified target p-body matrix, which serves as a measure of the N-representability of the target. This methodology facilitates both error correction of defective ensemble reduced density matrices, and quantum-state reconstruction on a quantum computer, offering a route for density-matrix refinement. We validate the algorithm with numerical simulations on systems of two, three, and four electrons in both, simple models as well as molecular systems at finite temperature, demonstrating its robustness.

Abstract: Quantum computing offers an alternative paradigm for addressing combinatorial optimization problems compared to classical computing. Despite recent hardware improvements, the execution of empirical quantum optimization experiments at scales known to be hard for state-of-the-art classical solvers is not yet in reach. In this work, we offer a different way to approach combinatorial optimization with near-term quantum computing. Motivated by the promising results observed in using quantum-enhanced Markov chain Monte Carlo (QeMCMC) for approximating complicated probability distributions, we combine ideas of sampling from the device with QeMCMC together with warm-starting and parallel tempering, in the context of combinatorial optimization. We demonstrate empirically that our algorithm recovers the global optima for instances of the Maximum Independent Set problem (MIS) up to 117 decision variables using 117 qubits on IBM quantum hardware. We show early evidence of a scaling advantage of our algorithm compared to similar classical methods for the chosen instances of MIS. MIS is practically relevant across domains like financial services and molecular biology, and, in some cases, already difficult to solve to optimality classically with only a few hundred decision variables.

We benchmark the measured output biases against ideal predictions and discuss the impact of device noise. Our results establish a simple, resource-efficient experimental primitive for quantum-to-classical randomness processing and support the viability of quantum Bernoulli factories for quantum-enhanced stochastic simulation and sampling tasks.

Abstract: We present a hybrid classical-quantum image preparation scheme that reduces the quantum implementation cost of image loading for quantum pixel information encoding (QPIE). The proposed method, termed JPEG-assisted QPIE (JQPIE), loads only the quantized JPEG coefficients into a quantum register, leading to substantial reductions in \texttt{CX} gate count and circuit depth while preserving reconstruction quality comparable to classical JPEG compression. We develop two variants of the hybrid strategy. The first realizes the complete JPEG decompression pipeline coherently by implementing inverse quantization via a block-encoded unitary operator. The second, referred to as \emph{quantization-free JQPIE} (QF-JQPIE), omits quantization altogether, thereby avoiding the probabilistic nature of block-encoded quantization. Numerical simulations on standard benchmark image datasets (USC--SIPI and Kodak) demonstrate that both variants achieve significant constant-factor reductions in \texttt{CX} gate count and circuit depth relative to direct QPIE loading, while maintaining high reconstruction quality as measured by PSNR and SSIM.

Abstract: Radiation impacts are a current challenge with computing on superconducting-based quantum devices because they can lead to widespread correlated errors across the device. Such errors can be problematic for quantum error correction (QEC) codes, which are generally designed to correct independent errors. To address this, we have developed a computational model to simulate the effects of radiation impacts on QEC performance. This is achieved by building from recently developed models of quasiparticle density, mapping radiation-induced qubit error rates onto a quantum error channel and simulation of a simple surface code. We also provide a performance metric to quantify the resilience of a QEC code to radiation impacts. Additionally, we sweep various parameters of chip design to test mitigation strategies for improved QEC performance. Our model approach is holistic, allowing for modular performance testing of error mitigation strategies and chip and code designs.

We demonstrate that the required shearing strength for the protocol, which scales linearly with time, decreases with increasing number of atoms ($N$) in proportion to $1/\sqrt{N}$. The resulting states exhibit optimal quantum Fisher information, making them ideal for surpassing the classical limit of phase sensitivity in quantum metrology applications. Notably, our protocol is compatible with a time-reversal strategy for quantum metrology, ensuring its practical viability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Heisenberg limit scaling remains intact even when reducing the twisting employed in tandem with the number of atoms, thereby mitigating realistic losses such as photon scattering.

Abstract: The Moon's permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) are among the coldest places in the Solar System and are expected to become key landing sites for upcoming international space agency missions. Their proximity to peaks of perpetual solar power and potential resource richness makes them prime candidates for lunar exploration and future Moon bases. Here we propose to deploy a passive, ultrastable optical resonator in these regions that will enable laser systems with unprecedented phase-coherence. The unique physical environment of lunar PSRs greatly benefits the construction of a cryogenic monolithic silicon cavity that exhibits low $10^{-18}$ thermal noise-limited stability and coherence time exceeding 1 minute, more than a decade better than the current best terrestrial system. Such a stable laser will form a basic quantum technology infrastructure in space to serve many applications, including establishing a lunar time standard, building long-baseline optical interferometry, distribution of stable optical signals across networks of satellites, testing general relativity and gravitational physics, and forming the backbone for space-based quantum networks.

Abstract: Quantum random number generators (QRNGs) produce true random numbers based on the inherent randomness of quantum theory, rendering them a foundational segment of quantum cryptography. Distinguished from trusted-device QRNGs whose security depends on characterized devices, semi-device-independent (semi-DI) QRNGs permit partial devices to be defective or even maliciously manipulated, which achieves a good trade-off between generation rate and security. In this paper, we propose a semi-DI QRNG that resists general attacks while accounting for finite-size effects. The protocol requires no rigorous characterization of the source and measurement devices other than limiting the energy of the emitted states, significantly reducing the demands on practical QRNG systems. Leveraging the tight Kato inequality for correlated variables, we show that our protocol generates more randomness than it consumes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the scheme on a continuous-variable system with ternary inputs of states. Heterodyne detection is employed to enable phase compensation through data postprocessing, alleviating the stringent requirement on system stability. The system operates at 100 MHz, achieving a net random number generation rate of 1.165 Mbps at 5.3x10^9 rounds. Our work offers a promising approach to achieve both the robust security and high generation rate with a simple experimental setup.

Abstract: Speculative trading can drive pronounced market instabilities, yet existing regulatory and macroprudential tools intervene only after such dynamics emerge. Quantum technologies offer a fundamentally new means of shaping economic behavior by introducing non-classical correlations between decision-makers. Here we demonstrate a prototype quantum stock market in which entanglement between traders' valuations mitigates the runaway devaluation characteristic of speculative busts. Using reinforcement-learning agents trading a single commodity, we show that replacing classical valuations with quantum-correlated qubit-encoded valuations stabilizes prices and increases the AI traders' net worth relative to a classical market, where instead agents rapidly converge to liquidation strategies that collapse the asset value. To explain this behavior, we formulate and analyze a quantized version of the $p$-guessing game, a canonical model of speculative dynamics. Quantum entanglement and phase coherence reshape the strategic landscape, eliminating the pathological pure-strategy Nash equilibrium that drives market collapse in the classical game, while mixed-strategy equilibria remain non-degenerate and avoid bust-type outcomes. These results identify quantum correlations as a novel, endogenous mechanism for market stabilization and, more broadly, demonstrate the utility of multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms for uncovering optimal strategies in complex decision-making frameworks with quantum degrees of freedom.

Abstract: We introduce HyQuRP, a hybrid quantum-classical neural network equivariant to rotational and permutational symmetries. While existing equivariant quantum machine learning models often rely on ad hoc constructions, HyQuRP is built upon the formal foundations of group representation theory. In the sparse-point regime, HyQuRP consistently outperforms strong classical and quantum baselines across multiple benchmarks. For example, when six subsampled points are used, HyQuRP ($\sim$1.5K parameters) achieves 76.13% accuracy on the 5-class ModelNet benchmark, compared to approximately 71% for PointNet, PointMamba, and PointTransformer with similar parameter counts. These results highlight HyQuRP's exceptional data efficiency and suggest the potential of quantum machine learning models for processing 3D point cloud data.

Abstract: Recent quantum-inspired methods based on the Simulated Annealing algorithm have shown strong potential for solving combinatorial optimization problems. However, Grover's algorithm in gate-based quantum computing offers only a quadratic speedup, which remains impractical for large problem sizes. This paper proposes a hybrid approach that integrates Simulated Annealing with Grover's algorithm to achieve sub-exponential speedup, thereby improving its industrial applicability.
  In enzyme fermentation, variables such as temperature, stirring, wait time, pH, tryptophan, rice flour and others are encoded by 625 binary parameters, defining the space of possible enzyme formulations. We aim to find a binary configuration that maximizes the active ingredient, formulated as a 625-bit Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem generated from historical experiments and artificial intelligence techniques. Minimizing the QUBO cost corresponds to maximizing the active ingredient. This case study demonstrates that the proposed hybrid method achieves sub-exponential speedup using gate-based quantum computing.

Abstract: The PL6 color center in silicon carbide has recently emerged as a promising platform for quantum information processing, yet its coherent spin--photon interface has remained largely unexplored. Here we present a comprehensive investigation of single PL6 centers, combining spectroscopy with theoretical analysis. The excited-state fine structure is fully resolved using group-theoretical modeling and strain-dependent measurements. Under resonant excitation, we achieve a spin initialization fidelity of $99.69 \pm 0.03\%$ and a readout contrast of $98.31 \pm 1.03\%$. The spin--photon--entangled $A_2$ transition exhibits narrow optical linewidths ($\sim 180$~MHz) and a polarization visibility of $\sim 82\%$. Coherent optical driving enables Rabi frequencies up to $2.895$~GHz, while dynamical decoupling extends the spin coherence time from $0.5$~ms to $5.70$~ms. Our results establish PL6 as a competitive solid-state spin--photon interface hosted in a commercially available semiconductor platform.

Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics of ligand--receptor electron transfer and conformational response in a prototypical viral binding complex, using the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein bound to the human ACE2 receptor as a model system. Treating the ACE2--Spike interface as an open quantum system embedded in a biological environment, we simulate how vibrational interactions and environmental memory reshape the coupled receptor--ligand dynamics and modulate vibrationally assisted electron transfer (VA-ET). Using a Non-Markovian Stochastic Schr"odinger Equation (NMSSE) approach, we simulate electron transfer between donor and acceptor states in ACE2 modulated by a specific vibrational mode of the Spike protein. The influence of environmental memory (non-Markovian dynamics) and non-Condon effects (vibrational modulation of electronic coupling) are analyzed in detail. In the Markovian limit with an Ohmic bath, population dynamics reduce to exponential kinetics, and extracted transfer rates agree with semiclassical Marcus--Jortner predictions in the appropriate regime. Beyond the Markovian, high-temperature limit, we observe clear deviations: non-exponential decay, coherent oscillatory features, and enhanced sensitivity to the vibrational frequency. Incorporating off-diagonal system--bath coupling alongside diagonal coupling shows that nuclear motion can dynamically gate electron tunneling, sharpening the frequency selectivity of the VA-ET mechanism. Finally, a structured (sub-Ohmic) environmental spectral density with long-lived correlations (``memory'') preserves electronic--vibrational coherence over longer times, amplifying vibrational selectivity under non-Condon coupling. Our results support the proposition that ACE2--Spike binding may exploit vibrational assistance and quantum coherence as a molecular recognition mechanism.

Abstract: We present a relaxation-based method to bound expectation values on the steady state of dissipative many-body quantum systems described by master equations of the Lindblad form. Instead of targeting to represent the entire state, we promote the reduced density matrices to our variables and enforce the constraints that are imposed on them by consistency with a global steady state. The resulting constraints have the form of a semidefinite program, which allows us to efficiently bound the values a given expectation value can take in the steady state. Our results show fast convergence of the bounds with the size of the reduced density matrices, giving very competitive predictions for the steady state of several one- and two-dimensional models for an arbitrary number of particles.

Abstract: Universal quantum computing requires an architecture that supports both linear circuits and, crucially, strong nonlinear resources. For quantum photonic systems, integrating such nonlinearities with scalable linear circuitry has been a major bottleneck, leaving most optical experiments without nonlinear operations and, consequently, incapable of achieving universality. Here, we report an extensible photonic computer that supports a universal gate set by seamlessly combining fully programmable, scalable linear optical networks with integrated nonlinear modules. This platform enables a broad range of quantum computing and simulation tasks. We demonstrate the quasi-deterministic generation of optical Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states, which are essential resources for bosonic error correction, yet had previously been realized only probabilistically. Furthermore, we simulate complex many-body quantum dynamics, exemplified by the Bose-Hubbard model. Such quantum simulation tasks have long been considered beyond the reach of photonic hardware limited to linear operations. These capabilities, enabled by our extensible architecture, establish a viable route towards photonic quantum simulation and fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Abstract: Robust quantum transmission is driving a new paradigm in space-ground quantum networking. Although phase encoding has been widely adopted in terrestrial fiber channels, it has long been considered unsuitable for free-space quantum communication. Here, we demonstrate phase-encoded quantum communication over 1400 m of urban free space. The system maintained stable operation for nearly one hour, achieving 99.07% interference visibility and an average quantum bit error rate of 2.38%. The free-space quantum states were directly coupled into the fiber and transmitted over an additional 10 km, confirming seamless interoperability across different media. We further show that turbulence-induced phase drifts between successive picosecond pulses can be effectively compensated. A cascaded-link model and numerical simulations indicate feasibility over free-space distances exceeding 30 km, underscoring the potential for satellite-to-ground quantum links. This work establishes the viability of phase encoding in free-space quantum networks, simplifying cross-medium integration and enabling compatibility with existing classical infrastructures.

Abstract: We report a normal-mode induced synchronization blockade in coupled quantum van der Pol oscillators under the influence of external drive. In this mechanism, the coupling hybridizes the oscillator modes into spectrally split normal modes. The destructive interference between the transitions to these modes blocks synchronization. We find that this blockade can be controlled simply by tuning the coupling strength and detuning allowing dynamic manipulation of quantum synchronization through collective mode dynamics. We analyze the phase-locking behaviour using perturbation analysis. Further, by deriving steady-state probability amplitudes we show how the energy redistribution and spectral splitting forms the basis of the blockade. Our results might provide new insights into how synchronization can be controlled in quantum systems.

Abstract: We propose a variational quantum implementation of self-attention (QSA), the core operation in transformers and large language models, which predicts future elements of a sequence by forming overlap-weighted combinations of past data. At variance with previous approaches, our QSA realizes the required nonlinearity through interference of state overlaps and returns a Renyi-1/2 cross-entropy loss directly as the expectation value of an observable, avoiding the need to decode amplitude-encoded predictions into classical logits. Furthermore, QSA naturally accommodates a constrained, trainable data-embedding that ties quantum state overlaps to data-level similarities. We find a gate complexity dominant scaling O(T d^2) for QSA, versus O(T^2 d) classically, suggesting an advantage in the practical regime where the sequence length T dominates the embedding size d. In simulations, we show that our QSA-based quantum transformer learns sequence prediction on classical data and on many-body transverse-field Ising quantum trajectories, establishing trainable attention as a practical primitive for quantum dynamical modeling.

Abstract: We formulate a geometric framework in which physical laws emerge from restricted access to microscopic information. Measurement constraints are modeled as a gauge symmetry acting on density operators, inducing a gauge-reduced space of physically distinguishable states. In the case of quantum thermodynamics, this construction leads to a gauge-invariant formulation in which the invariant entropy admits a stochastic description and satisfies a general detailed fluctuation theorem. From this result, we derive an integrated fluctuation theorem and a Clausius-like inequality that unifies the first and second laws in terms of invariant work and coherent heat. Entropy production is identified with the relative entropy between forward and backward probability measures on the gauge-reduced space of thermodynamic trajectories, revealing irreversibility as a geometric consequence of limited observability. The third law emerges as a singular zero-temperature limit in which thermodynamic orbits collapse and entropy production vanishes. Since the framework applies to arbitrary information constraints, it encompasses energy-based thermodynamics as a particular case of more general measurement scenarios.

Abstract: In cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), photons leaving the cavity can be irreversibly lost or reused as a power source. This dichotomy is reflected in two different thermodynamic bookkeepings of the light field, both corresponding to valid thermodynamic frameworks. In this work, we formulate a rigorous semi-classical limit of cavity QED and show that the resulting thermodynamic description may qualitatively differ from that of the fully quantised model. We find that violations of the thermodynamic uncertainty relations are recovered in the semi-classical limit only by one of the two thermodynamic frameworks: the one which treats part of the photon flux as a power source. We illustrate our findings in a three-level system coupled to a driven cavity.

Abstract: Efficient and bright single photon sources on photonic chips are key to scaling quantum technologies. Spontaneous four wave mixing in micro-ring resonators creates excellent narrowband and tunable photon sources. We experimentally demonstrate the optimization of heralding efficiency and brightness by tuning the coupling of the pump, signal and idler modes into the resonator whilst operating in a pulsed pump regime. We observe a maximum detected pair rate of over 93,000~coincidences per second in a moderately over-coupled regime, alongside a high intrinsic idler heralding efficiency of 97.87$\pm$8.97\% when operating close to maximal over-coupling. The measured dependence on coupling strength is in strong agreement with theoretical predictions, experimentally validating the predicted trade-off between brightness and heralding efficiency.

Abstract: To reduce circuit depth when executing Quantum algorithms, it is necessary to maximize qubit connectivity on a near-term quantum processor. While addressing this, we also need to ensure high gate fidelity, suppression of unwanted ZZ cross-talk, a compact layout footprint, and minimal control hardware complexity to support scalability. In current superconducting quantum chips, fixed coupling is used as it is easier to scale, but it is limited by unwanted static ZZ interaction during single qubit operations, which degrades system performance. To overcome these challenges, we have introduced a first-of-its-kind hybrid tunable-coupling architecture that connects four fixed-frequency transmon qubits using a single coupler. This hybrid coupler uses off-resonant Stark drives to tune ZZ strength between qubit pairs. Experimentally backed simulation results indicate that our proposed hybrid design maximizes the qubit connectivity while reducing control overhead. This design achieves a near 20% reduction in circuit depth compared to IBM's Heavy-Hexagonal layout, showing its potential for scalability.

Abstract: The realization of distributed quantum neural networks (DQNNs) over quantum internet infrastructures faces fundamental challenges arising from the fragile nature of entanglement and the demanding synchronization requirements of distributed learning. We introduce a Consensus-Entanglement-Aware Scheduling (CEAS) framework that co-designs quantum consensus protocols with adaptive entanglement management to enable robust synchronous training across distributed quantum processors. CEAS integrates fidelity-weighted aggregation, in which parameter updates are weighted by quantum Fisher information to suppress noisy contributions, with decoherence-aware entanglement scheduling that treats Bell pairs as perishable resources subject to exponential decay. The framework incorporates quantum-authenticated Byzantine fault tolerance, ensuring security against malicious nodes while maintaining compatibility with noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) constraints. Our theoretical analysis establishes convergence guarantees under heterogeneous noise conditions, while numerical simulations demonstrate that CEAS maintains 10-15 percentage points higher accuracy compared to entanglement-oblivious baselines under coordinated Byzantine attacks, achieving 90 percent Bell-pair utilization despite coherence time limitations. This work provides a foundational architecture for scalable distributed quantum machine learning, bridging quantum networking, distributed optimization, and early fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer the internal computations of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet separating sparse semantic signals from high-dimensional polysemantic noise remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces the Quantum Sieve Tracer, a hybrid quantum-classical framework designed to characterize factual recall circuits. We implement a modular pipeline that first localizes critical layers using classical causal tracing, then maps specific attention head activations into an exponentially large quantum Hilbert space. Using open-weight models (Meta Llama-3.2-1B and Alibaba Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct), we perform a two-stage analysis that reveals a fundamental architectural divergence. While Qwen's layer 7 circuit functions as a classic Recall Hub, we discover that Llama's layer 9 acts as an Interference Suppression circuit, where ablating the identified heads paradoxically improves factual recall. Our results demonstrate that quantum kernels can distinguish between these constructive (recall) and reductive (suppression) mechanisms, offering a high-resolution tool for analyzing the fine-grained topology of attention.

Abstract: This paper explores the connection between causality and many-body dynamics by studying the algebraic structure of tri-partite unitaries ('walls') which permanently arrest local operator spreading in their time-periodic evolution. We show that the resulting causally independent subsystems arise from the invariance of an embedded sub-algebra in the system (ie. a generalised symmetry) that leads to the splitting of operator space into commuting sub-algebras. The commutant structure of the invariant algebra is then used to construct local conserved quantities. Using representation theory of finite matrix algebras, the general form of wall gates is derived as unitary automorphisms. Taking causal independence as a minimal model for non-ergodic dynamics, we study its effect on probes of many-body quantum chaos. We prove an entanglement area-law due to local constraints and we study its stability against projective measurements. In a random ensemble exhibiting causal independence, we compare spectral correlations with the universal (chaotic) ensemble using the spectral form factor. Our results offer a rigorous understanding of locally constrained quantum dynamics from a quantum information perspective.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit pronounced context-dependent variability that undermines predictable multi-agent behavior in tasks requiring strategic thinking. Focusing on models that range from 7 to 9 billion parameters in size engaged in a ten-round repeated Prisoner's Dilemma, we evaluate whether short, costless pre-play messages emulating the cheap-talk paradigm affect strategic stability. Our analysis uses simulation-level bootstrap resampling and nonparametric inference to compare cooperation trajectories fitted with LOWESS regression across both the messaging and the no-messaging condition. We demonstrate consistent reductions in trajectory noise across a majority of the model-context pairings being studied. The stabilizing effect persists across multiple prompt variants and decoding regimes, though its magnitude depends on model choice and contextual framing, with models displaying higher baseline volatility gaining the most. While communication rarely produces harmful instability, we document a few context-specific exceptions and identify the limited domains in which communication harms stability. These findings position cheap-talk style communication as a low-cost, practical tool for improving the predictability and reliability of strategic behavior in multi-agent LLM systems.

All agents share the singular vector directions while learning distinct spectral masks on singular values. This mechanism encourages inter-agent diversity and preserves scalability. Extensive experiments on both homogeneous (LBF, SMACv2) and heterogeneous (MaMuJoCo) benchmarks show that Prism achieves competitive performance with superior resource efficiency.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) offers a scalable alternative to exact game-theoretic analysis but suffers from non-stationarity and the need to maintain diverse populations of strategies that capture non-transitive interactions. Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) address these issues by iteratively expanding a restricted game with approximate best responses (BRs), yet per-agent BR training makes it prohibitively expensive in many-agent or simulator-expensive settings. We introduce Joint Experience Best Response (JBR), a drop-in modification to PSRO that collects trajectories once under the current meta-strategy profile and reuses this joint dataset to compute BRs for all agents simultaneously. This amortizes environment interaction and improves the sample efficiency of best-response computation. Because JBR converts BR computation into an offline RL problem, we propose three remedies for distribution-shift bias: (i) Conservative JBR with safe policy improvement, (ii) Exploration-Augmented JBR that perturbs data collection and admits theoretical guarantees, and (iii) Hybrid BR that interleaves JBR with periodic independent BR updates. Across benchmark multi-agent environments, Exploration-Augmented JBR achieves the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off, while Hybrid BR attains near-PSRO performance at a fraction of the sample cost. Overall, JBR makes PSRO substantially more practical for large-scale strategic learning while preserving equilibrium robustness.

Abstract: The lightweight semi-supervised learning (LSL) strategy provides an effective approach of conserving labeled samples and minimizing model inference costs. Prior research has effectively applied knowledge transfer learning and co-training regularization from large to small models in LSL. However, such training strategies are computationally intensive and prone to local optima, thereby increasing the difficulty of finding the optimal solution. This has prompted us to investigate the feasibility of integrating three low-cost scenarios for text mining tasks: limited labeled supervision, lightweight fine-tuning, and rapid-inference small models. We propose NanoNet, a novel framework for lightweight text mining that implements parameter-efficient learning with limited supervision. It employs online knowledge distillation to generate multiple small models and enhances their performance through mutual learning regularization. The entire process leverages parameter-efficient learning, reducing training costs and minimizing supervision requirements, ultimately yielding a lightweight model for downstream inference.

Abstract: Predictive confidence serves as a foundational control signal in mission-critical systems, directly governing risk-aware logic such as escalation, abstention, and conservative fallback. While prior federated learning attacks predominantly target accuracy or implant backdoors, we identify confidence calibration as a distinct attack objective. We present the Temperature Scaling Attack (TSA), a training-time attack that degrades calibration while preserving accuracy. By injecting temperature scaling with learning rate-temperature coupling during local training, malicious updates maintain benign-like optimization behavior, evading accuracy-based monitoring and similarity-based detection. We provide a convergence analysis under non-IID settings, showing that this coupling preserves standard convergence bounds while systematically distorting confidence. Across three benchmarks, TSA substantially shifts calibration (e.g., 145% error increase on CIFAR-100) with <2 accuracy change, and remains effective under robust aggregation and post-hoc calibration defenses. Case studies further show that confidence manipulation can cause up to 7.2x increases in missed critical cases (healthcare) or false alarms (autonomous driving), even when accuracy is unchanged. Overall, our results establish calibration integrity as a critical attack surface in federated learning.

Abstract: Wind power ramp events are difficult to forecast due to strong variability, multi-scale dynamics, and site-specific meteorological effects. This paper proposes an event-first, frequency-aware forecasting paradigm that directly predicts ramp events and reconstructs the power trajectory thereafter, rather than inferring events from dense forecasts. The framework is built on an enhanced Ramping Behaviour Analysis (RBA$_θ$) method's event representation and progressively integrates statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models. Traditional forecasting models with post-hoc event extraction provides a strong interpretable baseline but exhibits limited generalisation across sites. Direct event prediction using Random Forests improves robustness over survival-based formulations, motivating fully event-aware modelling. To capture the multi-scale nature of wind ramps, we introduce an event-first deep architecture that integrates wavelet-based frequency decomposition, temporal excitation features, and adaptive feature selection. The resulting sequence models enable stable long-horizon event prediction, physically consistent trajectory reconstruction, and zero-shot transfer to previously unseen wind farms. Empirical analysis shows that ramp magnitude and duration are governed by distinct mid-frequency bands, allowing accurate signal reconstruction from sparse event forecasts. An agentic forecasting layer is proposed, in which specialised workflows are selected dynamically based on operational context. Together, the framework demonstrates that event-first, frequency-aware forecasting provides a transferable and operationally aligned alternative to trajectory-first wind-power prediction.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) are powerful generators driven by statistical next-token prediction. While effective at producing fluent text, this design biases models toward high-probability continuations rather than exhaustive and faithful answers grounded in source content. As a result, directly applying LLMs lacks systematic mechanisms to ensure both completeness (avoiding omissions) and faithfulness (avoiding unsupported content), which fundamentally conflicts with core AI safety principles. To address this limitation, we present EVE, a structured framework for document-grounded reasoning.
  Unlike free-form prompting, EVE constrains generation to a structured, verifiable pipeline that decomposes high-rigor reasoning into extraction, validation, and enumeration. Empirically, this design enables consistent and simultaneous improvements in recall, precision, and F1-score: recall and precision increase by up to 24\% and 29\%, respectively, with a corresponding 31\% gain in F1-score. This effectively breaks the long-standing trade-off between coverage and accuracy typical of single-pass LLM generation, while also mitigating generation truncation caused by length limitations. At the same time, we emphasize that EVE exhibits performance saturation due to the inherent ambiguity of natural language, reflecting fundamental limits of language-based reasoning.

Abstract: Game balancing is a longstanding challenge requiring repeated playtesting, expert intuition, and extensive manual tuning. We introduce RuleSmith, the first framework that achieves automated game balancing by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of multi-agent LLMs. It couples a game engine, multi-agent LLMs self-play, and Bayesian optimization operating over a multi-dimensional rule space. As a proof of concept, we instantiate RuleSmith on CivMini, a simplified civilization-style game containing heterogeneous factions, economy systems, production rules, and combat mechanics, all governed by tunable parameters. LLM agents interpret textual rulebooks and game states to generate actions, to conduct fast evaluation of balance metrics such as win-rate disparities. To search the parameter landscape efficiently, we integrate Bayesian optimization with acquisition-based adaptive sampling and discrete projection: promising candidates receive more evaluation games for accurate assessment, while exploratory candidates receive fewer games for efficient exploration. Experiments show that RuleSmith converges to highly balanced configurations and provides interpretable rule adjustments that can be directly applied to downstream game systems. Our results illustrate that LLM simulation can serve as a powerful surrogate for automating design and balancing in complex multi-agent environments.

Abstract: Many engineering and scientific workflows depend on expensive black-box evaluations, requiring decision-making that simultaneously improves performance and reduces uncertainty. Bayesian optimization (BO) and Bayesian experimental design (BED) offer powerful yet largely separate treatments of goal-seeking and information-seeking, providing limited guidance for hybrid settings where learning and optimization are intrinsically coupled. We propose "pragmatic curiosity," a hybrid learning-optimization paradigm derived from active inference, in which actions are selected by minimizing the expected free energy--a single objective that couples pragmatic utility with epistemic information gain. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness and flexibility of pragmatic curiosity on various real-world hybrid tasks, including constrained system identification, targeted active search, and composite optimization with unknown preferences. Across these benchmarks, pragmatic curiosity consistently outperforms strong BO-type and BED-type baselines, delivering higher estimation accuracy, better critical-region coverage, and improved final solution quality.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is a representative multi-agent coordination problem, where multiple agents are required to navigate to their respective goals without collisions. Solving MAPF optimally is known to be NP-hard, leading to the adoption of learning-based approaches to alleviate the online computational burden. Prevailing approaches, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), are typically constrained to pairwise message passing between agents. However, this limitation leads to suboptimal behaviours and critical issues, such as attention dilution, particularly in dense environments where group (i.e. beyond just two agents) coordination is most critical. Despite the importance of such higher-order interactions, existing approaches have not been able to fully explore them. To address this representational bottleneck, we introduce HMAGAT (Hypergraph Multi-Agent Attention Network), a novel architecture that leverages attentional mechanisms over directed hypergraphs to explicitly capture group dynamics. Empirically, HMAGAT establishes a new state-of-the-art among learning-based MAPF solvers: e.g., despite having just 1M parameters and being trained on 100$\times$ less data, it outperforms the current SoTA 85M parameter model. Through detailed analysis of HMAGAT's attention values, we demonstrate how hypergraph representations mitigate the attention dilution inherent in GNNs and capture complex interactions where pairwise methods fail. Our results illustrate that appropriate inductive biases are often more critical than the training data size or sheer parameter count for multi-agent problems.

Abstract: Machine learning in clinical settings must balance predictive accuracy, interpretability, and privacy. Models such as logistic regression (LR) offer transparency, while neural networks (NNs) provide greater predictive power; yet both remain vulnerable to privacy attacks. We empirically assess these risks by designing attacks that identify which public datasets were used to train a model under varying levels of adversarial access, applying them to LORIS, a publicly available LR model for immunotherapy response prediction, as well as to additional shallow NN models trained for the same task. Our results show that both models leak significant training-set information, with LRs proving particularly vulnerable in white-box scenarios. Moreover, we observe that common practices such as cross-validation in LRs exacerbate these risks. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, we propose a quantum-inspired defense based on tensorizing discretized models into tensor trains (TTs), which fully obfuscates parameters while preserving accuracy, reducing white-box attacks to random guessing and degrading black-box attacks comparably to Differential Privacy. TT models retain LR interpretability and extend it through efficient computation of marginal and conditional distributions, while also enabling this higher level of interpretability for NNs. Our results demonstrate that tensorization is widely applicable and establishes a practical foundation for private, interpretable, and effective clinical prediction.

Abstract: Bayesian optimal experimental design (BOED) seeks to maximize the expected information gain (EIG) of experiments. This requires a likelihood estimate, which in many settings is intractable. Simulation-based inference (SBI) provides powerful tools for this regime. However, existing work explicitly connecting SBI and BOED is restricted to a single contrastive EIG bound. We show that the EIG admits multiple formulations which can directly leverage modern SBI density estimators, encompassing neural posterior, likelihood, and ratio estimation. Building on this perspective, we define a novel EIG estimator using neural likelihood estimation. Further, we identify optimization as a key bottleneck of gradient based EIG maximization and show that a simple multi-start parallel gradient ascent procedure can substantially improve reliability and performance. With these innovations, our SBI-based BOED methods are able to match or outperform by up to $22\%$ existing state-of-the-art approaches across standard BOED benchmarks.

Abstract: The high computational demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) motivate methods that reduce parameter count and accelerate inference. In response, model pruning emerges as an effective strategy, yet current methods typically focus on a single dimension-depth or width. We introduce MoP (Mixture of Pruners), an iterative framework that unifies these dimensions. At each iteration, MoP generates two branches-pruning in depth versus pruning in width-and selects a candidate to advance the path. On LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3, MoP advances the frontier of structured pruning, exceeding the accuracy of competing methods across a broad set of compression regimes. It also consistently outperforms depth-only and width-only pruning. Furthermore, MoP translates structural pruning into real speedup, reducing end-to-end latency by 39% at 40% compression. Finally, extending MoP to the vision-language model LLaVA-1.5, we notably improve computational efficiency and demonstrate that text-only recovery fine-tuning can restore performance even on visual tasks.

Abstract: Online strategic classification studies settings in which agents strategically modify their features to obtain favorable predictions. For example, given a classifier that determines loan approval based on credit scores, applicants may open or close credit cards and bank accounts to obtain a positive prediction. The learning goal is to achieve low mistake or regret bounds despite such strategic behavior.
  While randomized algorithms have the potential to offer advantages to the learner in strategic settings, they have been largely underexplored. In the realizable setting, no lower bound is known for randomized algorithms, and existing lower bound constructions for deterministic learners can be circumvented by randomization. In the agnostic setting, the best known regret upper bound is $O(T^{3/4}\log^{1/4}T|\mathcal H|)$, which is far from the standard online learning rate of $O(\sqrt{T\log|\mathcal H|})$.
  In this work, we provide refined bounds for online strategic classification in both settings. In the realizable setting, we extend, for $T > \mathrm{Ldim}(\mathcal{H}) Δ^2$, the existing lower bound $Ω(\mathrm{Ldim}(\mathcal{H}) Δ)$ for deterministic learners to all learners. This yields the first lower bound that applies to randomized learners. We also provide the first randomized learner that improves the known (deterministic) upper bound of $O(\mathrm{Ldim}(\mathcal H) \cdot Δ\log Δ)$.
  In the agnostic setting, we give a proper learner using convex optimization techniques to improve the regret upper bound to $O(\sqrt{T \log |\mathcal{H}|} + |\mathcal{H}| \log(T|\mathcal{H}|))$. We show a matching lower bound up to logarithmic factors for all proper learning rules, demonstrating the optimality of our learner among proper learners. As such, improper learning is necessary to further improve regret guarantees.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for verifying properties of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), a class of neural networks characterized by nonlinear, univariate activation functions typically implemented as piecewise polynomial splines or Gaussian processes. Our method creates mathematical ``abstractions'' by replacing each KAN unit with a piecewise affine (PWA) function, providing both local and global error estimates between the original network and its approximation. These abstractions enable property verification by encoding the problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP), determining whether outputs satisfy specified properties when inputs belong to a given set. A critical challenge lies in balancing the number of pieces in the PWA approximation: too many pieces add binary variables that make verification computationally intractable, while too few pieces create excessive error margins that yield uninformative bounds. Our key contribution is a systematic framework that exploits KAN structure to find optimal abstractions. By combining dynamic programming at the unit level with a knapsack optimization across the network, we minimize the total number of pieces while guaranteeing specified error bounds. This approach determines the optimal approximation strategy for each unit while maintaining overall accuracy requirements. Empirical evaluation across multiple KAN benchmarks demonstrates that the upfront analysis costs of our method are justified by superior verification results.

Abstract: Climate hazards increasingly disrupt urban transportation and emergency-response operations by damaging housing stock, degrading infrastructure, and reducing network accessibility. This paper presents Skjold-DiT, a diffusion-transformer framework that integrates heterogeneous spatio-temporal urban data to forecast building-level climate-risk indicators while explicitly incorporating transportation-network structure and accessibility signals relevant to intelligent vehicles (e.g., emergency reachability and evacuation-route constraints). Concretely, Skjold-DiT enables hazard-conditioned routing constraints by producing calibrated, uncertainty-aware accessibility layers (reachability, travel-time inflation, and route redundancy) that can be consumed by intelligent-vehicle routing and emergency dispatch systems. Skjold-DiT combines: (1) Fjell-Prompt, a prompt-based conditioning interface designed to support cross-city transfer; (2) Norrland-Fusion, a cross-modal attention mechanism unifying hazard maps/imagery, building attributes, demographics, and transportation infrastructure into a shared latent representation; and (3) Valkyrie-Forecast, a counterfactual simulator for generating probabilistic risk trajectories under intervention prompts. We introduce the Baltic-Caspian Urban Resilience (BCUR) dataset with 847,392 building-level observations across six cities, including multi-hazard annotations (e.g., flood and heat indicators) and transportation accessibility features. Experiments evaluate prediction quality, cross-city generalization, calibration, and downstream transportation-relevant outcomes, including reachability and hazard-conditioned travel times under counterfactual interventions.

Abstract: Learning to play zero-sum games is a fundamental problem in game theory and machine learning. While significant progress has been made in minimizing external regret in the self-play settings or with full-information feedback, real-world applications often force learners to play against unknown, arbitrary opponents and restrict learners to bandit feedback where only the payoff of the realized action is observable. In such challenging settings, it is well-known that $Ω(\sqrt{T})$ external regret is unavoidable (where T is the number of rounds). To overcome this barrier, we investigate adversarial learning in zero-sum games under bandit feedback, aiming to minimize the deficit against the maximin pure strategy -- a metric we term Pure-Strategy Maximin Regret.
  We analyze this problem under two bandit feedback models: uninformed (only the realized reward is revealed) and informed (both the reward and the opponent's action are revealed). For uninformed bandit learning of normal-form games, we show that the Tsallis-INF algorithm achieves $O(c \log T)$ instance-dependent regret with a game-dependent parameter $c$. Crucially, we prove an information-theoretic lower bound showing that the dependence on c is necessary. To overcome this hardness, we turn to the informed setting and introduce Maximin-UCB, which obtains another regret bound of the form $O(c' \log T)$ for a different game-dependent parameter $c'$ that could potentially be much smaller than $c$. Finally, we generalize both results to bilinear games over an arbitrary, large action set, proposing Tsallis-FTRL-SPM and Maximin-LinUCB for the uninformed and informed setting respectively and establishing similar game-dependent logarithmic regret bounds.

Abstract: Internal modelling of the world -- predicting transitions between previous states $X$ and next states $Y$ under actions $Z$ -- is essential to reasoning and planning for LLMs and VLMs. Learning such models typically requires costly action-labelled trajectories. We propose SWIRL, a self-improvement framework that learns from state-only sequences by treating actions as a latent variable and alternating between Forward World Modelling (FWM) $P_θ(Y|X,Z)$ and an Inverse Dynamics Modelling (IDM) $Q_φ(Z|X,Y)$. SWIRL iterates two phases: (1) Variational Information Maximisation, which updates the FWM to generate next states that maximise conditional mutual information with latent actions given prior states, encouraging identifiable consistency; and (2) ELBO Maximisation, which updates the IDM to explain observed transitions, effectively performing coordinate ascent. Both models are trained with reinforcement learning (specifically, GRPO) with the opposite frozen model's log-probability as a reward signal. We provide theoretical learnability guarantees for both updates, and evaluate SWIRL on LLMs and VLMs across multiple environments: single-turn and multi-turn open-world visual dynamics and synthetic textual environments for physics, web, and tool calling. SWIRL achieves gains of 16% on AURORABench, 28% on ByteMorph, 16% on WorldPredictionBench, and 14% on StableToolBench.

Abstract: We study the online resource allocation problem in which at each round, a budget $B$ must be allocated across $K$ arms under censored feedback. An arm yields a reward if and only if two conditions are satisfied: (i) the arm is activated according to an arm-specific Bernoulli random variable with unknown parameter, and (ii) the allocated budget exceeds a random threshold drawn from a parametric distribution with unknown parameter. Over $T$ rounds, the learner must jointly estimate the unknown parameters and allocate the budget so as to maximize cumulative reward facing the exploration--exploitation trade-off. We prove an information-theoretic regret lower bound $Ω(T^{1/3})$, demonstrating the intrinsic difficulty of the problem. We then propose RA-UCB, an optimistic algorithm that leverages non-trivial parameter estimation and confidence bounds. When the budget $B$ is known at the beginning of each round, RA-UCB achieves a regret of order $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$, and even $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{poly}\text{-}\log T)$ under stronger assumptions. As for unknown, round dependent budget, we introduce MG-UCB, which allows within-round switching and infinitesimal allocations, and matches the regret guarantees of RA-UCB. We then validate our theoretical results through experiments on real-world datasets.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a compelling remedy for machine learning (ML) models that degrade under domain shifts, improving generalisation on-the-fly with only unlabelled samples. This flexibility suits real deployments, yet conventional evaluations unrealistically assume unbounded processing time, overlooking the accuracy-latency trade-off. As ML increasingly underpins latency-sensitive and user-facing use-cases, temporal pressure constrains the viability of adaptable inference; predictions arriving too late to act on are futile. We introduce Tempora, a framework for evaluating TTA under this pressure. It consists of temporal scenarios that model deployment constraints, evaluation protocols that operationalise measurement, and time-contingent utility metrics that quantify the accuracy-latency trade-off. We instantiate the framework with three such metrics: (1) discrete utility for asynchronous streams with hard deadlines, (2) continuous utility for interactive settings where value decays with latency, and (3) amortised utility for budget-constrained deployments. Applying Tempora to seven TTA methods on ImageNet-C across 240 temporal evaluations reveals rank instability: conventional rankings do not predict rankings under temporal pressure; ETA, a state-of-the-art method in the conventional setting, falls short in 41.2% of evaluations. The highest-utility method varies with corruption type and temporal pressure, with no clear winner. By enabling systematic evaluation across diverse temporal constraints for the first time, Tempora reveals when and why rankings invert, offering practitioners a lens for method selection and researchers a target for deployable adaptation.

Abstract: Generative policies based on diffusion models and flow matching have shown strong promise for offline reinforcement learning (RL), but their applicability remains largely confined to continuous action spaces. To address a broader range of offline RL settings, we extend flow matching to a general framework that supports discrete action spaces with multiple objectives. Specifically, we replace continuous flows with continuous-time Markov chains, trained using a Q-weighted flow matching objective. We then extend our design to multi-agent settings, mitigating the exponential growth of joint action spaces via a factorized conditional path. We theoretically show that, under idealized conditions, optimizing this objective recovers the optimal policy. Extensive experiments further demonstrate that our method performs robustly in practical scenarios, including high-dimensional control, multi-modal decision-making, and dynamically changing preferences over multiple objectives. Our discrete framework can also be applied to continuous-control problems through action quantization, providing a flexible trade-off between representational complexity and performance.

Abstract: In recent work it is shown that Q-learning with linear function approximation is stable, in the sense of bounded parameter estimates, under the $(\varepsilon,κ)$-tamed Gibbs policy; $κ$ is inverse temperature, and $\varepsilon>0$ is introduced for additional exploration. Under these assumptions it also follows that there is a solution to the projected Bellman equation (PBE). Left open is uniqueness of the solution, and criteria for convergence outside of the standard tabular or linear MDP settings.
  The present work extends these results to other variants of Q-learning, and clarifies prior work: a one dimensional example shows that under an oblivious policy for training there may be no solution to the PBE, or multiple solutions, and in each case the algorithm is not stable under oblivious training.
  The main contribution is that far more structure is required for convergence. An example is presented for which the basis is ideal, in the sense that the true Q-function is in the span of the basis. However, there are two solutions to the PBE under the greedy policy, and hence also for the $(\varepsilon,κ)$-tamed Gibbs policy for all sufficiently small $\varepsilon>0$ and $κ\ge 1$.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale large language models efficiently by sparsely activating experts, but once an expert is selected, it is executed fully. Hence, the trade-off between accuracy and computation in an MoE model typically exhibits large discontinuities. We propose Mixture of Slimmable Experts (MoSE), an MoE architecture in which each expert has a nested, slimmable structure that can be executed at variable widths. This enables conditional computation not only over which experts are activated, but also over how much of each expert is utilized. Consequently, a single pretrained MoSE model can support a more continuous spectrum of accuracy-compute trade-offs at inference time. We present a simple and stable training recipe for slimmable experts under sparse routing, combining multi-width training with standard MoE objectives. During inference, we explore strategies for runtime width determination, including a lightweight test-time training mechanism that learns how to map router confidence/probabilities to expert widths under a fixed budget. Experiments on GPT models trained on OpenWebText demonstrate that MoSE matches or improves upon standard MoE at full width and consistently shifts the Pareto frontier for accuracy vs. cost, achieving comparable performance with significantly fewer FLOPs.

Abstract: Diffusion models rely on a high-dimensional latent space of initial noise seeds, yet it remains unclear whether this space contains sufficient structure to predict properties of the generated samples, such as their classes. In this work, we investigate the emergence of latent structure through the lens of confidence scores assigned by a pre-trained classifier to generated samples. We show that while the latent space appears largely unstructured when considering all noise realizations, restricting attention to initial noise seeds that produce high-confidence samples reveals pronounced class separability. By comparing class predictability across noise subsets of varying confidence and examining the class separability of the latent space, we find evidence of class-relevant latent structure that becomes observable only under confidence-based filtering. As a practical implication, we discuss how confidence-based filtering enables conditional generation as an alternative to guidance-based methods.

Abstract: DNA storage has matured from concept to practical stage, yet its integration with neural compression pipelines remains inefficient. Early DNA encoders applied redundancy-heavy constraint layers atop raw binary data - workable but primitive. Recent neural codecs compress data into learned latent representations with rich statistical structure, yet still convert these latents to DNA via naive binary-to-quaternary transcoding, discarding the entropy model's optimization. This mismatch undermines compression efficiency and complicates the encoding stack. A plug-in module that collapses latent compression and DNA encoding into a single step. SCONE performs quaternary arithmetic coding directly on the latent space in DNA bases. Its Constraint-Aware Adaptive Coding module dynamically steers the entropy encoder's learned probability distribution to enforce biochemical constraints - Guanine-Cytosine (GC) balance and homopolymer suppression - deterministically during encoding, eliminating post-hoc correction. The design preserves full reversibility and exploits the hyperprior model's learned priors without modification. Experiments show SCONE achieves near-perfect constraint satisfaction with negligible computational overhead (<2% latency), establishing a latent-agnostic interface for end-to-end DNA-compatible learned codecs.

Abstract: Trainings of Large Language Models are generally bottlenecked by matrix multiplications. In the Transformer architecture, a large portion of these operations happens in the Feed Forward Network (FFN), and this portion increases for larger models, up to 50% of the total pretraining floating point operations. We show that we can leverage hardware-accelerated sparsity to accelerate all matrix multiplications in the FFN, with 2:4 sparsity for weights and v:n:m (Venom) sparsity for activations. Our recipe relies on sparse training steps to accelerate a large part of the pretraining, associated with regular dense training steps towards the end. Overall, models trained with this approach exhibit the same performance on our quality benchmarks, and can speed up training end-to-end by 1.4 to 1.7x. This approach is applicable to all NVIDIA GPUs starting with the A100 generation, and is orthogonal to common optimization techniques, such as, quantization, and can also be applied to mixture-of-experts model architectures.

Abstract: Centralized training is the standard paradigm in deep learning, enabling models to learn from a unified dataset in a single location. In such setup, isotropic feature distributions naturally arise as a mean to support well-structured and generalizable representations. In contrast, continual learning operates on streaming and non-stationary data, and trains models incrementally, inherently facing the well-known plasticity-stability dilemma. In such settings, learning dynamics tends to yield increasingly anisotropic feature space. This arises a fundamental question: should isotropy be enforced to achieve a better balance between stability and plasticity, and thereby mitigate catastrophic forgetting? In this paper, we investigate whether promoting feature-space isotropy can enhance representation quality in continual learning. Through experiments using contrastive continual learning techniques on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 data, we find that isotropic regularization fails to improve, and can in fact degrade, model accuracy in continual settings. Our results highlight essential differences in feature geometry between centralized and continual learning, suggesting that isotropy, while beneficial in centralized setups, may not constitute an appropriate inductive bias for non-stationary learning scenarios.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for collaborative machine learning across decentralized data sources, preserving privacy by keeping data local. However, increasing legal and ethical demands, such as the "right to be forgotten", and the need to mitigate data poisoning attacks have underscored the urgent necessity for principled data unlearning in FL. Unlike centralized settings, the distributed nature of FL complicates the removal of individual data contributions. In this paper, we propose a novel federated unlearning framework formulated as a min-max optimization problem, where the objective is to maximize an $f$-divergence between the model trained with all data and the model retrained without specific data points, while minimizing the degradation on retained data. Our framework could act like a plugin and be added to almost any federated setup, unlike SOTA methods like (\cite{10269017} which requires model degradation in server, or \cite{khalil2025notfederatedunlearningweight} which requires to involve model architecture and model weights). This formulation allows for efficient approximation of data removal effects in a federated setting. We provide empirical evaluations to show that our method achieves significant speedups over naive retraining, with minimal impact on utility.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a standard tool for parameter-efficient finetuning of large models. While it induces a small memory footprint, its training dynamics can be surprisingly complex as they depend on several hyperparameters such as initialization, adapter rank, and learning rate. In particular, it is unclear how the optimal learning rate scales with adapter rank, which forces practitioners to re-tune the learning rate whenever the rank is changed. In this paper, we introduce Maximal-Update Adaptation ($μ$A), a theoretical framework that characterizes how the "optimal" learning rate should scale with model width and adapter rank to produce stable, non-vanishing feature updates under standard configurations. $μ$A is inspired from the Maximal-Update Parametrization ($μ$P) in pretraining. Our analysis leverages techniques from hyperparameter transfer and reveals that the optimal learning rate exhibits different scaling patterns depending on initialization and LoRA scaling factor. Specifically, we identify two regimes: one where the optimal learning rate remains roughly invariant across ranks, and another where it scales inversely with rank. We further identify a configuration that allows learning rate transfer from LoRA to full finetuning, drastically reducing the cost of learning rate tuning for full finetuning. Experiments across language, vision, vision--language, image generation, and reinforcement learning tasks validate our scaling rules and show that learning rates tuned on LoRA transfer reliably to full finetuning.

Abstract: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that independently trained neural networks converge to increasingly similar latent spaces. However, current strategies for mapping these representations are inherently pairwise, scaling quadratically with the number of models and failing to yield a consistent global reference. In this paper, we study the alignment of $M \ge 3$ models. We first adapt Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA) to construct a shared orthogonal universe that preserves the internal geometry essential for tasks like model stitching. We then show that strict isometric alignment is suboptimal for retrieval, where agreement-maximizing methods like Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) typically prevail. To bridge this gap, we finally propose Geometry-Corrected Procrustes Alignment (GCPA), which establishes a robust GPA-based universe followed by a post-hoc correction for directional mismatch. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GCPA consistently improves any-to-any retrieval while retaining a practical shared reference space.

Abstract: Recent empirical evidence has demonstrated that the training dynamics of large-scale deep neural networks occur within low-dimensional subspaces. While this has inspired new research into low-rank training, compression, and adaptation, theoretical justification for these dynamics in nonlinear networks remains limited. %compared to deep linear settings. To address this gap, this paper analyzes the learning dynamics of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) under gradient descent (GD). We demonstrate that the weight dynamics concentrate within invariant low-dimensional subspaces throughout training. Theoretically, we precisely characterize these invariant subspaces for two-layer networks with smooth nonlinear activations, providing insight into their emergence. Experimentally, we validate that this phenomenon extends beyond our theoretical assumptions. Leveraging these insights, we empirically show there exists a low-rank MLP parameterization that, when initialized within the appropriate subspaces, matches the classification performance of fully-parameterized counterparts on a variety of classification tasks.

Abstract: The growth of machine learning demands interpretable models for critical applications, yet most high-performing models are ``black-box'' systems that obscure input-output relationships, while traditional rule-based algorithms like RuleFit suffer from a lack of predictive power and instability despite their simplicity. This motivated our development of Sparse Relaxed Regularized Regression Rule-Fit (SR4-Fit), a novel interpretable classification algorithm that addresses these limitations while maintaining superior classification performance. Using demographic characteristics of U.S. congressional districts from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, we demonstrate that SR4-Fit can predict House election party outcomes with unprecedented accuracy and interpretability. Our results show that while the majority party remains the strongest predictor, SR4-Fit has revealed intrinsic combinations of demographic factors that affect prediction outcomes that were unable to be interpreted in black-box algorithms such as random forests. The SR4-Fit algorithm surpasses both black-box models and existing interpretable rule-based algorithms such as RuleFit with respect to accuracy, simplicity, and robustness, generating stable and interpretable rule sets while maintaining superior predictive performance, thus addressing the traditional trade-off between model interpretability and predictive capability in electoral forecasting. To further validate SR4-Fit's performance, we also apply it to six additional publicly available classification datasets, like the breast cancer, Ecoli, page blocks, Pima Indians, vehicle, and yeast datasets, and find similar results.

Abstract: We introduce PEPO (Pessimistic Ensemble based Preference Optimization), a single-step Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)-like algorithm to mitigate the well-known over-optimization issue in preference learning without requiring the knowledge of the data-generating distribution or learning an explicit reward model. PEPO achieves pessimism via an ensemble of preference-optimized policies trained on disjoint data subsets and then aggregates them through a worst case construction that favors the agreement across models. In the tabular setting, PEPO achieves sample complexity guarantees depending only on a single-policy concentrability coefficient, thus avoiding the all-policy concentrability which affects the guarantees of algorithms prone to over-optimization, such as DPO. The theoretical findings are corroborated by a convincing practical performance, while retaining the simplicity and the practicality of DPO-style training.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations offer an intuitive way to interpret graph neural networks (GNNs) by identifying minimal changes that alter a model's prediction, thereby answering "what must differ for a different outcome?". In this work, we propose a novel framework, ATEX-CF that unifies adversarial attack techniques with counterfactual explanation generation-a connection made feasible by their shared goal of flipping a node's prediction, yet differing in perturbation strategy: adversarial attacks often rely on edge additions, while counterfactual methods typically use deletions. Unlike traditional approaches that treat explanation and attack separately, our method efficiently integrates both edge additions and deletions, grounded in theory, leveraging adversarial insights to explore impactful counterfactuals. In addition, by jointly optimizing fidelity, sparsity, and plausibility under a constrained perturbation budget, our method produces instance-level explanations that are both informative and realistic. Experiments on synthetic and real-world node classification benchmarks demonstrate that ATEX-CF generates faithful, concise, and plausible explanations, highlighting the effectiveness of integrating adversarial insights into counterfactual reasoning for GNNs.

Abstract: High-fidelity simulations of laser welding capture complex thermo-fluid phenomena, including phase change, free-surface deformation, and keyhole dynamics, however their computational cost limits large-scale process exploration and real-time use. In this work we present the Laser Processing Fourier Neural Operator (LP-FNO), a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) based surrogate model that learns the parametric solution operator of various laser processes from multiphysics simulations generated with FLOW-3D WELD (registered trademark). Through a novel approach of reformulating the transient problem in the moving laser frame and applying temporal averaging, the system results in a quasi-steady state setting suitable for operator learning, even in the keyhole welding regime. The proposed LP-FNO maps process parameters to three-dimensional temperature fields and melt-pool boundaries across a broad process window spanning conduction and keyhole regimes using the non-dimensional normalized enthalpy formulation. The model achieves temperature prediction errors on the order of 1% and intersection-over-union scores for melt-pool segmentation over 0.9. We demonstrate that a LP-FNO model trained on coarse-resolution data can be evaluated on finer grids, yielding accurate super-resolved predictions in mesh-converged conduction regimes, whereas discrepancies in keyhole regimes reflect unresolved dynamics in the coarse-mesh training data. These results indicate that the LP-FNO provides an efficient surrogate modeling framework for laser welding, enabling prediction of full three-dimensional fields and phase interfaces over wide parameter ranges in just tens of milliseconds, up to a hundred thousand times faster than traditional Finite Volume multi-physics software.

Abstract: We consider the problem of exactly learning an $s$-sparse real-valued Boolean polynomial of degree $d$ of the form $f:\{ 0,1\}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. This problem corresponds to decomposing functions in the AND basis and is known as taking a Möbius transform. While the analogous problem for the parity basis (Fourier transform) $f: \{-1,1 \}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is well-understood, the AND basis presents a unique challenge: the basis vectors are coherent, precluding standard compressed sensing methods. We overcome this challenge by identifying that we can exploit adaptive group testing to provide a constructive, query-efficient implementation of the Möbius transform (also known as Möbius inversion) for sparse functions. We present two algorithms based on this insight. The Fully-Adaptive Sparse Möbius Transform (FASMT) uses $O(sd \log(n/d))$ adaptive queries in $O((sd + n) sd \log(n/d))$ time, which we show is near-optimal in query complexity. Furthermore, we also present the Partially-Adaptive Sparse Möbius Transform (PASMT), which uses $O(sd^2\log(n/d))$ queries, trading a factor of $d$ to reduce the number of adaptive rounds to $O(d^2\log(n/d))$, with no dependence on $s$. When applied to hypergraph reconstruction from edge-count queries, our results improve upon baselines by avoiding the combinatorial explosion in the rank $d$. We demonstrate the practical utility of our method for hypergraph reconstruction by applying it to learning real hypergraphs in simulations.

Abstract: Machine unlearning for LLMs aims to remove sensitive or copyrighted data from trained models. However, the true efficacy of current unlearning methods remains uncertain. Standard evaluation metrics rely on benign queries that often mistake superficial information suppression for genuine knowledge removal. Such metrics fail to detect residual knowledge that more sophisticated prompting strategies could still extract. We introduce REBEL, an evolutionary approach for adversarial prompt generation designed to probe whether unlearned data can still be recovered. Our experiments demonstrate that REBEL successfully elicits ``forgotten'' knowledge from models that seemed to be forgotten in standard unlearning benchmarks, revealing that current unlearning methods may provide only a superficial layer of protection. We validate our framework on subsets of the TOFU and WMDP benchmarks, evaluating performance across a diverse suite of unlearning algorithms. Our experiments show that REBEL consistently outperforms static baselines, recovering ``forgotten'' knowledge with Attack Success Rates (ASRs) reaching up to 60% on TOFU and 93% on WMDP. We will make all code publicly available upon acceptance. Code is available at https://github.com/patryk-rybak/REBEL/

Abstract: Model steering, which involves intervening on hidden representations at inference time, has emerged as a lightweight alternative to finetuning for precisely controlling large language models. While steering efficacy has been widely studied, evaluations of whether interventions alter only the intended property remain limited, especially with respect to unintended changes in behaviors related to the target property. We call this notion specificity. We propose a framework that distinguishes three dimensions of specificity: general (preserving fluency and unrelated abilities), control (preserving related control properties), and robustness (preserving control properties under distribution shifts). We study two safety-critical use cases: steering models to reduce overrefusal and faithfulness hallucinations, and show that while steering achieves high efficacy and largely maintains general and control specificity, it consistently fails to preserve robustness specificity. In the case of overrefusal steering, for example, all steering methods reduce overrefusal without harming general abilities and refusal on harmful queries; however, they substantially increase vulnerability to jailbreaks. Our work provides the first systematic evaluation of specificity in model steering, showing that standard efficacy and specificity checks are insufficient, because without robustness evaluation, steering methods may appear reliable even when they compromise model safety.

Abstract: Safety alignment is only as robust as its weakest failure mode. Despite extensive work on safety post-training, it has been shown that models can be readily unaligned through post-deployment fine-tuning. However, these methods often require extensive data curation and degrade model utility.
  In this work, we extend the practical limits of unalignment by introducing GRP-Obliteration (GRP-Oblit), a method that uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to directly remove safety constraints from target models. We show that a single unlabeled prompt is sufficient to reliably unalign safety-aligned models while largely preserving their utility, and that GRP-Oblit achieves stronger unalignment on average than existing state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, GRP-Oblit generalizes beyond language models and can also unalign diffusion-based image generation systems.
  We evaluate GRP-Oblit on six utility benchmarks and five safety benchmarks across fifteen 7-20B parameter models, spanning instruct and reasoning models, as well as dense and MoE architectures. The evaluated model families include GPT-OSS, distilled DeepSeek, Gemma, Llama, Ministral, and Qwen.

Abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing different notions of swap regret in online optimization. These forms of regret are tightly connected to correlated equilibrium concepts in games, and have been more recently shown to guarantee non-manipulability against strategic adversaries. The only computationally efficient algorithm for minimizing linear swap regret over a general convex set in $\mathbb{R}^d$ was developed recently by Daskalakis, Farina, Fishelson, Pipis, and Schneider (STOC '25). However, it incurs a highly suboptimal regret bound of $Ω(d^4 \sqrt{T})$ and also relies on computationally intensive calls to the ellipsoid algorithm at each iteration.
  In this paper, we develop a significantly simpler, computationally efficient algorithm that guarantees $O(d^{3/2} \sqrt{T})$ linear swap regret for a general convex set and $O(d \sqrt{T})$ when the set is centrally symmetric. Our approach leverages the powerful response-based approachability framework of Bernstein and Shimkin (JMLR '15) -- previously overlooked in the line of work on swap regret minimization -- combined with geometric preconditioning via the John ellipsoid. Our algorithm simultaneously minimizes profile swap regret, which was recently shown to guarantee non-manipulability. Moreover, we establish a matching information-theoretic lower bound: any learner must incur in expectation $Ω(d \sqrt{T})$ linear swap regret for large enough $T$, even when the set is centrally symmetric. This also shows that the classic algorithm of Gordon, Greenwald, and Marks (ICML '08) is existentially optimal for minimizing linear swap regret, although it is computationally inefficient. Finally, we extend our approach to minimize regret with respect to the set of swap deviations with polynomial dimension, unifying and strengthening recent results in equilibrium computation and online learning.

Abstract: We propose a novel deterministic purification method to improve adversarial robustness by mapping a potentially adversarial sample toward a nearby sample that lies close to a mode of the data distribution, where classifiers are more reliable. We design the method to be deterministic to ensure reliable test accuracy and to prevent the degradation of effective robustness observed in stochastic purification approaches when the adversary has full knowledge of the system and its randomness. We employ a score model trained by minimizing the expected reconstruction error of noise-corrupted data, thereby learning the structural characteristics of the input data distribution. Given a potentially adversarial input, the method searches within its local neighborhood for a purified sample that minimizes the expected reconstruction error under noise corruption and then feeds this purified sample to the classifier. During purification, sharpness-aware minimization is used to guide the purified samples toward flat regions of the expected reconstruction error landscape, thereby enhancing robustness. We further show that, as the noise level decreases, minimizing the expected reconstruction error biases the purified sample toward local maximizers of the Gaussian-smoothed density; under additional local assumptions on the score model, we prove recovery of a local maximizer in the small-noise limit. Experimental results demonstrate significant gains in adversarial robustness over state-of-the-art methods under strong deterministic white-box attacks.

Abstract: We address the problem of training conversion prediction models in advertising domains under privacy constraints, where direct links between ad clicks and conversions are unavailable. Motivated by privacy-preserving browser APIs and the deprecation of third-party cookies, we study a setting where the learner observes a sequence of clicks and a sequence of conversions, but can only link a conversion to a set of candidate clicks (an attribution set) rather than a unique source. We formalize this as learning from attribution sets generated by an oblivious adversary equipped with a prior distribution over the candidates. Despite the lack of explicit labels, we construct an unbiased estimator of the population loss from these coarse signals via a novel approach. Leveraging this estimator, we show that Empirical Risk Minimization achieves generalization guarantees that scale with the informativeness of the prior and is also robust against estimation errors in the prior, despite complex dependencies among attribution sets. Simple empirical evaluations on standard datasets suggest our unbiased approach significantly outperforms common industry heuristics, particularly in regimes where attribution sets are large or overlapping.

Abstract: Exploiting sparsity during long-context inference is central to scaling large language models, as attention dominates the cost of autoregressive decoding. Sparse attention reduces this cost by restricting computation to a subset of tokens, but its effectiveness depends critically on efficient scoring and selection of relevant tokens at inference time. We revisit Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) as a sparsification primitive and introduce SOCKET, a SOft Collision Kernel EsTimator that replaces hard bucket matches with probabilistic, similarity-aware aggregation. Our key insight is that hard LSH produces discrete collision signals and is therefore poorly suited for ranking. In contrast, soft LSH aggregates graded collision evidence across hash tables, preserving the stability of relative ordering among the true top-$k$ tokens. This transformation elevates LSH from a candidate-generation heuristic to a principled and mathematically grounded scoring kernel for sparse attention. Leveraging this property, SOCKET enables efficient token selection without ad-hoc voting mechanism, and matches or surpasses established sparse attention baselines across multiple long-context benchmarks using diverse set of models. With a custom CUDA kernel for scoring keys and a Flash Decode Triton backend for sparse attention, SOCKET achieves up to 1.5$\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention, making it an effective tool for long-context inference. Code is open-sourced at https://github.com/amarka8/SOCKET.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying uncertainty in predictions and projections arising from irreducible internal climate variability is critical for informed decision making. Such uncertainty is typically assessed using ensembles produced with physics based climate models. However, computational constraints impose a trade off between generating the large ensembles required for robust uncertainty estimation and increasing model resolution to better capture fine scale dynamics. Generative machine learning offers a promising pathway to alleviate these constraints. We develop a conditional Variational Autoencoder (cVAE) trained on a limited sample of climate simulations to generate arbitrary large ensembles. The approach is applied to output from monthly CMIP6 historical and future scenario experiments produced with the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis' (CCCma's) Earth system model CanESM5. We show that the cVAE model learns the underlying distribution of the data and generates physically consistent samples that reproduce realistic low and high moment statistics, including extremes. Compared with more sophisticated generative architectures, cVAEs offer a mathematically transparent, interpretable, and computationally efficient framework. Their simplicity lead to some limitations, such as overly smooth outputs, spectral bias, and underdispersion, that we discuss along with strategies to mitigate them. Specifically, we show that incorporating output noise improves the representation of climate relevant multiscale variability, and we propose a simple method to achieve this. Finally, we show that cVAE-enhanced ensembles capture realistic global teleconnection patterns, even under climate conditions absent from the training data.

Abstract: We present the Condensate Theorem: attention sparsity is a learned topological property, not an architectural constraint. Through empirical analysis of trained language models, we find that attention mass concentrates on a distinct topological manifold -- and this manifold can be identified dynamically without checking every position. We prove a general result: for any query, projecting attention onto the Condensate Manifold (Anchor + Window + Dynamic Top-k) achieves 100% output equivalence with full $O(n^2)$ attention. This is not an approximation -- it is lossless parity. We validate this across GPT-2, Pythia, Qwen2, TinyLlama, and Mistral, demonstrating bit-exact token matching on 1,500+ generated tokens. By mapping this topology to hardware, our Topological Attention kernel achieves a 159x measured speedup at 131K tokens (3.94ms vs 628ms) and a projected >1,200x speedup at 1M tokens, reducing inference costs by >99.9% compared to Flash Attention. We conclude that the quadratic bottleneck is an artifact of naive implementation, not intelligence.

Abstract: Epidemiological forecasting from surveillance data is a hard problem and hybridizing mechanistic compartmental models with neural models is a natural direction. The mechanistic structure helps keep trajectories epidemiologically plausible, while neural components can capture non-stationary, data-adaptive effects. In practice, however, many seemingly straightforward couplings fail under partial observability and continually shifting transmission dynamics driven by behavior, waning immunity, seasonality, and interventions. We catalog these failure modes and show that robust performance requires making non-stationarity explicit: we extract multi-scale structure from the observed infection series and use it as an interpretable control signal for a controlled neural ODE coupled to an epidemiological model. Concretely, we decompose infections into trend, seasonal, and residual components and use these signals to drive continuous-time latent dynamics while jointly forecasting and inferring time-varying transmission, recovery, and immunity-loss rates. Across seasonal and non-seasonal settings, including early outbreaks and multi-wave regimes, our approach reduces long-horizon RMSE by 15-35%, improves peak timing error by 1-3 weeks, and lowers peak magnitude bias by up to 30% relative to strong time-series, neural ODE, and hybrid baselines, without relying on auxiliary covariates.

While Domain Randomization (DR) and meta-RL have been proposed to address this issue, they typically rely on extensive pretraining, privileged information, or high computational cost, limiting their applicability to real-time and edge systems. In this paper, we propose a lightweight online adaptation framework for RL based on Reservoir Computing. Specifically, we integrate an Echo State Networks (ESNs) as an adaptation module that encodes recent observation histories into a latent context representation, and update its readout weights online using Recursive Least Squares (RLS). This design enables rapid adaptation without backpropagation, pretraining, or access to privileged information. We evaluate the proposed method on CartPole and HalfCheetah tasks with severe and abrupt environment changes, including periodic external disturbances and extreme friction variations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms DR and representative adaptive baselines under out-of-distribution dynamics, achieving stable adaptation within a few control steps. Notably, the method successfully handles intra-episode environment changes without resetting the policy. Due to its computational efficiency and stability, the proposed framework provides a practical solution for online adaptation in non-stationary environments and is well suited for real-world robotic control and edge deployment.

Abstract: Deploying trustworthy AI in open-world environments faces a dual challenge: the necessity for robust Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection to ensure system safety, and the demand for flexible machine unlearning to satisfy privacy compliance and model rectification. However, this objective encounters a fundamental geometric contradiction: current OOD detectors rely on a static and compact data manifold, whereas traditional classification-oriented unlearning methods disrupt this delicate structure, leading to a catastrophic loss of the model's capability to discriminate anomalies while erasing target classes. To resolve this dilemma, we first define the problem of boundary-preserving class unlearning and propose a pivotal conceptual shift: in the context of OOD detection, effective unlearning is mathematically equivalent to transforming the target class into OOD samples. Based on this, we propose the TFER (Total Free Energy Repulsion) framework. Inspired by the free energy principle, TFER constructs a novel Push-Pull game mechanism: it anchors retained classes within a low-energy ID manifold through a pull mechanism, while actively expelling forgotten classes to high-energy OOD regions using a free energy repulsion force. This approach is implemented via parameter-efficient fine-tuning, circumventing the prohibitive cost of full retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TFER achieves precise unlearning while maximally preserving the model's discriminative performance on remaining classes and external OOD data. More importantly, our study reveals that the unique Push-Pull equilibrium of TFER endows the model with inherent structural stability, allowing it to effectively resist catastrophic forgetting without complex additional constraints, thereby demonstrating exceptional potential in continual unlearning tasks.

Abstract: Learning interpretable representations with variational autoencoders (VAEs) is a major goal of representation learning. The main challenge lies in obtaining disentangled representations, where each latent dimension corresponds to a distinct generative factor. This difficulty is fundamentally tied to the inability to perform nonlinear independent component analysis. Here, we introduce the framework of action-induced representations (AIRs) which models representations of physical systems given experiments (or actions) that can be performed on them. We show that, in this framework, we can provably disentangle degrees of freedom w.r.t. their action dependence. We further introduce a variational AIR architecture (VAIR) that can extract AIRs and therefore achieve provable disentanglement where standard VAEs fail. Beyond state representation, VAIR also captures the action dependence of the underlying generative factors, directly linking experiments to the degrees of freedom they influence.

Abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) requires the learner to predict the degree of correlation between each sample and each label. To achieve this, a crucial task during learning is to leverage the correlation among labels. Deep Forest (DF) is a deep learning framework based on tree ensembles, whose training phase does not rely on backpropagation. DF performs in-model feature transform using the prediction of each layer and achieves competitive performance on many tasks. However, its exploration in the field of LDL is still in its infancy. The few existing methods that apply DF to the field of LDL do not have effective ways to utilize the correlation among labels. Therefore, we propose a method named Enhanced and Reused Feature Deep Forest (ERDF). It mainly contains two mechanisms: feature enhancement exploiting label correlation and measure-aware feature reuse. The first one is to utilize the correlation among labels to enhance the original features, enabling the samples to acquire more comprehensive information for the task of LDL. The second one performs a reuse operation on the features of samples that perform worse than the previous layer on the validation set, in order to ensure the stability of the training process. This kind of Enhance-Reuse pattern not only enables samples to enrich their features but also validates the effectiveness of their new features and conducts a reuse process to prevent the noise from spreading further. Experiments show that our method outperforms other comparison algorithms on six evaluation metrics.

Abstract: LLMs can generate a wealth of data, ranging from simulated personas imitating human valuations and preferences, to demand forecasts based on world knowledge. But how well do such LLM-generated distributions support downstream decision-making? For example, when pricing a new product, a firm could prompt an LLM to simulate how much consumers are willing to pay based on a product description, but how useful is the resulting distribution for optimizing the price? We refer to this approach as LLM-SAA, in which an LLM is used to construct an estimated distribution and the decision is then optimized under that distribution. In this paper, we study metrics to evaluate the quality of these LLM-generated distributions, based on the decisions they induce. Taking three canonical decision-making problems (assortment optimization, pricing, and newsvendor) as examples, we find that LLM-generated distributions are practically useful, especially in low-data regimes. We also show that decision-agnostic metrics such as Wasserstein distance can be misleading when evaluating these distributions for decision-making.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for specialized domains often necessitates a trade-off between acquiring domain expertise and retaining general reasoning capabilities, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Existing remedies face a dichotomy: gradient surgery methods offer geometric safety but incur prohibitive computational costs via online projections, while efficient data selection approaches reduce overhead but remain blind to conflict-inducing gradient directions. In this paper, we propose Orthogonal Gradient Selection (OGS), a data-centric method that harmonizes domain performance, general capability retention, and training efficiency. OGS shifts the geometric insights of gradient projection from the optimizer to the data selection stage by treating data selection as a constrained decision-making process. By leveraging a lightweight Navigator model and reinforcement learning techniques, OGS dynamically identifies training samples whose gradients are orthogonal to a general-knowledge anchor. This approach ensures naturally safe updates for target models without modifying the optimizer or incurring runtime projection costs. Experiments across medical, legal, and financial domains demonstrate that OGS achieves excellent results, significantly improving domain performance and training efficiency while maintaining or even enhancing performance on general tasks such as GSM8K.

Abstract: Spectral gradient descent (SpecGD) orthogonalizes the matrix parameter updates and has inspired practical optimizers such as Muon. They often perform well in large language model (LLM) training, but their dynamics remain poorly understood. In the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) setting, where weight updates are parameterized as a product of two low-rank factors, we find a distinctive spectral phenomenon under Muon in LoRA fine-tuning of LLMs: singular values of the LoRA product show near-uniform growth across the spectrum, despite orthogonalization being performed on the two factors separately. Motivated by this observation, we analyze spectral gradient flow (SpecGF)-a continuous-time analogue of SpecGD-in a simplified LoRA-style matrix factorization setting and prove "equal-rate" dynamics: all singular values grow at equal rates up to small deviations. Consequently, smaller singular values attain their target values earlier than larger ones, sharply contrasting with the largest-first stepwise learning observed in standard gradient flow. Moreover, we prove that SpecGF in our setting converges to global minima from almost all initializations, provided the factor norms remain bounded; with $\ell_2$ regularization, we obtain global convergence. Lastly, we corroborate our theory with experiments in the same setting.

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data enables sharing and analysis of sensitive records, but its practical deployment requires balancing distributional fidelity, downstream utility, and privacy protection. We study a simple, model agnostic post processing framework that can be applied on top of any synthetic data generator to improve this trade off. First, a mode patching step repairs categories that are missing or severely underrepresented in the synthetic data, while largely preserving learned dependencies. Second, a k nearest neighbor filter replaces synthetic records that lie too close to real data points, enforcing a minimum distance between real and synthetic samples. We instantiate this framework for two neural generative models for tabular data, a feed forward generator and a variational autoencoder, and evaluate it on three public datasets covering credit card transactions, cardiovascular health, and census based income. We assess marginal and joint distributional similarity, the performance of models trained on synthetic data and evaluated on real data, and several empirical privacy indicators, including nearest neighbor distances and attribute inference attacks. With moderate thresholds between 0.2 and 0.35, the post processing reduces divergence between real and synthetic categorical distributions by up to 36 percent and improves a combined measure of pairwise dependence preservation by 10 to 14 percent, while keeping downstream predictive performance within about 1 percent of the unprocessed baseline. At the same time, distance based privacy indicators improve and the success rate of attribute inference attacks remains largely unchanged. These results provide practical guidance for selecting thresholds and applying post hoc repairs to improve the quality and empirical privacy of synthetic tabular data, while complementing approaches that provide formal differential privacy guarantees.

Abstract: We study distributed adversarial bandits, where $N$ agents cooperate to minimize the global average loss while observing only their own local losses. We show that the minimax regret for this problem is $\tildeΘ(\sqrt{(ρ^{-1/2}+K/N)T})$, where $T$ is the horizon, $K$ is the number of actions, and $ρ$ is the spectral gap of the communication matrix. Our algorithm, based on a novel black-box reduction to bandits with delayed feedback, requires agents to communicate only through gossip. It achieves an upper bound that significantly improves over the previous best bound $\tilde{O}(ρ^{-1/3}(KT)^{2/3})$ of Yi and Vojnovic (2023). We complement this result with a matching lower bound, showing that the problem's difficulty decomposes into a communication cost $ρ^{-1/4}\sqrt{T}$ and a bandit cost $\sqrt{KT/N}$. We further demonstrate the versatility of our approach by deriving first-order and best-of-both-worlds bounds in the distributed adversarial setting. Finally, we extend our framework to distributed linear bandits in $R^d$, obtaining a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{(ρ^{-1/2}+1/N)dT})$, achieved with only $O(d)$ communication cost per agent and per round via a volumetric spanner.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based emotion recognition plays a critical role in affective computing and emerging decision-support systems, yet remains challenging due to high-dimensional, noisy, and subject-dependent signals. This study investigates whether hybrid deep learning architectures that integrate convolutional, recurrent, and attention-based components can improve emotion classification performance and robustness in EEG data. We propose an enhanced hybrid model that combines convolutional feature extraction, bidirectional temporal modeling, and self-attention mechanisms with regularization strategies to mitigate overfitting. Experiments conducted on a publicly available EEG dataset spanning three emotional states (neutral, positive, and negative) demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art classification performance, significantly outperforming classical machine learning and neural baselines. Statistical tests confirm the robustness of these performance gains under cross-validation. Feature-level analyses further reveal that covariance-based EEG features contribute most strongly to emotion discrimination, highlighting the importance of inter-channel relationships in affective modeling. These findings suggest that carefully designed hybrid architectures can effectively balance predictive accuracy, robustness, and interpretability in EEG-based emotion recognition, with implications for applied affective computing and human-centered intelligent systems.

Abstract: Tokenization is a promising path to multi-modal models capable of jointly understanding protein sequences, structure, and function. Existing protein structure tokenizers create tokens by pooling information from local neighborhoods, an approach that limits their performance on generative and representation tasks. In this work, we present a method for global tokenization of protein structures in which successive tokens contribute increasing levels of detail to a global representation. This change resolves several issues with generative models based on local protein tokenization: it mitigates error accumulation, provides embeddings without sequence-reduction operations, and allows task-specific adaptation of a tokenized sequence's information content. We validate our method on reconstruction, generative, and representation tasks and demonstrate that it matches or outperforms existing models based on local protein structure tokenizers. We show how adaptive tokens enable inference criteria based on information content, which boosts designability. We validate representations generated from our tokenizer on CATH classification tasks and demonstrate that non-linear probing on our tokenized sequences outperforms equivalent probing on representations from other tokenizers. Finally, we demonstrate how our method supports zero-shot protein shrinking and affinity maturation.

Abstract: Open source software (OSS) projects rely on complex networks of contributors whose interactions drive innovation and sustainability. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of OSS contributor networks using advanced graph neural networks and temporal network analysis on data spanning 25 years from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ecosystem, encompassing sandbox, incubating, and graduated projects. Our analysis of thousands of contributors across hundreds of repositories reveals that OSS networks exhibit strong power-law distributions in influence, with the top 1\% of contributors controlling a substantial portion of network influence. Using GPU-accelerated PageRank, betweenness centrality, and custom LSTM models, we identify five distinct contributor roles: Core, Bridge, Connector, Regular, and Peripheral, each with unique network positions and structural importance. Statistical analysis reveals significant correlations between specific action types (commits, pull requests, issues) and contributor influence, with multiple regression models explaining substantial variance in influence metrics. Temporal analysis shows that network density, clustering coefficients, and modularity exhibit statistically significant temporal trends, with distinct regime changes coinciding with major project milestones. Structural integrity simulations show that Bridge contributors, despite representing a small fraction of the network, have a disproportionate impact on network cohesion when removed. Our findings provide empirical evidence for strategic contributor retention policies and offer actionable insights into community health metrics.

Abstract: Conceptual hydrologic models remain the cornerstone of rainfall-runoff modeling, yet their calibration is often slow and numerically fragile. Most gradient-based parameter estimation methods rely on finite-difference approximations or automatic differentiation frameworks (e.g., JAX, PyTorch and TensorFlow), which are computationally demanding and introduce truncation errors, solver instabilities, and substantial overhead. These limitations are particularly acute for the ODE systems of conceptual watershed models. Here we introduce a fully analytic and computationally efficient framework for differentiable hydrologic modeling based on exact parameter sensitivities. By augmenting the governing ODE system with sensitivity equations, we jointly evolve the model states and the Jacobian matrix with respect to all parameters. This Jacobian then provides fully analytic gradient vectors for any differentiable loss function. These include classical objective functions such as the sum of absolute and squared residuals, widely used hydrologic performance metrics such as the Nash-Sutcliffe and Kling-Gupta efficiencies, robust loss functions that down-weight extreme events, and hydrograph-based functionals such as flow-duration and recession curves. The analytic sensitivities eliminate the step-size dependence and noise inherent to numerical differentiation, while avoiding the instability of adjoint methods and the overhead of modern machine-learning autodiff toolchains. The resulting gradients are deterministic, physically interpretable, and straightforward to embed in gradient-based optimizers. Overall, this work enables rapid, stable, and transparent gradient-based calibration of conceptual hydrologic models, unlocking the full potential of differentiable modeling without reliance on external, opaque, or CPU-intensive automatic-differentiation libraries.

Abstract: For ethical and safe AI, machine unlearning rises as a critical topic aiming to protect sensitive, private, and copyrighted knowledge from misuse. To achieve this goal, it is common to conduct gradient ascent (GA) to reverse the training on undesired data. However, such a reversal is prone to catastrophic collapse, which leads to serious performance degradation in general tasks. As a solution, we propose model extrapolation as an alternative to GA, which reaches the counterpart direction in the hypothesis space from one model given another reference model. Therefore, we leverage the original model as the reference, further train it to memorize undesired data while keeping prediction consistency on the rest retained data, to obtain a memorization model. Counterfactual as it might sound, a forget model can be obtained via extrapolation from the memorization model to the reference model. Hence, we avoid directly acquiring the forget model using GA, but proceed with gradient descent for the memorization model, which successfully stabilizes the machine unlearning process. Our model extrapolation is simple and efficient to implement, and it can also effectively converge throughout training to achieve improved unlearning performance.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based scientific agents have accelerated scientific discovery, yet they often suffer from significant inefficiencies due to adherence to fixed initial priors. Existing approaches predominantly operate within a static hypothesis space, which restricts the discovery of novel phenomena, resulting in computational waste when baseline theories fail. To address this, we propose shifting the focus from searching hypotheses to evolving the underlying scientific principles. We present PiEvo, a principle-evolvable framework that treats scientific discovery as Bayesian optimization over an expanding principle space. By integrating Information-Directed Hypothesis Selection via Gaussian Process and an anomaly-driven augmentation mechanism, PiEvo enables agents to autonomously refine their theoretical worldview. Evaluation across four benchmarks demonstrates that PiEvo (1) achieves an average solution quality of up to 90.81%~93.15%, representing a 29.7%~31.1% improvement over the state-of-the-art, (2) attains an 83.3% speedup in convergence step via significantly reduced sample complexity by optimizing the compact principle space, and (3) maintains robust performance across diverse scientific domains and LLM backbones.

Abstract: Multi-modal learning combines various modalities to provide a comprehensive understanding of real-world problems. A common strategy is to directly bind different modalities together in a specific joint embedding space. However, the capability of existing methods is restricted within the modalities presented in the given dataset, thus they are biased when generalizing to unpresented modalities in downstream tasks. As a result, due to such inflexibility, the viability of previous methods is seriously hindered by the cost of acquiring multi-modal datasets. In this paper, we introduce BrokenBind, which focuses on binding modalities that are presented from different datasets. To achieve this, BrokenBind simultaneously leverages multiple datasets containing the modalities of interest and one shared modality. Though the two datasets do not correspond to each other due to distribution mismatch, we can capture their relationship to generate pseudo embeddings to fill in the missing modalities of interest, enabling flexible and generalized multi-modal learning. Under our framework, any two modalities can be bound together, free from the dataset limitation, to achieve universal modality exploration. Further, to reveal the capability of our method, we study intensified scenarios where more than two datasets are needed for modality binding and show the effectiveness of BrokenBind in low-data regimes. Through extensive evaluation, we carefully justify the superiority of BrokenBind compared to well-known multi-modal baseline methods.

Abstract: Training stability remains a critical bottleneck for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), often manifesting as a trade-off between reasoning plasticity and general capability retention. We identify a root cause as the geometric conflict between plasticity and stability gradients, which leads to destructive interference. Crucially, we argue that deterministic projection methods are suboptimal for GRPO as they overlook the intrinsic stochasticity of group-based gradient estimates. To address this, we propose Probabilistic Conflict Resolution (PCR), a Bayesian framework that models gradients as random variables. PCR dynamically arbitrates conflicts via an uncertainty-aware ``soft projection'' mechanism, optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PCR significantly smooths the training trajectory and achieves superior performance in various reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Non-stationarity of an underlying data generating process that leads to distributional changes over time is a key characteristic of Data Streams. This phenomenon, commonly referred to as Concept Drift, has been intensively studied, and Concept Drift Detectors have been established as a class of methods for detecting such changes (drifts). For the most part, Drift Detectors compare regions (windows) of the data stream and detect drift if those windows are sufficiently dissimilar.
  In this work, we introduce the Window Dilemma, an observation that perceived drift is a product of windowing and not necessarily the underlying data generating process. Additionally, we highlight that drift detection is ill-posed, primarily because verification of drift events are implausible in practice. We demonstrate these contributions first by an illustrative example, followed by empirical comparisons of drift detectors against a variety of alternative adaptation strategies. Our main finding is that traditional batch learning techniques often perform better than their drift-aware counterparts further bringing into question the purpose of detectors in Stream Classification.

Abstract: Online bilevel optimization (OBO) has emerged as a powerful framework for many machine learning problems. Prior works have developed several algorithms that minimize the standard bilevel local regret or the window-averaged bilevel local regret of the OBO problem, but the optimality of existing regret bounds remains unclear. In this work, we establish optimal regret bounds for both settings. For standard bilevel local regret, we propose an algorithm that achieves the optimal regret $Ω(1+V_T)$ with at most $O(T\log T)$ total inner-level gradient evaluations. We further develop a fully single-loop algorithm whose regret bound includes an additional gradient-variation terms. For the window-averaged bilevel local regret, we design an algorithm that captures sublinear environmental variation through a window-based analysis and achieves the optimal regret $Ω(T/W^2)$. Experiments validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex tasks with advances in reasoning capabilities. However, existing reward mechanisms remain tightly coupled to final correctness and pay little attention to the underlying reasoning process: trajectories with sound reasoning but wrong answers receive low credit, while lucky guesses with flawed logic may be highly rewarded, affecting reasoning generalization. From a causal perspective, we interpret multi-candidate reasoning for a fixed question as a family of counterfactual experiments with theoretical supports. Building on this, we propose Group Causal Counterfactual Policy Optimization to explicitly train LLMs to learn generalizable reasoning patterns. It proposes an episodic causal counterfactual reward that jointly captures (i) robustness, encouraging the answer distribution induced by a reasoning step to remain stable under counterfactual perturbations; and (ii) effectiveness, enforcing sufficient variability so that the learned reasoning strategy can transfer across questions. We then construct token-level advantages from this reward and optimize the policy, encouraging LLMs to favor reasoning patterns that are process-valid and counterfactually robust. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate its advantages.

Abstract: Inference-time reasoning scaling has significantly advanced the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex problem-solving. A prevalent approach involves external search guided by Process Reward Models (PRMs). However, a fundamental limitation of this framework is the epistemic uncertainty of PRMs when evaluating reasoning paths that deviate from their training distribution. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of this challenge. We first provide empirical evidence that PRMs exhibit high uncertainty and unreliable scoring on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. We then establish a theoretical framework proving that while standard search incurs linear regret accumulation, an uncertainty-aware strategy can achieve sublinear regret. Motivated by these findings, we propose Uncertainty-Aware Tree Search (UATS), a unified method that estimates uncertainty via Monte Carlo Dropout and dynamically allocates compute budget using a reinforcement learning-based controller. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the impact of OOD errors.

Abstract: Scaling inference methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo to high-dimensional models remains a central challenge in Bayesian deep learning. A promising recent proposal, microcanonical Langevin Monte Carlo, has shown state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of problems. However, its reliance on full-dataset gradients makes it prohibitively expensive for large-scale problems. This paper addresses a fundamental question: Can microcanonical dynamics effectively leverage mini-batch gradient noise? We provide the first systematic study of this problem, establishing a novel continuous-time theoretical analysis of stochastic-gradient microcanonical dynamics. We reveal two critical failure modes: a theoretically derived bias due to anisotropic gradient noise and numerical instabilities in complex high-dimensional posteriors. To tackle these issues, we propose a principled gradient noise preconditioning scheme shown to significantly reduce this bias and develop a novel, energy-variance-based adaptive tuner that automates step size selection and dynamically informs numerical guardrails. The resulting algorithm is a robust and scalable microcanonical Monte Carlo sampler that achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging high-dimensional inference tasks like Bayesian neural networks. Combined with recent ensemble techniques, our work unlocks a new class of stochastic microcanonical Langevin ensemble (SMILE) samplers for large-scale Bayesian inference.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) show strong promise for complex reasoning, planning, and tool-augmented tasks, but designing effective MAS architectures remains labor-intensive, brittle, and hard to generalize. Existing automatic MAS generation methods either rely on code generation, which often leads to executability and robustness failures, or impose rigid architectural templates that limit expressiveness and adaptability. We propose Evolutionary Generation of Multi-Agent Systems (EvoMAS), which formulates MAS generation as structured configuration generation. EvoMAS performs evolutionary generation in configuration space. Specifically, EvoMAS selects initial configurations from a pool, applies feedback-conditioned mutation and crossover guided by execution traces, and iteratively refines both the candidate pool and an experience memory. We evaluate EvoMAS on diverse benchmarks, including BBEH, SWE-Bench, and WorkBench, covering reasoning, software engineering, and tool-use tasks. EvoMAS consistently improves task performance over both human-designed MAS and prior automatic MAS generation methods, while producing generated systems with higher executability and runtime robustness. EvoMAS outperforms the agent evolution method EvoAgent by +10.5 points on BBEH reasoning and +7.1 points on WorkBench. With Claude-4.5-Sonnet, EvoMAS also reaches 79.1% on SWE-Bench-Verified, matching the top of the leaderboard.

Abstract: Deep knowledge tracing models have achieved significant breakthroughs in modeling student learning trajectories. However, these architectures require substantial training time and are prone to overfitting on datasets with short sequences. In this paper, we explore a new paradigm for knowledge tracing by leveraging tabular foundation models (TFMs). Unlike traditional methods that require offline training on a fixed training set, our approach performs real-time ''live'' knowledge tracing in an online way. The core of our method lies in a two-way attention mechanism: while attention knowledge tracing models only attend across earlier time steps, TFMs simultaneously attend across both time steps and interactions of other students in the training set. They align testing sequences with relevant training sequences at inference time, therefore skipping the training step entirely. We demonstrate, using several datasets of increasing size, that our method achieves competitive predictive performance with up to 273x speedups, in a setting where more student interactions are observed over time.

Abstract: Generalizing from limited data is particularly critical for models in domains such as material science, where task-relevant features in experimental datasets are often heavily confounded by measurement noise and experimental artifacts. Standard regularization techniques fail to precisely separate meaningful features from noise, while existing adversarial adaptation methods are limited by their reliance on explicit separation labels. To address this challenge, we propose the Adversarial Information Separation Framework (AdverISF), which isolates task-relevant features from noise without requiring explicit supervision. AdverISF introduces a self-supervised adversarial mechanism to enforce statistical independence between task-relevant features and noise representations. It further employs a multi-layer separation architecture that progressively recycles noise information across feature hierarchies to recover features inadvertently discarded as noise, thereby enabling finer-grained feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AdverISF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in data-scarce scenarios. In addition, evaluations on real-world material design tasks show that it achieves superior generalization performance.

Abstract: Zero-shot generalization in contextual reinforcement learning remains a core challenge, particularly when the context is latent and must be inferred from data. A canonical failure mode is actuator inversion, where identical actions produce opposite physical effects under a latent binary context. We propose DMA*-SH, a framework where a single hypernetwork, trained solely via dynamics prediction, generates a small set of adapter weights shared across the dynamics model, policy, and action-value function. This shared modulation imparts an inductive bias matched to actuator inversion, while input/output normalization and random input masking stabilize context inference, promoting directionally concentrated representations. We provide theoretical support via an expressivity separation result for hypernetwork modulation, and a variance decomposition with policy-gradient variance bounds that formalize how within-mode compression improves learning under actuator inversion. For evaluation, we introduce the Actuator Inversion Benchmark (AIB), a suite of environments designed to isolate discontinuous context-to-dynamics interactions. On AIB's held-out actuator-inversion tasks, DMA*-SH achieves zero-shot generalization, outperforming domain randomization by 111.8% and surpassing a standard context-aware baseline by 16.1%.

Abstract: Model merging constructs versatile models by integrating task-specific models without requiring labeled data or expensive joint retraining. Although recent methods improve adaptability to heterogeneous tasks by generating customized merged models for each instance, they face two critical limitations. First, the instance-specific merged models lack reusability, restricting the exploitation of high-quality merging configurations and efficient batch inference. Second, these methods treat each task-specific model as a monolithic whole, overlooking the diverse mergeability of homologous components such as attention and multilayer perceptron layers, and the differing merging sensitivities across components. To address these limitations, we propose MERGE (\underline{M}odular \underline{E}xpert \underline{R}ecombination for fine-\underline{G}rained m\underline{E}rging), a method that enables component-wise model merging and input-aware, on-demand module recombination at inference. MERGE formulates component-wise merging as a bi-objective optimization problem that balances cross-task performance and storage efficiency, and develops a surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm to efficiently identify Pareto-optimal merging configurations. These high-quality configurations underpin a reusable modular expert library, from which a lightweight routing network dynamically activates and recombines modular experts to assemble input-specific models and enable efficient inference under storage constraints. Extensive experiments across various model scales, task types, and fine-tuning strategies demonstrate that MERGE consistently outperforms strong baselines and generalizes effectively.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have established themselves as the leading models for learning on graph-structured data, generally categorized into spatial and spectral approaches. Central to these architectures is the Graph Shift Operator (GSO), a matrix representation of the graph structure used to filter node signals. However, selecting the optimal GSO, whether fixed or learnable, remains largely empirical. In this paper, we introduce a novel alignment gain metric that quantifies the geometric distortion between the input signal and label subspaces. Crucially, our theoretical analysis connects this alignment directly to generalization bounds via a spectral proxy for the Lipschitz constant. This yields a principled, computation-efficient criterion to rank and select the optimal GSO for any prediction task prior to training, eliminating the need for extensive search.

Abstract: Large language models can resist task-misaligned activation steering during inference, sometimes recovering mid-generation to produce improved responses even when steering remains active. We term this Endogenous Steering Resistance (ESR). Using sparse autoencoder (SAE) latents to steer model activations, we find that Llama-3.3-70B shows substantial ESR, while smaller models from the Llama-3 and Gemma-2 families exhibit the phenomenon less frequently. We identify 26 SAE latents that activate differentially during off-topic content and are causally linked to ESR in Llama-3.3-70B. Zero-ablating these latents reduces the multi-attempt rate by 25%, providing causal evidence for dedicated internal consistency-checking circuits. We demonstrate that ESR can be deliberately enhanced through both prompting and training: meta-prompts instructing the model to self-monitor increase the multi-attempt rate by 4x for Llama-3.3-70B, and fine-tuning on self-correction examples successfully induces ESR-like behavior in smaller models. These findings have dual implications: ESR could protect against adversarial manipulation but might also interfere with beneficial safety interventions that rely on activation steering. Understanding and controlling these resistance mechanisms is important for developing transparent and controllable AI systems.

Abstract: Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI is a non-invasive imaging modality for detecting metabolites. It offers higher resolution and sensitivity compared to conventional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). However, quantification of CEST data is challenging because the measured signal results from a complex interplay of many physiological variables. Here, we introduce a transformer-based neural network to fit parameters such as metabolite concentrations, exchange and relaxation rates of a physical model derived from Bloch-McConnell equations to in-vitro CEST spectra. We show that our self-supervised trained neural network clearly outperforms the solution of classical gradient-based solver.

Abstract: Existing approaches for analyzing neural network activations, such as PCA and sparse autoencoders, rely on strong structural assumptions. Generative models offer an alternative: they can uncover structure without such assumptions and act as priors that improve intervention fidelity. We explore this direction by training diffusion models on one billion residual stream activations, creating "meta-models" that learn the distribution of a network's internal states. We find that diffusion loss decreases smoothly with compute and reliably predicts downstream utility. In particular, applying the meta-model's learned prior to steering interventions improves fluency, with larger gains as loss decreases. Moreover, the meta-model's neurons increasingly isolate concepts into individual units, with sparse probing scores that scale as loss decreases. These results suggest generative meta-models offer a scalable path toward interpretability without restrictive structural assumptions. Project page: https://generative-latent-prior.github.io.

Abstract: Complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) are rising in popularity for all kinds of applications. To safely use CVNNs in practice, analyzing their robustness against outliers is crucial. One well known technique to understand the behavior of deep neural networks is to investigate their behavior under adversarial attacks, which can be seen as worst case minimal perturbations. We design Phase Attacks, a kind of attack specifically targeting the phase information of complex-valued inputs. Additionally, we derive complex-valued versions of commonly used adversarial attacks. We show that in some scenarios CVNNs are more robust than RVNNs and that both are very susceptible to phase changes with the Phase Attacks decreasing the model performance more, than equally strong regular attacks, which can attack both phase and magnitude.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks against deep neural networks are commonly constructed under $\ell_p$ norm constraints, most often using $p=1$, $p=2$ or $p=\infty$, and potentially regularized for specific demands such as sparsity or smoothness. These choices are typically made without a systematic investigation of how the norm parameter \( p \) influences the structural and perceptual properties of adversarial perturbations. In this work, we study how the choice of \( p \) affects sparsity and smoothness of adversarial attacks generated under \( \ell_p \) norm constraints for values of $p \in [1,2]$. To enable a quantitative analysis, we adopt two established sparsity measures from the literature and introduce three smoothness measures. In particular, we propose a general framework for deriving smoothness measures based on smoothing operations and additionally introduce a smoothness measure based on first-order Taylor approximations. Using these measures, we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation across multiple real-world image datasets and a diverse set of model architectures, including both convolutional and transformer-based networks. We show that the choice of $\ell_1$ or $\ell_2$ is suboptimal in most cases and the optimal $p$ value is dependent on the specific task. In our experiments, using $\ell_p$ norms with $p\in [1.3, 1.5]$ yields the best trade-off between sparse and smooth attacks. These findings highlight the importance of principled norm selection when designing and evaluating adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Weight initialization plays a crucial role in the optimization behavior and convergence efficiency of neural networks. Most existing initialization methods, such as Xavier and Kaiming initializations, rely on random sampling and do not exploit information from the optimization process itself. We propose a simple, yet effective, initialization strategy based on self-supervised pre-training using random noise as the target. Instead of directly training the network from random weights, we first pre-train it to fit random noise, which leads to a structured and non-random parameter configuration. We show that this noise-driven pre-training significantly improves convergence speed in subsequent tasks, without requiring additional data or changes to the network architecture. The proposed method is particularly effective for implicit neural representations (INRs) and Deep Image Prior (DIP)-style networks, which are known to exhibit a strong low-frequency bias during optimization. After noise-based pre-training, the network is able to capture high-frequency components much earlier in training, leading to faster and more stable convergence. Although random noise contains no semantic information, it serves as an effective self-supervised signal (considering its white spectrum nature) for shaping the initialization of neural networks. Overall, this work demonstrates that noise-based pre-training offers a lightweight and general alternative to traditional random initialization, enabling more efficient optimization of deep neural networks.

Abstract: While generative modeling on time series facilitates more capable and flexible probabilistic forecasting, existing generative time series models do not address the multi-dimensional properties of time series data well. The prevalent architecture of Diffusion Transformers (DiT), which relies on simplistic conditioning controls and a single-stream Transformer backbone, tends to underutilize cross-variate dependencies in covariate-aware forecasting. Inspired by Multimodal Diffusion Transformers that integrate textual guidance into video generation, we propose Diffusion Transformers for Time Series (DiTS), a general-purpose architecture that frames endogenous and exogenous variates as distinct modalities. To better capture both inter-variate and intra-variate dependencies, we design a dual-stream Transformer block tailored for time-series data, comprising a Time Attention module for autoregressive modeling along the temporal dimension and a Variate Attention module for cross-variate modeling. Unlike the common approach for images, which flattens 2D token grids into 1D sequences, our design leverages the low-rank property inherent in multivariate dependencies, thereby reducing computational costs. Experiments show that DiTS achieves state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks, regardless of the presence of future exogenous variate observations, demonstrating unique generative forecasting strengths over traditional deterministic deep forecasting models.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (ORL) has shown potential for improving decision-making in healthcare. However, contemporary research typically aggregates patient data into fixed time intervals, simplifying their mapping to standard ORL frameworks. The impact of these temporal manipulations on model safety and efficacy remains poorly understood. In this work, using both a gridworld navigation task and the UVA/Padova clinical diabetes simulator, we demonstrate that temporal resampling significantly degrades the performance of offline reinforcement learning algorithms during live deployment. We propose three mechanisms that drive this failure: (i) the generation of counterfactual trajectories, (ii) the distortion of temporal expectations, and (iii) the compounding of generalisation errors. Crucially, we find that standard off-policy evaluation metrics can fail to detect these drops in performance. Our findings reveal a fundamental risk in current healthcare ORL pipelines and emphasise the need for methods that explicitly handle the irregular timing of clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Background: High-level system testing of applications that use data from e-Government services as input requires test data that is real-life-like but where the privacy of personal information is guaranteed. Applications with such strong requirement include information exchange between countries, medicine, banking, etc. This review aims to synthesize the current state-of-the-practice in this domain.
  Objectives: The objective of this Systematic Review is to identify existing approaches for creating and evolving synthetic test data without using real-life raw data.
  Methods: We followed well-known methodologies for conducting systematic literature reviews, including the ones from Kitchenham as well as guidelines for analysing the limitations of our review and its threats to validity.
  Results: A variety of methods and tools exist for creating privacy-preserving test data. Our search found 1,013 publications in IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and SCOPUS. We extracted data from 75 of those publications and identified 37 approaches that answer our research question partly. A common prerequisite for using these methods and tools is direct access to real-life data for data anonymization or synthetic test data generation. Nine existing synthetic test data generation approaches were identified that were closest to answering our research question. Nevertheless, further work would be needed to add the ability to evolve synthetic test data to the existing approaches.
  Conclusions: None of the publications really covered our requirements completely, only partially. Synthetic test data evolution is a field that has not received much attention from researchers but needs to be explored in Digital Government Solutions, especially since new legal regulations are being placed in force in many countries.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of outcomes is crucial for clinical decision-making and personalized patient care. Supervised machine learning algorithms, which are commonly used for outcome prediction in the medical domain, optimize for predictive accuracy, which can result in models latching onto spurious correlations instead of robust predictors. Causal structure learning methods on the other hand have the potential to provide robust predictors for the target, but can be too conservative because of algorithmic and data assumptions, resulting in loss of diagnostic precision. Therefore, we propose a novel model-agnostic regularization strategy, Adaptive-CaRe, for generalized outcome prediction in the medical domain. Adaptive-CaRe strikes a balance between both predictive value and causal robustness by incorporating a penalty that is proportional to the difference between the estimated statistical contribution and estimated causal contribution of the input features for model predictions. Our experiments on synthetic data establish the efficacy of the proposed Adaptive-CaRe regularizer in finding robust predictors for the target while maintaining competitive predictive accuracy. With experiments on a standard causal benchmark, we provide a blueprint for navigating the trade-off between predictive accuracy and causal robustness by tweaking the regularization strength, $λ$. Validation using real-world dataset confirms that the results translate to practical, real-domain settings. Therefore, Adaptive-CaRe provides a simple yet effective solution to the long-standing trade-off between predictive accuracy and causal robustness in the medical domain. Future work would involve studying alternate causal structure learning frameworks and complex classification models to provide deeper insights at a larger scale.

Abstract: Standard trust-region methods constrain policy updates via Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. However, KL controls only an average divergence and does not directly prevent rare, large likelihood-ratio excursions that destabilize training--precisely the failure mode that motivates heuristics such as PPO's clipping. We propose overlap geometry as an alternative trust region, constraining distributional overlap via the Bhattacharyya coefficient (closely related to the Hellinger/Renyi-1/2 geometry). This objective penalizes separation in the ratio tails, yielding tighter control over likelihood-ratio excursions without relying on total variation bounds that can be loose in tail regimes. We derive Bhattacharyya-TRPO (BTRPO) and Bhattacharyya-PPO (BPPO), enforcing overlap constraints via square-root ratio updates: BPPO clips the square-root ratio q = sqrt(r), and BTRPO applies a quadratic Hellinger/Bhattacharyya penalty. Empirically, overlap-based updates improve robustness and aggregate performance as measured by RLiable under matched training budgets, suggesting overlap constraints as a practical, principled alternative to KL for stable policy optimization.

Abstract: Pruning at Initialisation methods discover sparse, trainable subnetworks before training, but their theoretical mechanisms remain elusive. Existing analyses are often limited to finite-width statistics, lacking a rigorous characterisation of the global sparsity patterns that emerge as networks grow large. In this work, we connect discrete pruning heuristics to graph limit theory via graphons, establishing the graphon limit of PaI masks. We introduce a Factorised Saliency Model that encompasses popular pruning criteria and prove that, under regularity conditions, the discrete masks generated by these algorithms converge to deterministic bipartite graphons. This limit framework establishes a novel topological taxonomy for sparse networks: while unstructured methods (e.g., Random, Magnitude) converge to homogeneous graphons representing uniform connectivity, data-driven methods (e.g., SNIP, GraSP) converge to heterogeneous graphons that encode implicit feature selection. Leveraging this continuous characterisation, we derive two fundamental theoretical results: (i) a Universal Approximation Theorem for sparse networks that depends only on the intrinsic dimension of active coordinate subspaces; and (ii) a Graphon-NTK generalisation bound demonstrating how the limit graphon modulates the kernel geometry to align with informative features. Our results transform the study of sparse neural networks from combinatorial graph problems into a rigorous framework of continuous operators, offering a new mechanism for analysing expressivity and generalisation in sparse neural networks.

Abstract: Autoregressive generative PDE solvers can be accurate one step ahead yet drift over long rollouts, especially in coarse-to-fine regimes where each step must regenerate unresolved fine scales. This is the regime of diffusion and flow-matching generators: although their internal dynamics are Markovian, rollout stability is governed by per-step \emph{conditional law} errors. Using the Mori--Zwanzig projection formalism, we show that eliminating unresolved variables yields an exact resolved evolution with a Markov term, a memory term, and an orthogonal forcing, exposing a structural limitation of memoryless closures. Motivated by this, we introduce memory-conditioned diffusion/flow-matching with a compact online state injected into denoising via latent features. Via disintegration, memory induces a structured conditional tail prior for unresolved scales and reduces the transport needed to populate missing frequencies. We prove Wasserstein stability of the resulting conditional kernel. We then derive discrete Grönwall rollout bounds that separate memory approximation from conditional generation error. Experiments on compressible flows with shocks and multiscale mixing show improved accuracy and markedly more stable long-horizon rollouts, with better fine-scale spectral and statistical fidelity.

Abstract: Weight-only quantization has become a standard approach for efficiently serving large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods fail to efficiently compress models to binary (1-bit) levels, as they either require large amounts of data and compute or incur additional storage. In this work, we propose NanoQuant, the first post-training quantization (PTQ) method to compress LLMs to both binary and sub-1-bit levels. NanoQuant formulates quantization as a low-rank binary factorization problem, and compresses full-precision weights to low-rank binary matrices and scales. Specifically, it utilizes an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method to precisely initialize latent binary matrices and scales, and then tune the initialized parameters through a block and model reconstruction process. Consequently, NanoQuant establishes a new Pareto frontier in low-memory post-training quantization, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy even at sub-1-bit compression rates. NanoQuant makes large-scale deployment feasible on consumer hardware. For example, it compresses Llama2-70B by 25.8$\times$ in just 13 hours on a single H100, enabling a 70B model to operate on a consumer 8 GB GPU.

Abstract: Incorporating group symmetries via equivariance into neural networks has emerged as a robust approach for overcoming the efficiency and data demands of modern deep learning. While most existing approaches, such as group convolutions and averaging-based methods, focus on compact, finite, or low-dimensional groups with linear actions, this work explores how equivariance can be extended to infinite-dimensional groups. We propose a strategy designed to induce diffeomorphism equivariance in pre-trained neural networks via energy-based canonicalisation. Formulating equivariance as an optimisation problem allows us to access the rich toolbox of already established differentiable image registration methods. Empirical results on segmentation and classification tasks confirm that our approach achieves approximate equivariance and generalises to unseen transformations without relying on extensive data augmentation or retraining.

Abstract: We investigate grokking in transformers through the lens of inductive bias: dispositions arising from architecture or optimization that let the network prefer one solution over another. We first show that architectural choices such as the position of Layer Normalization (LN) strongly modulates grokking speed. This modulation is explained by isolating how LN on specific pathways shapes shortcut-learning and attention entropy. Subsequently, we study how different optimization settings modulate grokking, inducing distinct interpretations of previously proposed controls such as readout scale. Particularly, we find that using readout scale as a control for lazy training can be confounded by learning rate and weight decay in our setting. Accordingly, we show that features evolve continuously throughout training, suggesting grokking in transformers can be more nuanced than a lazy-to-rich transition of the learning regime. Finally, we show how generalization predictably emerges with feature compressibility in grokking, across different modulators of inductive bias. Our code is released at https://tinyurl.com/y52u3cad.

Abstract: Generative models for de novo protein backbone design have achieved remarkable success in creating novel protein structures. However, these diffusion-based approaches remain computationally intensive and slower than desired for large-scale structural exploration. While recent efforts like Proteina have introduced flow-matching to improve sampling efficiency, the potential of tokenization for structural compression and acceleration remains largely unexplored in the protein domain. In this work, we present SaDiT, a novel framework that accelerates protein backbone generation by integrating SaProt Tokenization with a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. SaDiT leverages a discrete latent space to represent protein geometry, significantly reducing the complexity of the generation process while maintaining theoretical SE(3) equivalence. To further enhance efficiency, we introduce an IPA Token Cache mechanism that optimizes the Invariant Point Attention (IPA) layers by reusing computed token states during iterative sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that SaDiT outperforms state-of-the-art models, including RFDiffusion and Proteina, in both computational speed and structural viability. We evaluate our model across unconditional backbone generation and fold-class conditional generation tasks, where SaDiT shows superior ability to capture complex topological features with high designability.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is commonly based on group sampling to estimate advantages and stabilize policy updates. In practice, large group sizes are not feasible due to computational limits, which biases learning toward trajectories that are already likely. Smaller groups often miss rare-correct trajectories while still containing mixed rewards, concentrating probability on common solutions. We derive the probability that updates miss rare-correct modes as a function of group size, showing non-monotonic behavior, and characterize how updates redistribute mass within the correct set, revealing that unsampled-correct mass can shrink even as total correct mass grows. Motivated by this analysis, we propose a difficulty-aware advantage scaling coefficient, inspired by Focal loss, that down-weights updates on high-success prompts. The lightweight modification can be directly integrated into any group-relative RLVR algorithm such as GRPO, DAPO, and CISPO. On Qwen2.5-7B across in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, our method improves pass@256 from 64.1 $\rightarrow$ 70.3 (GRPO), 69.3 $\rightarrow$ 72.5 (DAPO), and 73.2 $\rightarrow$ 76.8 (CISPO), while preserving or improving pass@1, without increasing group size or computational cost.

Abstract: Recent advancements in zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) have facilitated the extraction of diverse behaviors from unlabeled, offline data sources. In particular, forward-backward algorithms (FB) can retrieve a family of policies that can approximately solve any standard RL problem (with additive rewards, linear in the occupancy measure), given sufficient capacity. While retaining zero-shot properties, we tackle the greater problem class of RL with general utilities, in which the objective is an arbitrary differentiable function of the occupancy measure. This setting is strictly more expressive, capturing tasks such as distribution matching or pure exploration, which may not be reduced to additive rewards. We show that this additional complexity can be captured by a novel, maximum entropy (soft) variant of the forward-backward algorithm, which recovers a family of stochastic policies from offline data. When coupled with zero-order search over compact policy embeddings, this algorithm can sidestep iterative optimization schemes, and optimizes general utilities directly at test-time. Across both didactic and high-dimensional experiments, we demonstrate that our method retains favorable properties of FB algorithms, while also extending their range to more general RL problems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) shows promise for aligning diffusion and flow models, yet policy optimization methods such as GRPO suffer from inefficient and static sampling strategies. These methods treat all prompts and denoising steps uniformly, ignoring substantial variations in sample learning value as well as the dynamic nature of critical exploration moments.
  To address this issue, we conduct a detailed analysis of the internal attention dynamics during GRPO training and uncover a key insight: attention entropy can serve as a powerful dual-signal proxy. First, across different samples, the relative change in attention entropy (ΔEntropy), which reflects the divergence between the current policy and the base policy, acts as a robust indicator of sample learning value. Second, during the denoising process, the peaks of absolute attention entropy (Entropy(t)), which quantify attention dispersion, effectively identify critical timesteps where high-value exploration occurs.
  Building on this observation, we propose Adaptive Entropy-Guided Policy Optimization (AEGPO), a novel dual-signal, dual-level adaptive optimization strategy. At the global level, AEGPO uses ΔEntropy to dynamically allocate rollout budgets, prioritizing prompts with higher learning value. At the local level, it exploits the peaks of Entropy(t) to guide exploration selectively at critical high-dispersion timesteps rather than uniformly across all denoising steps.
  By focusing computation on the most informative samples and the most critical moments, AEGPO enables more efficient and effective policy optimization. Experiments on text-to-image generation tasks demonstrate that AEGPO significantly accelerates convergence and achieves superior alignment performance compared to standard GRPO variants.

Abstract: Concept erasure helps stop diffusion models (DMs) from generating harmful content; but current methods face robustness retention trade off. Robustness means the model fine-tuned by concept erasure methods resists reactivation of erased concepts, even under semantically related prompts. Retention means unrelated concepts are preserved so the model's overall utility stays intact. Both are critical for concept erasure in practice, yet addressing them simultaneously is challenging, as existing works typically improve one factor while sacrificing the other. Prior work typically strengthens one while degrading the other, e.g., mapping a single erased prompt to a fixed safe target leaves class level remnants exploitable by prompt attacks, whereas retention-oriented schemes underperform against adaptive adversaries. This paper introduces Adversarial Erasure with Gradient Informed Synergy (AEGIS), a retention-data-free framework that advances both robustness and retention.

Abstract: The smoothness of the transformer architecture has been extensively studied in the context of generalization, training stability, and adversarial robustness. However, its role in transfer learning remains poorly understood. In this paper, we analyze the ability of vision transformer components to adapt their outputs to changes in inputs, or, in other words, their plasticity. Defined as an average rate of change, it captures the sensitivity to input perturbation; in particular, a high plasticity implies low smoothness. We demonstrate through theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments that this perspective provides principled guidance in choosing the components to prioritize during adaptation. A key takeaway for practitioners is that the high plasticity of the attention modules and feedforward layers consistently leads to better finetuning performance. Our findings depart from the prevailing assumption that smoothness is desirable, offering a novel perspective on the functional properties of transformers.

Abstract: Multicalibration gradient boosting has recently emerged as a scalable method that empirically produces approximately multicalibrated predictors and has been deployed at web scale. Despite this empirical success, its convergence properties are not well understood. In this paper, we bridge the gap by providing convergence guarantees for multicalibration gradient boosting in regression with squared-error loss. We show that the magnitude of successive prediction updates decays at $O(1/\sqrt{T})$, which implies the same convergence rate bound for the multicalibration error over rounds. Under additional smoothness assumptions on the weak learners, this rate improves to linear convergence. We further analyze adaptive variants, showing local quadratic convergence of the training loss, and we study rescaling schemes that preserve convergence. Experiments on real-world datasets support our theory and clarify the regimes in which the method achieves fast convergence and strong multicalibration.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning robust classifiers where the classifier will receive a perturbed input. Unlike robust PAC learning studied in prior work, here the clean data and its label are also adversarially chosen. We formulate this setting as an online learning problem and consider both the realizable and agnostic learnability of hypothesis classes. We define a new dimension of classes and show it controls the mistake bounds in the realizable setting and the regret bounds in the agnostic setting. In contrast to the dimension that characterizes learnability in the PAC setting, our dimension is rather simple and resembles the Littlestone dimension. We generalize our dimension to multiclass hypothesis classes and prove similar results in the realizable case. Finally, we study the case where the learner does not know the set of allowed perturbations for each point and only has some prior on them.

Abstract: While lifting map has significantly enhanced the expressivity of graph neural networks, extending this paradigm to hypergraphs remains fragmented. To address this, we introduce the categorical Weisfeiler-Lehman framework, which formalizes lifting as a functorial mapping from an arbitrary data category to the unifying category of graded posets. When applied to hypergraphs, this perspective allows us to systematically derive Hypergraph Isomorphism Networks, a family of neural architectures where the message passing topology is strictly determined by the choice of functor. We introduce two distinct functors from the category of hypergraphs: an incidence functor and a symmetric simplicial complex functor. While the incidence architecture structurally mirrors standard bipartite schemes, our functorial derivation enforces a richer information flow over the resulting poset, capturing complex intersection geometries often missed by existing methods. We theoretically characterize the expressivity of these models, proving that both the incidence-based and symmetric simplicial approaches subsume the expressive power of the standard Hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman test. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks validate these theoretical findings.

Abstract: DPO and related algorithms align language models by directly optimizing the RLHF objective: find a policy that maximizes the Bradley-Terry reward while staying close to a reference policy through a KL divergence penalty. Previous work showed that this approach could be further generalized: the original problem remains tractable even if the KL divergence is replaced by a family of $f$-divergence with a convex generating function $f$. Our first contribution is to show that convexity of $f$ is not essential. Instead, we identify a more general condition, referred to as DPO-inducing, that precisely characterizes when the RLHF problem remains tractable. Our next contribution is to establish a second condition on $f$ that is necessary to prevent probability displacement, a known empirical phenomenon in which the probabilities of the winner and the loser responses approach zero. We refer to any $f$ that satisfies this condition as displacement-resistant. We finally focus on a specific DPO-inducing and displacement-resistant $f$, leading to our novel SquaredPO loss. Compared to DPO, this new loss offers stronger theoretical guarantees while performing competitively in practice.

Abstract: Being probabilistic models, during inference large language models (LLMs) display rare events: behaviour that is far from typical but highly significant. By definition all rare events are hard to see, but the enormous scale of LLM usage means that events completely unobserved during development are likely to become prominent in deployment. Here we present an end-to-end framework for the systematic analysis of rare events in LLMs. We provide a practical implementation spanning theory, efficient generation strategies, probability estimation and error analysis, which we illustrate with concrete examples. We outline extensions and applications to other models and contexts, highlighting the generality of the concepts and techniques presented here.

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is a fundamental component of modern weather prediction, yet it remains a major computational bottleneck in machine learning (ML)-based forecasting pipelines due to reliance on traditional variational methods. Recent generative ML-based DA methods offer a promising alternative but typically require many sampling steps and suffer from error accumulation under long-horizon auto-regressive rollouts with cycling assimilation. We propose FlowDA, a low-latency weather-scale generative DA framework based on flow matching. FlowDA conditions on observations through a SetConv-based embedding and fine-tunes the Aurora foundation model to deliver accurate, efficient, and robust analyses. Experiments across observation rates decreasing from $3.9\%$ to $0.1\%$ demonstrate superior performance of FlowDA over strong baselines with similar tunable-parameter size. FlowDA further shows robustness to observational noise and stable performance in long-horizon auto-regressive cycling DA. Overall, FlowDA points to an efficient and scalable direction for data-driven DA.

Abstract: Activation steering methods, such as persona vectors, are widely used to control large language model behavior and increasingly interpreted as revealing meaningful internal representations. This interpretation implicitly assumes steering directions are identifiable and uniquely recoverable from input-output behavior. We formalize steering as an intervention on internal representations and prove that, under realistic modeling and data conditions, steering vectors are fundamentally non-identifiable due to large equivalence classes of behaviorally indistinguishable interventions. Empirically, we validate this across multiple models and semantic traits, showing orthogonal perturbations achieve near-equivalent efficacy with negligible effect sizes. However, identifiability is recoverable under structural assumptions including statistical independence, sparsity constraints, multi-environment validation or cross-layer consistency. These findings reveal fundamental interpretability limits and clarify structural assumptions required for reliable safety-critical control.

Abstract: Tabular anomaly detection (TAD) remains challenging due to the heterogeneity of tabular data: features lack natural relationships, vary widely in distribution and scale, and exhibit diverse types. Consequently, each TAD method makes implicit assumptions about anomaly patterns that work well on some datasets but fail on others, and no method consistently outperforms across diverse scenarios. We present CTAD (Calibrating Tabular Anomaly Detection), a model-agnostic post-processing framework that enhances any existing TAD detector through sample-specific calibration. Our approach characterizes normal data via two complementary distributions, i.e., an empirical distribution from random sampling and a structural distribution from K-means centroids, and measures how adding a test sample disrupts their compatibility using Optimal Transport (OT) distance. Normal samples maintain low disruption while anomalies cause high disruption, providing a calibration signal to amplify detection. We prove that OT distance has a lower bound proportional to the test sample's distance from centroids, and establish that anomalies systematically receive higher calibration scores than normals in expectation, explaining why the method generalizes across datasets. Extensive experiments on 34 diverse tabular datasets with 7 representative detectors spanning all major TAD categories (density estimation, classification, reconstruction, and isolation-based methods) demonstrate that CTAD consistently improves performance with statistical significance. Remarkably, CTAD enhances even state-of-the-art deep learning methods and shows robust performance across diverse hyperparameter settings, requiring no additional tuning for practical deployment.

Abstract: Hybrid modeling, the combination of machine learning models and scientific mathematical models, enables flexible and robust data-driven prediction with partial interpretability. However, effectively the scientific models may be ignored in prediction due to the flexibility of the machine learning model, making the idea of hybrid modeling pointless. Typically some regularization is applied to hybrid model learning to avoid such a failure case, but the formulation of the regularizer strongly depends on model architectures and domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose to focus on the flatness of loss minima in learning hybrid models, aiming to make the model as simple as possible. We employ the idea of sharpness-aware minimization and adapt it to the hybrid modeling setting. Numerical experiments show that the SAM-based method works well across different choices of models and datasets.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative modeling on sequence data; however, the information-theoretic principles governing their reverse processes remain significantly less understood than those of their continuous counterparts. In this work, we bridge this gap by analyzing the reverse process dynamics through the lens of thermodynamic entropy production. We propose the entropy production rate as a rigorous proxy for quantifying information generation, deriving as a byproduct a bound on the Wasserstein distance between intermediate states and the data distribution. Leveraging these insights, we introduce two novel sampling schedules that are uniformly spaced with respect to their corresponding physics-inspired metrics: the Entropic Discrete Schedule (EDS), which is defined by maintaining a constant rate of information gain, and the Wasserstein Discrete Schedule (WDS), which is defined by taking equal steps in terms of the Wasserstein distance. We empirically demonstrate that our proposed schedules significantly outperform state-of-the-art strategies across diverse application domains, including synthetic data, music notation, vision and language modeling, consistently achieving superior performance at a lower computational budget.

Abstract: The loss function is crucial to machine learning, especially in supervised learning frameworks. It is a fundamental component that controls the behavior and general efficacy of learning algorithms. However, despite their widespread use, traditional loss functions have significant drawbacks when dealing with high-dimensional and outlier-sensitive datasets, which frequently results in reduced performance and slower convergence during training. In this work, we develop a robust, bounded, and smooth (RoBoS-NN) loss function to resolve the aforementioned hindrances. The generalization ability of the loss function has also been theoretically analyzed to rigorously justify its robustness. Moreover, we implement RoboS-NN loss in the framework of a neural network (NN) to forecast time series and present a new robust algorithm named $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RoBoS}}$-NN. To assess the potential of $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RoBoS}}$-NN, we conduct experiments on multiple real-world datasets. In addition, we infuse outliers into data sets to evaluate the performance of $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RoBoS}}$-NN in more challenging scenarios. Numerical results show that $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RoBoS}}$-NN outperforms the other benchmark models in terms of accuracy measures.

Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to identify irregular patterns in graph data, and recent works have explored zero-shot generalist GAD to enable generalization to unseen graph datasets. However, existing zero-shot GAD methods largely ignore intrinsic geometric differences across diverse anomaly patterns, substantially limiting their cross-domain generalization. In this work, we reveal that anomaly detectability is highly dependent on the underlying geometric properties and that embedding graphs from different domains into a single static curvature space can distort the structural signatures of anomalies. To address the challenge that a single curvature space cannot capture geometry-dependent graph anomaly patterns, we propose GAD-MoRE, a novel framework for zero-shot Generalizable Graph Anomaly Detection with a Mixture of Riemannian Experts architecture. Specifically, to ensure that each anomaly pattern is modeled in the Riemannian space where it is most detectable, GAD-MoRE employs a set of specialized Riemannian expert networks, each operating in a distinct curvature space. To align raw node features with curvature-specific anomaly characteristics, we introduce an anomaly-aware multi-curvature feature alignment module that projects inputs into parallel Riemannian spaces, enabling the capture of diverse geometric characteristics. Finally, to facilitate better generalization beyond seen patterns, we design a memory-based dynamic router that adaptively assigns each input to the most compatible expert based on historical reconstruction performance on similar anomalies. Extensive experiments in the zero-shot setting demonstrate that GAD-MoRE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art generalist GAD baselines, and even surpasses strong competitors that are few-shot fine-tuned with labeled data from the target domain.

Abstract: Reliable short-term demand forecasting is essential for managing shared micro-mobility services and ensuring responsive, user-centered operations. This study introduces T-STAR (Two-stage Spatial and Temporal Adaptive contextual Representation), a novel transformer-based probabilistic framework designed to forecast station-level bike-sharing demand at a 15-minute resolution. T-STAR addresses key challenges in high-resolution forecasting by disentangling consistent demand patterns from short-term fluctuations through a hierarchical two-stage structure. The first stage captures coarse-grained hourly demand patterns, while the second stage improves prediction accuracy by incorporating high-frequency, localized inputs, including recent fluctuations and real-time demand variations in connected metro services, to account for temporal shifts in short-term demand. Time series transformer models are employed in both stages to generate probabilistic predictions. Extensive experiments using Washington D.C.'s Capital Bikeshare data demonstrate that T-STAR outperforms existing methods in both deterministic and probabilistic accuracy. The model exhibits strong spatial and temporal robustness across stations and time periods. A zero-shot forecasting experiment further highlights T-STAR's ability to transfer to previously unseen service areas without retraining. These results underscore the framework's potential to deliver granular, reliable, and uncertainty-aware short-term demand forecasts, which enable seamless integration to support multimodal trip planning for travelers and enhance real-time operations in shared micro-mobility services.

Abstract: Adaptive methods like Adam have become the $\textit{de facto}$ standard for large-scale vector and Euclidean optimization due to their coordinate-wise adaptation with a second-order nature. More recently, matrix-based spectral optimizers like Muon (Jordan et al., 2024b) show the power of treating weight matrices as matrices rather than long vectors. Linking these is hard because many natural generalizations are not feasible to implement, and we also cannot simply move the Adam adaptation to the matrix spectrum. To address this, we reformulate the AdaGrad update and decompose it into a variance adaptation term and a scale-invariant term. This decoupling produces $\textbf{DeVA}$ ($\textbf{De}$coupled $\textbf{V}$ariance $\textbf{A}$daptation), a framework that bridges between vector-based variance adaptation and matrix spectral optimization, enabling a seamless transition from Adam to adaptive spectral descent. Extensive experiments across language modeling and image classification demonstrate that DeVA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as Muon and SOAP (Vyas et al., 2024), reducing token usage by around 6.6\%. Theoretically, we show that the variance adaptation term effectively improves the blockwise smoothness, facilitating faster convergence.

Abstract: Image-based patient-specific simulation of left ventricular (LV) mechanics is valuable for understanding cardiac function and supporting clinical intervention planning, but conventional finite-element analysis (FEA) is computationally intensive. Current graph-based surrogates do not have full-cycle prediction capabilities, and physics-informed neural networks often struggle to converge on complex cardiac geometries. We present CardioGraphFENet (CGFENet), a unified graph-based surrogate for rapid full-cycle estimation of LV myocardial biomechanics, supervised by a large FEA simulation dataset. The proposed model integrates (i) a global--local graph encoder to capture mesh features with weak-form-inspired global coupling, (ii) a gated recurrent unit-based temporal encoder conditioned on the target volume-time signal to model cycle-coherent dynamics, and (iii) a cycle-consistent bidirectional formulation for both loading and inverse unloading within a single framework. These strategies enable high fidelity with respect to traditional FEA ground truths and produce physiologically plausible pressure-volume loops that match FEA results when coupled with a lumped-parameter model. In particular, the cycle-consistency strategy enables a significant reduction in FEA supervision with only minimal loss in accuracy.

Abstract: Recovering a unique causal graph from observational data is an ill-posed problem because multiple generating mechanisms can lead to the same observational distribution. This problem becomes solvable only by exploiting specific structural or distributional assumptions. While recent work has separately utilized time-series dynamics or multi-environment heterogeneity to constrain this problem, we integrate both as complementary sources of heterogeneity. This integration yields unified necessary identifiability conditions and enables a rigorous analysis of the statistical limits of recovery under thin versus heavy-tailed noise. In particular, temporal structure is shown to effectively substitute for missing environmental diversity, possibly achieving identifiability even under insufficient heterogeneity. Extending this analysis to heavy-tailed (Student's t) distributions, we demonstrate that while geometric identifiability conditions remain invariant, the sample complexity diverges significantly from the Gaussian baseline. Explicit information-theoretic bounds quantify this cost of robustness, establishing the fundamental limits of covariance-based causal graph recovery methods in realistic non-stationary systems. This work shifts the focus from whether causal structure is identifiable to whether it is statistically recoverable in practice.

Abstract: In this paper, we study dynamic regret in unconstrained online convex optimization (OCO) with movement costs. Specifically, we generalize the standard setting by allowing the movement cost coefficients $λ_t$ to vary arbitrarily over time. Our main contribution is a novel algorithm that establishes the first comparator-adaptive dynamic regret bound for this setting, guaranteeing $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{(1+P_T)(T+\sum_t λ_t)})$ regret, where $P_T$ is the path length of the comparator sequence over $T$ rounds. This recovers the optimal guarantees for both static and dynamic regret in standard OCO as a special case where $λ_t=0$ for all rounds. To demonstrate the versatility of our results, we consider two applications: OCO with delayed feedback and OCO with time-varying memory. We show that both problems can be translated into time-varying movement costs, establishing a novel reduction specifically for the delayed feedback setting that is of independent interest. A crucial observation is that the first-order dependence on movement costs in our regret bound plays a key role in enabling optimal comparator-adaptive dynamic regret guarantees in both settings.

Abstract: Background: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a powerful tool to investigate neurophysiology of the human brain and treat brain disorders. Traditionally, therapeutic TMS has been applied in a one-size-fits-all approach, disregarding inter- and intra-individual differences. Brain state-dependent EEG-TMS, such as coupling TMS with a pre-specified phase of the sensorimotor mu-rhythm, enables the induction of differential neuroplastic effects depending on the targeted phase. But this approach is still user-dependent as it requires defining an a-priori target phase. Objectives: To present a first realization of a machine-learning-based, closed-loop real-time EEG-TMS setup to identify user-independently the individual mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low-corticospinal excitability states. Methods: We applied EEG-TMS to 25 participants targeting the supplementary motor area-primary motor cortex network and used a reinforcement learning algorithm to identify the mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low corticospinal excitability. We employed linear mixed effects models and Bayesian analysis to determine effects of reinforced learning on corticospinal excitability indexed by motor evoked potential amplitude, and functional connectivity indexed by the imaginary part of resting-state EEG coherence. Results: Reinforcement learning effectively identified the mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low-excitability states, and their repetitive stimulation resulted in long-term increases vs. decreases in functional connectivity in the stimulated sensorimotor network. Conclusions: We demonstrated for the first time the feasibility of closed-loop EEG-TMS in humans, a critical step towards individualized treatment of brain disorders.

Abstract: The recent surge in Time Series Foundation Models has rapidly advanced the field, yet the heterogeneous training setups across studies make it difficult to attribute improvements to architectural innovations versus data engineering. In this work, we investigate the potential of a standard patch Transformer, demonstrating that this generic architecture achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasting performance using a straightforward training protocol. We conduct a comprehensive ablation study that covers model scaling, data composition, and training techniques to isolate the essential ingredients for high performance. Our findings identify the key drivers of performance, while confirming that the generic architecture itself demonstrates excellent scalability. By strictly controlling these variables, we provide comprehensive empirical results on model scaling across multiple dimensions. We release our open-source model and detailed findings to establish a transparent, reproducible baseline for future research.

Abstract: Can general-purpose AI architectures go beyond prediction to discover the physical laws governing the universe? True intelligence relies on "world models" -- causal abstractions that allow an agent to not only predict future states but understand the underlying governing dynamics. While previous "AI Physicist" approaches have successfully recovered such laws, they typically rely on strong, domain-specific priors that effectively "bake in" the physics. Conversely, Vafa et al. recently showed that generic Transformers fail to acquire these world models, achieving high predictive accuracy without capturing the underlying physical laws. We bridge this gap by systematically introducing three minimal inductive biases. We show that ensuring spatial smoothness (by formulating prediction as continuous regression) and stability (by training with noisy contexts to mitigate error accumulation) enables generic Transformers to surpass prior failures and learn a coherent Keplerian world model, successfully fitting ellipses to planetary trajectories. However, true physical insight requires a third bias: temporal locality. By restricting the attention window to the immediate past -- imposing the simple assumption that future states depend only on the local state rather than a complex history -- we force the model to abandon curve-fitting and discover Newtonian force representations. Our results demonstrate that simple architectural choices determine whether an AI becomes a curve-fitter or a physicist, marking a critical step toward automated scientific discovery.

Abstract: Deep learning models trained to optimize average accuracy often exhibit systematic failures on particular subpopulations. In real world settings, the subpopulations most affected by such disparities are frequently unlabeled or unknown, thereby motivating the development of methods that are performant on sensitive subgroups without being pre-specified. However, existing group-robust methods typically assume prior knowledge of relevant subgroups, using group annotations for training or model selection. We propose Low-rank Error Informed Adaptation (LEIA), a simple two-stage method that improves group robustness by identifying a low-dimensional subspace in the representation space where model errors concentrate. LEIA restricts adaptation to this error-informed subspace via a low-rank adjustment to the classifier logits, directly targeting latent failure modes without modifying the backbone or requiring group labels. Using five real-world datasets, we analyze group robustness under three settings: (1) truly no knowledge of subgroup relevance, (2) partial knowledge of subgroup relevance, and (3) full knowledge of subgroup relevance. Across all settings, LEIA consistently improves worst-group performance while remaining fast, parameter-efficient, and robust to hyperparameter choice.

Abstract: Non-Markovian dynamics are commonly found in real-world environments due to long-range dependencies, partial observability, and memory effects. The Bellman equation that is the central pillar of Reinforcement learning (RL) becomes only approximately valid under Non-Markovian. Existing work often focus on practical algorithm designs and offer limited theoretical treatment to address key questions, such as what dynamics are indeed capturable by the Bellman framework and how to inspire new algorithm classes with optimal approximations. In this paper, we present a novel topological viewpoint on temporal-difference (TD) based RL. We show that TD errors can be viewed as 1-cochain in the topological space of state transitions, while Markov dynamics are then interpreted as topological integrability. This novel view enables us to obtain a Hodge-type decomposition of TD errors into an integrable component and a topological residual, through a Bellman-de Rham projection. We further propose HodgeFlow Policy Search (HFPS) by fitting a potential network to minimize the non-integrable projection residual in RL, achieving stability/sensitivity guarantees. In numerical evaluations, HFPS is shown to significantly improve RL performance under non-Markovian.

Abstract: We study off-policy reinforcement learning for controlling continuous-time Markov diffusion processes with discrete-time observations and actions. We consider model-free algorithms with function approximation that learn value and advantage functions directly from data, without unrealistic structural assumptions on the dynamics.
  Leveraging the ellipticity of the diffusions, we establish a new class of Hilbert-space positive definiteness and boundedness properties for the Bellman operators. Based on these properties, we propose the Sobolev-prox fitted $q$-learning algorithm, which learns value and advantage functions by iteratively solving least-squares regression problems. We derive oracle inequalities for the estimation error, governed by (i) the best approximation error of the function classes, (ii) their localized complexity, (iii) exponentially decaying optimization error, and (iv) numerical discretization error. These results identify ellipticity as a key structural property that renders reinforcement learning with function approximation for Markov diffusions no harder than supervised learning.

Abstract: Speculative decoding can significantly accelerate LLM serving, yet most deployments today disentangle speculator training from serving, treating speculator training as a standalone offline modeling problem. We show that this decoupled formulation introduces substantial deployment and adaptation lag: (1) high time-to-serve, since a speculator must be trained offline for a considerable period before deployment; (2) delayed utility feedback, since the true end-to-end decoding speedup is only known after training and cannot be inferred reliably from acceptance rate alone due to model-architecture and system-level overheads; and (3) domain-drift degradation, as the target model is repurposed to new domains and the speculator becomes stale and less effective.
  To address these issues, we present Aurora, a unified training-serving system that closes the loop by continuously learning a speculator directly from live inference traces. Aurora reframes online speculator learning as an asynchronous reinforcement-learning problem: accepted tokens provide positive feedback, while rejected speculator proposals provide implicit negative feedback that we exploit to improve sample efficiency. Our design integrates an SGLang-based inference server with an asynchronous training server, enabling hot-swapped speculator updates without service interruption. Crucially, Aurora supports day-0 deployment: a speculator can be served immediately and rapidly adapted to live traffic, improving system performance while providing immediate utility feedback. Across experiments, Aurora achieves a 1.5x day-0 speedup on recently released frontier models (e.g., MiniMax M2.1 229B and Qwen3-Coder-Next 80B). Aurora also adapts effectively to distribution shifts in user traffic, delivering an additional 1.25x speedup over a well-trained but static speculator on widely used models (e.g., Qwen3 and Llama3).

Abstract: Learning unsupervised representations that are both semantically meaningful and stable across runs remains a central challenge in modern representation learning. We introduce entropy-ordered flows (EOFlows), a normalizing-flow framework that orders latent dimensions by their explained entropy, analogously to PCA's explained variance. This ordering enables adaptive injective flows: after training, one may retain only the top C latent variables to form a compact core representation while the remaining variables capture fine-grained detail and noise, with C chosen flexibly at inference time rather than fixed during training. EOFlows build on insights from Independent Mechanism Analysis, Principal Component Flows and Manifold Entropic Metrics. We combine likelihood-based training with local Jacobian regularization and noise augmentation into a method that scales well to high-dimensional data such as images. Experiments on the CelebA dataset show that our method uncovers a rich set of semantically interpretable features, allowing for high compression and strong denoising.

Abstract: Addressing class imbalance is a central challenge in credit card fraud detection, as it directly impacts predictive reliability in real-world financial systems. To overcome this, the study proposes an enhanced workflow based on the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM)-a transparent, state-of-the-art implementation of the GA2M algorithm-optimized through systematic hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and preprocessing refinement. Rather than relying on conventional sampling techniques that may introduce bias or cause information loss, the optimized EBM achieves an effective balance between accuracy and interpretability, enabling precise detection of fraudulent transactions while providing actionable insights into feature importance and interaction effects. Furthermore, the Taguchi method is employed to optimize both the sequence of data scalers and model hyperparameters, ensuring robust, reproducible, and systematically validated performance improvements. Experimental evaluation on benchmark credit card data yields an ROC-AUC of 0.983, surpassing prior EBM baselines (0.975) and outperforming Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree models. These results highlight the potential of interpretable machine learning and data-driven optimization for advancing trustworthy fraud analytics in financial systems.
