In the setting of Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT), one\nof the limitations of the traditional notion of CwFs is the requirement to\nset-truncate types, which excludes models based on univalent categories, such\nas the standard set model. To address this limitation, we introduce the concept\nof a Groupoid Category with Families (GCwF). This framework truncates types at\nthe groupoid level and incorporates coherence equations, providing a natural\nextension of the CwF framework when starting from a 1-category.\n  We demonstrate that the initial GCwF for a type theory with a base family of\nsets and Pi-types (groupoid-syntax) is set-truncated. Consequently, this allows\nus to utilize the conventional intrinsic syntax of type theory while enabling\ninterpretations in semantically richer and more natural models.

It offers insights into\ncollective behavior and decision-making, with applications in Graph Neural\nNetworks. Existing models propose that individuals form opinions based on a\nweighted average of their peers' opinions and their own beliefs. This averaging\nprocess, viewed as a best-response game, can be seen as an individual\nminimizing disagreements with peers, defined by a quadratic penalty, leading to\nan equilibrium. Bindel, Kleinberg, and Oren (FOCS 2011) provided tight bounds\non the \"price of anarchy\" defined as the maximum overall disagreement at\nequilibrium relative to a social optimum. Bhawalkar, Gollapudi, and Munagala\n(STOC 2013) generalized the penalty function to non-quadratic penalties and\nprovided tight bounds on the price of anarchy.\n  When considering multiple topics, an individual's opinions can be represented\nas a vector. Parsegov, Proskurnikov, Tempo, and Friedkin (2016) proposed a\nmultidimensional model using the weighted averaging process, but with constant\ninterdependencies between topics. However, the question of the price of anarchy\nfor this model remained open. We address this by providing tight bounds on the\nmultidimensional model, while also generalizing it to more complex\ninterdependencies. Following the work of Bhawalkar, Gollapudi, and Munagala, we\nprovide tight bounds on the price of anarchy under non-quadratic penalties.\nSurprisingly, these bounds match the scalar model.

Our experiments reveal universal failure patterns:\nnegative rewards produce extreme underconfidence (ECE greater than 0.8) while\ndestroying confidence diversity (std less than 0.05), symmetric losses fail to\nescape binary signal averaging, and post-hoc methods achieve calibration (ECE\nless than 0.02) only by compressing the confidence distribution.

LLMs tend to\ngenerate hallucinations, a seemingly plausible yet factually unsupported output\n[Hua+24], which have serious real-world consequences [Kay23; Rum+24]. Recent\nwork has shown that probing-based classifiers that utilize LLMs' internal\nrepresentations can detect hallucinations [AM23; Bei+24; Bur+24; DYT24; Ji+24;\nSMZ24; Su+24]. This approach, since it does not involve model training, can\nenhance reliability without significantly increasing computational costs.\n  Building upon this approach, this thesis proposed novel methods for\nhallucination detection using LLM internal representations and evaluated them\nacross three benchmarks: TruthfulQA, HaluEval, and ReFact. Specifically, a new\narchitecture that dynamically weights and combines internal LLM layers was\ndeveloped to improve hallucination detection performance. Throughout extensive\nexperiments, two key findings were obtained: First, the proposed approach was\nshown to achieve superior performance compared to traditional probing methods,\nthough generalization across benchmarks and LLMs remains challenging. Second,\nthese generalization limitations were demonstrated to be mitigated through\ncross-benchmark training and parameter freezing. While not consistently\nimproving, both techniques yielded better performance on individual benchmarks\nand reduced performance degradation when transferred to other benchmarks. These\nfindings open new avenues for improving LLM reliability through internal\nrepresentation analysis."}

While game-theoretic properties can explain why certain teams or agent\npopulations outperform others, more abstract behaviours, such as convention\nfollowing, are harder to control in training and evaluation settings. The\nMelting Pot contest is a social AI evaluation suite designed to assess the\ncooperation capabilities of AI systems. In this paper, we apply a Bayesian\napproach known as Measurement Layouts to infer the capability profiles of\nmulti-agent systems in the Melting Pot contest. We show that these capability\nprofiles not only predict future performance within the Melting Pot suite but\nalso reveal the underlying prosocial abilities of agents. Our analysis\nindicates that while higher prosocial capabilities sometimes correlate with\nbetter performance, this is not a universal trend-some lower-scoring agents\nexhibit stronger cooperation abilities. Furthermore, we find that\ntop-performing contest submissions are more likely to achieve high scores in\nscenarios where prosocial capabilities are not required. These findings,\ntogether with reports that the contest winner used a hard-coded solution\ntailored to specific environments, suggest that at least one top-performing\nteam may have optimised for conditions where cooperation was not necessary,\npotentially exploiting limitations in the evaluation framework.

We prove that if\nthe decoding step of DQI corrects up to the folklore efficient decoding\nthreshold for LDPC codes, then DQI is obstructed by a topological feature of\nthe near-optimal space of solutions known as the overlap gap property (OGP). As\nthe OGP is widely conjectured to exactly characterize the performance of\nstate-of-the-art classical algorithms, this result suggests that DQI has no\nquantum advantage in optimizing unstructured MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT instances. We also\ngive numerical evidence supporting this conjecture by showing that approximate\nmessage passing (AMP)--a classical algorithm conjectured to saturate the OGP\nthreshold--outperforms DQI on a related ensemble of MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT instances.\nFinally, we prove that depth-$1$ QAOA outperforms DQI at sufficiently large $k$\nunder the same decoding threshold assumption.\n  Our result follows by showing that DQI is approximately Lipschitz under the\nquantum Wasserstein metric over many standard ensembles of codes.

We study the problem of deception, where an agent pursues a\nprivate objective while remaining plausibly compliant with a supervisor's\nreference policy when observations occur. Motivated by the behavior of real,\nhuman supervisors, we situate the problem within Theory of Mind: the\nrepresentation of what an observer believes and expects to see. We show that\nTheory of Mind can be repurposed to steer online reinforcement learning (RL)\ntoward such deceptive behavior.

This scalar combines how unlike\nthe reference and current action distributions appear, with the agent's belief\nthat an observation is imminent. Injected as a state-dependent weight into a\nKL-regularized policy improvement step within an online RL loop, this scalar\ninforms a closed-form update that smoothly trades off self-interest and\ncompliance, thus sidestepping hand-crafted or heuristic policies.

Using\ntime-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), we reveal that laser induced\nultrafast demagnetization dynamics in the g-wave AM CrSb are strongly governed\nby the laser incidence direction. Under normal incidence along the [0001] axis,\ntwo Cr sublattices exhibit symmetric temporal demagnetization but with\ndifferent amplitudes, preserving the net-zero magnetization, unlike the\nbehavior in d-wave AM. Off-normal incidence, however, induces pronounced\nasymmetric demagnetization between sublattices, transiently driving the system\ninto a ferrimagnetic-like state with a sizable net magnetization. This\ndirection-dependent response arises from the characteristic nodal structures in\nbulk g-wave AM electronic structure, which enable anisotropic optical intersite\nspin transfer (OISTR). By comparing g-wave and d-wave AMs, we propose that\nlight-induced magnetization arises when laser polarization aligns with\nspin-uncompensated regions in electronic structures.

A key innovation is treating\nmicrostructure as a stochastic process, defined as a distribution of\nmicrostructural instances rather than a single image, enabling the extraction\nof material state descriptors that capture the essential process-dependent\nfeatures. We leverage the manifold hypothesis to assert that microstructural\noutcomes lie on a low-dimensional latent space controlled by only a few\nparameters. Using phase-field simulations of spinodal decomposition as a model\nmaterial system, we compare multiple microstructure descriptors (two-point\nstatistics, chord-length distributions, and persistent homology) in terms of\ntwo criteria: (1) intrinsic dimensionality of the latent space, and (2)\ninvertibility of the processing-to-structure mapping. The results demonstrate\nthat distribution-based descriptors can recover a two-dimensional latent\nstructure aligned with the true processing parameters, yielding an invertible\nand physically interpretable mapping between processing and microstructure. In\ncontrast, descriptors that do not account for microstructure variability either\noverestimate dimensionality or lose predictive fidelity.

A central component of\nthis framework is a network of Sentinel Agents, functioning as a distributed\nsecurity layer that integrates techniques such as semantic analysis via large\nlanguage models (LLMs), behavioral analytics, retrieval-augmented verification,\nand cross-agent anomaly detection. Such agents can potentially oversee\ninter-agent communications, identify potential threats, enforce privacy and\naccess controls, and maintain comprehensive audit records. Complementary to the\nidea of Sentinel Agents is the use of a Coordinator Agent. The Coordinator\nAgent supervises policy implementation, and manages agent participation. In\naddition, the Coordinator also ingests alerts from Sentinel Agents. Based on\nthese alerts, it can adapt policies, isolate or quarantine misbehaving agents,\nand contain threats to maintain the integrity of the MAS ecosystem. This\ndual-layered security approach, combining the continuous monitoring of Sentinel\nAgents with the governance functions of Coordinator Agents, supports dynamic\nand adaptive defense mechanisms against a range of threats, including prompt\ninjection, collusive agent behavior, hallucinations generated by LLMs, privacy\nbreaches, and coordinated multi-agent attacks. In addition to the architectural\ndesign, we present a simulation study where 162 synthetic attacks of different\nfamilies (prompt injection, hallucination, and data exfiltration) were injected\ninto a multi-agent conversational environment. The Sentinel Agents successfully\ndetected the attack attempts, confirming the practical feasibility of the\nproposed monitoring approach. The framework also offers enhanced system\nobservability, supports regulatory compliance, and enables policy evolution\nover time."}

In this paper, we propose a\nnovel Chain-of-Thought Re-Ranking (CoTRR) method to address this issue.\nSpecifically, we design a listwise ranking prompt that enables MLLM to directly\nparticipate in re-ranking candidate images. This ranking process is grounded in\nan image evaluation prompt, which assesses how well each candidate aligns with\nusers query. By allowing MLLM to perform listwise reasoning, our method\nsupports global comparison, consistent reasoning, and interpretable\ndecision-making - all of which are essential for accurate image retrieval.

MIRAGE samples human-written texts from 10 corpora\nacross 5 text-domains, which are then re-generated or revised using 17\ncutting-edge LLMs, covering a wide spectrum of proprietary models and textual\nstyles. Extensive experiments on MIRAGE reveal the limitations of existing\nmethods in complex environment. In contrast, DetectAnyLLM consistently\noutperforms them, achieving over a 70% performance improvement under the same\ntraining data and base scoring model, underscoring the effectiveness of our\nDDL.

The\nFRoundation model with the ViT-L backbone outperforms other approaches on the\nlarge-scale FR benchmark IJB-C, achieving an improvement of up to 58.52%.\nHowever, it experiences a substantial performance drop on ImageNetV2, reaching\nonly 51.63% compared to 69.84% achieved by the baseline CLIP model.

We find that\nconventional TEM imaging can saturate the quantum bound when backaction of the\nprobe electron onto the spin state is negligible. We also find that, when\nbackaction is relevant, one could do better by realizing a measurement of the\nelectron's orbital angular momentum state. These results establish the quantum\nlimits of spin sensing in TEM and guide the development of future experiments\nprobing individual electron spins or nanoscale ensembles of nuclear spins."}

Solving it requires addressing three key\nchallenges: the non-convexity of free space due to obstacles,\nquadrotor-specific dynamics and objectives, and the need for exploration of\nunknown regions to find a path to the goal. Recently, the Model Predictive Path\nIntegral (MPPI) method has emerged as a promising solution that solves the\nfirst two challenges. By leveraging sampling-based optimization, it can\neffectively handle non-convex free space while directly optimizing over the\nfull quadrotor dynamics, enabling the inclusion of quadrotor-specific costs\nsuch as energy consumption. However, its performance in unknown environments is\nlimited, as it lacks the ability to explore unknown regions when blocked by\nlarge obstacles. To solve this issue, we introduce Perception-Aware MPPI\n(PA-MPPI). Here, perception-awareness is defined as adapting the trajectory\nonline based on perception objectives. Specifically, when the goal is occluded,\nPA-MPPI's perception cost biases trajectories that can perceive unknown\nregions.

However, most current VLA-based embodied agents operate in a one-way\nmode: they receive an instruction and execute it without feedback. This\napproach fails in real-world scenarios where instructions are often ambiguous.\nIn this paper, we address this problem with the Ask-to-Clarify framework. Our\nframework first resolves ambiguous instructions by asking questions in a\nmulti-turn dialogue. Then it generates low-level actions end-to-end.\nSpecifically, the Ask-to-Clarify framework consists of two components, one VLM\nfor collaboration and one diffusion for action. We also introduce a connection\nmodule that generates conditions for the diffusion based on the output of the\nVLM. This module adjusts the observation by instructions to create reliable\nconditions. We train our framework with a two-stage knowledge-insulation\nstrategy. First, we fine-tune the collaboration component using\nambiguity-solving dialogue data to handle ambiguity.

To address\nthis, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis, uncovering the\ncomplementary weaknesses of GNN and Transformer in graph clustering. Motivated\nby these insights, we propose the Attentive Graph Clustering Network (AGCN) a\nnovel architecture that reinterprets the notion that graph is attention. AGCN\ndirectly embeds the attention mechanism into the graph structure, enabling\neffective global information extraction while maintaining sensitivity to local\ntopological cues. Our framework incorporates theoretical analysis to contrast\nAGCN behavior with GNN and Transformer and introduces two innovations: (1) a KV\ncache mechanism to improve computational efficiency, and (2) a pairwise margin\ncontrastive loss to boost the discriminative capacity of the attention space.\nExtensive experimental results demonstrate that AGCN outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods."}

We introduce MSDD, a high-quality aerial image\ndataset for maize seedling stand counting, with applications in early-season\ncrop monitoring, yield prediction, and in-field management. Stand counting\ndetermines how many plants germinated, guiding timely decisions such as\nreplanting or adjusting inputs. Traditional methods are labor-intensive and\nerror-prone, while computer vision enables efficient, accurate detection. MSDD\ncontains three classes-single, double, and triple plants-capturing diverse\ngrowth stages, planting setups, soil types, lighting conditions, camera angles,\nand densities, ensuring robustness for real-world use. Benchmarking shows\ndetection is most reliable during V4-V6 stages and under nadir views. Among\ntested models, YOLO11 is fastest, while YOLOv9 yields the highest accuracy for\nsingle plants. Single plant detection achieves precision up to 0.984 and recall\nup to 0.873, but detecting doubles and triples remains difficult due to rarity\nand irregular appearance, often from planting errors. Class imbalance further\nreduces accuracy in multi-plant detection. Despite these challenges, YOLO11\nmaintains efficient inference at 35 ms per image, with an additional 120 ms for\nsaving outputs. MSDD establishes a strong foundation for developing models that\nenhance stand counting, optimize resource allocation, and support real-time\ndecision-making. This dataset marks a step toward automating agricultural\nmonitoring and advancing precision agriculture."}

In a novel benchmark, we elicit probabilities from 4 models and\ncompute minimal-pair surprisal differences, juxtaposing probabilities assigned\nto grammatical sentences to probabilities assigned to (i) lower frequency\ngrammatical sentences, (ii) ungrammatical sentences, (iii) semantically odd\nsentences, and (iv) pragmatically odd sentences. The prediction is that if\nstring-probabilities can function as proxies for the limits of grammar, the\nungrammatical condition will stand out among the conditions that involve\nlinguistic violations, showing a spike in the surprisal rates. Our results do\nnot reveal a unique surprisal signature for ungrammatical prompts, as the\nsemantically and pragmatically odd conditions consistently show higher\nsurprisal. We thus demonstrate that probabilities do not constitute reliable\nproxies for model-internal representations of syntactic knowledge.\nConsequently, claims about models being able to distinguish possible from\nimpossible language need verification through a different methodology."}

We aim to develop an AI-based\nmodel that predicts biological age from CTG time series (named CTGage), then\ncalculate the age gap between CTGage and actual age (named CTGage-gap), and use\nthis gap as a new digital biomarker for future adverse pregnancy outcomes. The\nCTGage model is developed using 61,140 records from 11,385 pregnant women,\ncollected at Peking University People's Hospital between 2018 and 2022. For\nmodel training, a structurally designed 1D convolutional neural network is\nused, incorporating distribution-aligned augmented regression technology. The\nCTGage-gap is categorized into five groups: < -21 days (underestimation group),\n-21 to -7 days, -7 to 7 days (normal group), 7 to 21 days, and > 21 days\n(overestimation group). We further defined the underestimation group and\noverestimation group together as the high-risk group. We then compare the\nincidence of adverse outcomes and maternal diseases across these groups. The\naverage absolute error of the CTGage model is 10.91 days. When comparing the\noverestimation group with the normal group, premature infants incidence is\n5.33% vs. 1.42% (p < 0.05) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) incidence is\n31.93% vs. 20.86% (p < 0.05). When comparing the underestimation group with the\nnormal group, low birth weight incidence is 0.17% vs. 0.15% (p < 0.05) and\nanaemia incidence is 37.51% vs. 34.74% (p < 0.05). Artificial\nintelligence-derived CTGage can predict the future risk of adverse pregnancy\noutcomes and hold potential as a novel, non-invasive, and easily accessible\ndigital biomarker."}

To address these challenges, here we propose\na deep learning framework, dubbed Titan, which identifies and freezes inactive\nparameters of a given ansatze at initialization for a specific class of\nHamiltonians, reducing the optimization overhead without sacrificing accuracy.\nThe motivation of Titan starts with our empirical findings that a subset of\nparameters consistently has a negligible influence on training dynamics. Its\ndesign combines a theoretically grounded data construction strategy, ensuring\neach training example is informative and BP-resilient, with an adaptive neural\narchitecture that generalizes across ansatze of varying sizes. Across benchmark\ntransverse-field Ising models, Heisenberg models, and multiple molecule systems\nup to 30 qubits, Titan achieves up to 3 times faster convergence and 40% to 60%\nfewer circuit evaluations than state-of-the-art baselines, while matching or\nsurpassing their estimation accuracy.

Diffusion-based language models offer a promising\nalternative, as they can decode multiple tokens in parallel. However, we\nidentify a key bottleneck in current diffusion LMs: the long decoding-window\nproblem, where tokens generated far from the input context often become\nirrelevant or repetitive. Previous solutions like semi-autoregressive address\nthis issue by splitting windows into blocks, but this sacrifices speed and\nbidirectionality, eliminating the main advantage of diffusion models. To\novercome this, we propose Convolutional decoding (Conv), a normalization-based\nmethod that narrows the decoding window without hard segmentation, leading to\nbetter fluency and flexibility. Additionally, we introduce Rejecting Rule-based\nFine-Tuning (R2FT), a post-hoc training scheme that better aligns tokens at\npositions far from context. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art results on\nopen-ended generation benchmarks (e.g., AlpacaEval) among diffusion LM\nbaselines, with significantly lower step size than previous works,\ndemonstrating both speed and quality improvements."}

Despite recent advancements, these models\nstill struggle to solve complex geometric problems. A key challenge stems from\nthe lack of high-quality image-text pair datasets for understanding geometric\nimages. Furthermore, most template-based data synthesis pipelines typically\nfail to generalize to questions beyond their predefined templates. In this\npaper, we bridge this gap by introducing a complementary process of\nReinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) into the data generation\npipeline. By adopting RLVR to refine captions for geometric images synthesized\nfrom 50 basic geometric relations and using reward signals derived from\nmathematical problem-solving tasks, our pipeline successfully captures the key\nfeatures of geometry problem-solving. This enables better task generalization\nand yields non-trivial improvements.

Existing methods often rely on complete and noise-free\nobservational data, overlooking the challenges associated with out-of-sight\nobjects and the inherent noise in sensor data caused by limited camera\ncoverage, obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised\ntrajectories. These limitations pose safety risks and hinder reliable\nprediction in real-world scenarios. In this extended work, we present\nadvancements in Out-of-Sight Trajectory (OST), a novel task that predicts the\nnoise-free visual trajectories of out-of-sight objects using noisy sensor data.\nBuilding on our previous research, we broaden the scope of Out-of-Sight\nTrajectory Prediction (OOSTraj) to include pedestrians and vehicles, extending\nits applicability to autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and virtual\nreality. Our enhanced Vision-Positioning Denoising Module leverages camera\ncalibration to establish a vision-positioning mapping, addressing the lack of\nvisual references, while effectively denoising noisy sensor data in an\nunsupervised manner. Through extensive evaluations on the Vi-Fi and JRDB\ndatasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both trajectory\ndenoising and prediction, significantly surpassing previous baselines.\nAdditionally, we introduce comparisons with traditional denoising methods, such\nas Kalman filtering, and adapt recent trajectory prediction models to our task,\nproviding a comprehensive benchmark. This work represents the first initiative\nto integrate vision-positioning projection for denoising noisy sensor\ntrajectories of out-of-sight agents, paving the way for future advances.
