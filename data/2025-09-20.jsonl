Specifically, we prove that three distinct energy\nformulations--kinetic, conditional kinetic, and geodesic energy--are\nmathematically equivalent under the structure of MDMs, and that MDMs minimize\nall three when the mask schedule satisfies a closed-form optimality condition.\nThis unification not only clarifies the theoretical foundations of MDMs, but\nalso motivates practical improvements in sampling. By parameterizing\ninterpolation schedules via Beta distributions, we reduce the schedule design\nspace to a tractable 2D search, enabling efficient post-training tuning without\nmodel modification. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks\ndemonstrate that our energy-inspired schedules outperform hand-crafted\nbaselines, particularly in low-step sampling settings."}
