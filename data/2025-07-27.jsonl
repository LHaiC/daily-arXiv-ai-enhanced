First, an encoder\nblock converts the operands from a two's complement to a sign magnitude\nrepresentation, followed by a multiplier module which performs the compute\noperation and outputs the resulting value in the original format. This allows\nto leverage the power-efficiency of the Sign Magnitude encoding for the\nmultiplication. To ensure the computing format is not altered, those two\ncomponents are synthesized and optimized separately. Our method leads to\nsignificant power savings for input values centered around zero, as commonly\nencountered in AI workloads. Under a realistic input stream with values\nnormally distributed with a standard deviation of 3.0, post-synthesis\nsimulations of the 4-bit multiplier design show up to 12.9% lower switching\nactivity compared to synthesis without decomposition. Those gains are achieved\nwhile ensuring compliance into any production-ready system as the overall\ncircuit stays logic-equivalent.

Specifically, TO estimation is essential for\nlocating users' pilots on the delay-time plane, while CFO estimation enhances\nchannel estimation accuracy. First, we propose a TO estimation technique for an\nexisting multiuser pilot structure in MU-OTFS. We replace the impulse pilot\n(IMP) in this pilot structure with a more practical pilot with a cyclic prefix\n(PCP), referred to as single-user-inspired PCP (SU-PCP). This structure employs\ndifferent Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences, which enables pilot separation via\ncorrelation at the receiver side. Consequently, we introduce a\ncorrelation-based TO estimation technique for uplink MU-OTFS using this pilot\nstructure. Next, a spectrally efficient and practical pilot pattern is\nproposed, where each user transmits a PCP within a shared pilot region on the\ndelay-Doppler plane, referred to as MU-PCP. At the receiver, the second TO\nestimation technique utilizes a bank of filters to separate different users'\nsignals and accurately estimate their TOs. Then, we derive a mathematical\nthreshold range to enhance TO estimation accuracy by finding the first major\npeak in the correlation function rather than relying solely on the highest\npeak. After locating the received users' pilot signals using one of the\nproposed TO estimation techniques, our proposed CFO estimation technique\nreduces the multi-dimensional maximum likelihood (ML) search problem into\nmultiple one-dimensional search problems. In this technique, we apply the\nChebyshev polynomials of the first kind basis expansion model (CPF-BEM) to\neffectively handle the time-variations of the channel in obtaining the CFO\nestimates for all the users."}

Specifically, we propose a generative adversarial\nnetwork that leverages causality-invariant learning to extract causal and\nnon-causal representations from the data. Causal representations are invariant\nand encompass crucial information to identify the data's label. They can\nencapsulate semantic knowledge and facilitate effective data reconstruction at\nthe receiver. Moreover, the causal mechanism ensures that learned\nrepresentations remain consistent across different domains, making the system\nreliable even with users collecting data from diverse domains. As\nuser-collected data evolves over time causing knowledge divergence among users,\nwe design sparse update protocols to improve the invariant properties of the\nknowledge while minimizing communication overheads. Three key observations were\ndrawn from our empirical evaluations. Firstly, causality-invariant knowledge\nensures consistency across different devices despite the diverse training data.\nSecondly, invariant knowledge has promising performance in classification\ntasks, which is pivotal for goal-oriented semantic communications. Thirdly, our\nknowledge-based data reconstruction highlights the robustness of our decoder,\nwhich surpasses other state-of-the-art data reconstruction and semantic\ncompression methods in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)."}

Those gains are achieved\nwhile ensuring compliance into any production-ready system as the overall\ncircuit stays logic-equivalent. With the compliance lifted and a slightly\nsmaller input range of -7 to +7, switching activity reductions can reach up to\n33%.

This\nsensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.\nPrior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its\nseverity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs\nalso exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the\nLLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To\naddress both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple\ntimes with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority\nvoting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases\ncomputational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the\ndirection -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --\nand magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within\na single dataset.

To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method\nthat adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each\ninstance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two\ntasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a\ndynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of\n81%, while preserving the accuracy.

We\npresent a fully first-principles framework for computing the spin relaxation\ntensor in a single-molecule magnet, \\ce{VOPc(OH)8}, by combining density\nfunctional theory with a mode-resolved open-system formalism. By expanding the\nspin Hamiltonian in vibrational normal modes and evaluating both linear and\nquadratic spin-phonon coupling tensors via finite differences of the\n$g$-tensor, we construct a relaxation tensor that enters a Lindblad-type\nquantum master equation. Our formalism captures both direct (one-phonon) and\nresonant-Raman (two-phonon) relaxation processes.

A\nkey innovation of ICWLM is its utilization of in-context learning (ICL),\nenabling the model to adapt to varying system configurations and channel\nconditions with minimal demonstration pairs, eliminating the need for extensive\nretraining.

We evaluate the system on publicly\navailable datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging.\nFor example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured\ndata (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by\nthe Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring\nprivacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize\nit. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based\napproach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage\nMedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name.\nThese features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the\nbest-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent\nand Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on\ndata type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent\" runs\nthe selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs\nusing tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps. By automating these\nhigh-friction stages of the ML lifecycle, the proposed framework reduces the\nneed for repeated expert intervention, offering a scalable, cost-efficient\npathway for operationalizing AI in clinical environments."}

In practice, however, a\nreactor's operational flexibility is closely tied to it's fuel cycle stage and\nthe associated reactivity margin. A key physical constraint to power\nmaneuverability is xenon poisoning, caused by an increase in neutron absorbing\nxenon concentration following a power ramp down. This can delay or even prevent\nsubsequent power ramp up due to suppressed core reactivity. Additionally, if a\nreactor is shutdown during periods of low reactivity, restart times can vary\nsignificantly due to these xenon transients, leading to longer downtimes. This\nwork introduces a physics informed, metaheuristic modeling approach that embeds\nfuel cycle dynamics directly with a unit commitment (UC) framework. The\nframework tracks reactivity margin, dynamically activates xenon related\nconstraints, and endogenously implements refueling outages based on the core\nconditions. By capturing intra-cycle reactivity evolution and the conditional\nonset of xenon poisoning, the formulation allows for operation dependent\nnuclear dispatch that reflects both regulatory limits and physical behavior.\nWhen applied to a representative reactor fleet operating in distinct modes of\noperation -- ranging from baseload to part load -- the framework reveals that\nflexible operation can slow reactivity degradation and extend fuel cycles.

We introduce a QKD protocol that\nsurpasses the optimal Gaussian modulated CV-QKD (GG02) protocol by utilising\nprobabilistic filters without known physical representation. Our approach\nemploys a Gaussian filter at Alice's station and a non-Gaussian notch-like\nfilter at Bob's station. Alice's filter optimises modulation variance to\nachieve key rates near the optimal GG02 performance, while Bob's filter adapts\nthe effective channel conditions, which can result in higher key rates than the\noptimal GG02 protocol. Our security analysis avoids Gaussian extremality,\naccurately bounding Eve's information. The protocol dynamically optimises the\nsecret-key rate for rapidly changing channels, such as terrestrial links and\nsatellite-to-ground communications, and can extract keys in regions deemed\nnon-secure by parameter estimation. Implemented at software level, our protocol\nrequires no hardware modifications and can be integrated into existing QKD\nsystems.

Despite\ntheir promise, AI applications in HIV care remain underexplored, and LLM\nbenchmarking studies are scarce. This study evaluates the current capabilities\nof LLMs in HIV management, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We\nintroduce HIVMedQA, a benchmark designed to assess open-ended medical question\nanswering in HIV care. The dataset consists of curated, clinically relevant\nquestions developed with input from an infectious disease physician. We\nevaluated seven general-purpose and three medically specialized LLMs, applying\nprompt engineering to enhance performance. Our evaluation framework\nincorporates both lexical similarity and an LLM-as-a-judge approach, extended\nto better reflect clinical relevance. We assessed performance across key\ndimensions: question comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall, bias,\npotential harm, and factual accuracy. Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro\nconsistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of\nthe top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question\ncomplexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform\ngeneral-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of\nperformance. Reasoning and comprehension were more challenging than factual\nrecall, and cognitive biases such as recency and status quo were observed.\nThese findings underscore the need for targeted development and evaluation to\nensure safe, effective LLM integration in clinical care."}

We have prototyped a simulator based\non the RMA and applied it to the actual factory layout design problem.

On the other hand, datasets of synthetically-generated prompts\nachieve scale, but typically lack the realistic nuances and creative\nadversarial strategies found in human-crafted prompts. To combine the strengths\nof both human and machine approaches, we propose Seed2Harvest, a hybrid\nred-teaming method for guided expansion of culturally diverse, human-crafted\nadversarial prompt seeds. The resulting prompts preserve the characteristics\nand attack patterns of human prompts while maintaining comparable average\nattack success rates (0.31 NudeNet, 0.36 SD NSFW, 0.12 Q16). Our expanded\ndataset achieves substantially higher diversity with 535 unique geographic\nlocations and a Shannon entropy of 7.48, compared to 58 locations and 5.28\nentropy in the original dataset. Our work demonstrates the importance of\nhuman-machine collaboration in leveraging human creativity and machine\ncomputational capacity to achieve comprehensive, scalable red-teaming for\ncontinuous T2I model safety evaluation."}

This\nsensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.\nPrior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its\nseverity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs\nalso exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the\nLLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To\naddress both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple\ntimes with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority\nvoting.

Extending prior findings, we observe that both the\ndirection -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --\nand magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within\na single dataset.

In this work, we (a) introduce a supervised deep learning\nframework based on neural operators for solving PDEs and providing arbitrary\nresolution solutions, and (b) propose downscaling models with an application to\nCopernicus ocean current data. Additionally, our method can model surrogate\nPDEs and predict solutions at arbitrary resolution, regardless of the input\nresolution. We evaluated our model on real-world Copernicus ocean current data\nand synthetic Navier-Stokes simulation datasets."}

In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector\nagainst LRMs, which we term \"overthinking backdoors\".

Despite challenges related to computational efficiency\nand generalization capabilities, diffusion models are expected to play an\nincreasingly important role in smart and precision agriculture as technology\nadvances, providing substantial support for the sustainable development of\nglobal agriculture."}

Although numerous physically based and machine\nlearning models exist, achieving high accuracy, interpretability, and\ncomputational efficiency under data-scarce conditions remains a major\nchallenge. We address this challenge with a novel method, HYdrological\nPrediction with multi-model Ensemble and Reservoir computing (HYPER) that\nleverages multi-model ensemble and reservoir computing (RC).

For ungauged basins, we infer the\nrequired BMA and RC weights by linking them to catchment attributes from gauged\nbasins, creating a generalizable framework. We evaluated HYPER using data from\n87 river basins in Japan. In a data-rich scenario, HYPER (median Kling-Gupta\nEfficiency, KGE, of 0.56) performed comparably to a benchmark LSTM (KGE 0.55)\nbut required only 5% of its computational time.

These applications have diverse token-generation latency\nrequirements. As a result, simply classifying workloads as latency-sensitive\n(LS) or best-effort (BE) overlooks the nuances within the latency-sensitive\ncategory and results in suboptimal user experiences and scheduling\nopportunities. However, efficiently serving requests with multiple SLO\nrequirements poses significant challenges. First, all requests within a batch\ngenerate new tokens simultaneously, which can misalign them with their distinct\nSLO requirements. Moreover, while existing systems focus on auto-scaling for\nhandling various overall request rates, the diversity of SLOs necessitates\nfine-grained auto-scaling among these SLO tiers. Finally, unlike LS/BE\nscenarios, where BE requests can be aborted at any time to ensure the SLO\nattainment of LS requests, those with different latency-sensitive SLOs cannot\ntolerate prolonged delays, and tail latency must be controlled.\n  To tackle these challenges, we propose PolyServe, a novel multi-SLO\nscheduling policy at scale that maintains high SLO attainment while maximizing\nthroughput. PolyServe first groups requests into multiple bins based on their\nper-token latency requirement, then schedules each bin to a subset of the\nserver fleet. PolyServe routes requests to the highest-load but still\nSLO-attainable server to create a load gradient that facilitates auto-scaling.\nTo increase utilization, PolyServe permits looser-SLO requests to share\ntighter-SLO instances when their own servers are saturated. PolyServe uses\nprofiling data to guide scheduling decisions and manage tail latency through\nrequest-wait-time-aware scheduling, dynamic chunking, and continuous chunked\nprefill prediction. PolyServe achieves 1.23x goodput gain compared to existing\npolicies, achieving up to 92.5% of optimal goodput."}

Instead of relying on\ntext descriptions, we explore solutions leveraging image data, which provides\ndiverse and more fine-grained style cues. In this work, we propose SIDA, a\nnovel and efficient zero-shot domain adaptation method leveraging synthetic\nimages. To generate synthetic images, we first create detailed, source-like\nimages and apply image translation to reflect the style of the target domain.\nWe then utilize the style features of these synthetic images as a proxy for the\ntarget domain. Based on these features, we introduce Domain Mix and Patch Style\nTransfer modules, which enable effective modeling of real-world variations. In\nparticular, Domain Mix blends multiple styles to expand the intra-domain\nrepresentations, and Patch Style Transfer assigns different styles to\nindividual patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by showing\nstate-of-the-art performance in diverse zero-shot adaptation scenarios,\nparticularly in challenging domains. Moreover, our approach achieves high\nefficiency by significantly reducing the overall adaptation time."}
