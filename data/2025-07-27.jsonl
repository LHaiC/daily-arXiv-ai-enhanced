First, an encoder\nblock converts the operands from a two's complement to a sign magnitude\nrepresentation, followed by a multiplier module which performs the compute\noperation and outputs the resulting value in the original format. This allows\nto leverage the power-efficiency of the Sign Magnitude encoding for the\nmultiplication. To ensure the computing format is not altered, those two\ncomponents are synthesized and optimized separately. Our method leads to\nsignificant power savings for input values centered around zero, as commonly\nencountered in AI workloads. Under a realistic input stream with values\nnormally distributed with a standard deviation of 3.0, post-synthesis\nsimulations of the 4-bit multiplier design show up to 12.9% lower switching\nactivity compared to synthesis without decomposition.

Specifically, TO estimation is essential for\nlocating users' pilots on the delay-time plane, while CFO estimation enhances\nchannel estimation accuracy. First, we propose a TO estimation technique for an\nexisting multiuser pilot structure in MU-OTFS. We replace the impulse pilot\n(IMP) in this pilot structure with a more practical pilot with a cyclic prefix\n(PCP), referred to as single-user-inspired PCP (SU-PCP). This structure employs\ndifferent Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences, which enables pilot separation via\ncorrelation at the receiver side. Consequently, we introduce a\ncorrelation-based TO estimation technique for uplink MU-OTFS using this pilot\nstructure. Next, a spectrally efficient and practical pilot pattern is\nproposed, where each user transmits a PCP within a shared pilot region on the\ndelay-Doppler plane, referred to as MU-PCP. At the receiver, the second TO\nestimation technique utilizes a bank of filters to separate different users'\nsignals and accurately estimate their TOs. Then, we derive a mathematical\nthreshold range to enhance TO estimation accuracy by finding the first major\npeak in the correlation function rather than relying solely on the highest\npeak. After locating the received users' pilot signals using one of the\nproposed TO estimation techniques, our proposed CFO estimation technique\nreduces the multi-dimensional maximum likelihood (ML) search problem into\nmultiple one-dimensional search problems. In this technique, we apply the\nChebyshev polynomials of the first kind basis expansion model (CPF-BEM) to\neffectively handle the time-variations of the channel in obtaining the CFO\nestimates for all the users."}

Specifically, we propose a generative adversarial\nnetwork that leverages causality-invariant learning to extract causal and\nnon-causal representations from the data. Causal representations are invariant\nand encompass crucial information to identify the data's label. They can\nencapsulate semantic knowledge and facilitate effective data reconstruction at\nthe receiver. Moreover, the causal mechanism ensures that learned\nrepresentations remain consistent across different domains, making the system\nreliable even with users collecting data from diverse domains. As\nuser-collected data evolves over time causing knowledge divergence among users,\nwe design sparse update protocols to improve the invariant properties of the\nknowledge while minimizing communication overheads. Three key observations were\ndrawn from our empirical evaluations. Firstly, causality-invariant knowledge\nensures consistency across different devices despite the diverse training data.\nSecondly, invariant knowledge has promising performance in classification\ntasks, which is pivotal for goal-oriented semantic communications. Thirdly, our\nknowledge-based data reconstruction highlights the robustness of our decoder,\nwhich surpasses other state-of-the-art data reconstruction and semantic\ncompression methods in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)."}

Those gains are achieved\nwhile ensuring compliance into any production-ready system as the overall\ncircuit stays logic-equivalent. With the compliance lifted and a slightly\nsmaller input range of -7 to +7, switching activity reductions can reach up to\n33%.

This\nsensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.\nPrior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its\nseverity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs\nalso exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the\nLLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To\naddress both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple\ntimes with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority\nvoting.

Extending prior findings, we observe that both the\ndirection -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --\nand magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within\na single dataset.

To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method\nthat adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each\ninstance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two\ntasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a\ndynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of\n81%, while preserving the accuracy.

We\npresent a fully first-principles framework for computing the spin relaxation\ntensor in a single-molecule magnet, \\ce{VOPc(OH)8}, by combining density\nfunctional theory with a mode-resolved open-system formalism. By expanding the\nspin Hamiltonian in vibrational normal modes and evaluating both linear and\nquadratic spin-phonon coupling tensors via finite differences of the\n$g$-tensor, we construct a relaxation tensor that enters a Lindblad-type\nquantum master equation. Our formalism captures both direct (one-phonon) and\nresonant-Raman (two-phonon) relaxation processes.

A\nkey innovation of ICWLM is its utilization of in-context learning (ICL),\nenabling the model to adapt to varying system configurations and channel\nconditions with minimal demonstration pairs, eliminating the need for extensive\nretraining.

In practice, however, a\nreactor's operational flexibility is closely tied to it's fuel cycle stage and\nthe associated reactivity margin. A key physical constraint to power\nmaneuverability is xenon poisoning, caused by an increase in neutron absorbing\nxenon concentration following a power ramp down. This can delay or even prevent\nsubsequent power ramp up due to suppressed core reactivity. Additionally, if a\nreactor is shutdown during periods of low reactivity, restart times can vary\nsignificantly due to these xenon transients, leading to longer downtimes. This\nwork introduces a physics informed, metaheuristic modeling approach that embeds\nfuel cycle dynamics directly with a unit commitment (UC) framework. The\nframework tracks reactivity margin, dynamically activates xenon related\nconstraints, and endogenously implements refueling outages based on the core\nconditions. By capturing intra-cycle reactivity evolution and the conditional\nonset of xenon poisoning, the formulation allows for operation dependent\nnuclear dispatch that reflects both regulatory limits and physical behavior.\nWhen applied to a representative reactor fleet operating in distinct modes of\noperation -- ranging from baseload to part load -- the framework reveals that\nflexible operation can slow reactivity degradation and extend fuel cycles.

The second one is Weiss's mean-field\napproximation, which provides a reasonable description of $M(T)$ near $T_c$.\nUsing a single tuning parameter, we combine these two approaches to describe\n$M(T)$ for any $0<T<T_c$. The theoretical result for $M(T)$ aligns well with\nour measurements and the previously available experimental data across the\nentire temperature range. We also demonstrate that experimental and theoretical\ndependences $M(T)$ follow the mean-field prediction $\\sqrt{T_c - T }$ for\nalmost all temperatures."}

The protocol dynamically optimises the\nsecret-key rate for rapidly changing channels, such as terrestrial links and\nsatellite-to-ground communications, and can extract keys in regions deemed\nnon-secure by parameter estimation.

Continuous access to new and challenging adversarial prompts\nacross diverse domains is essential for stress-testing these models for\nresilience against novel attacks from multiple vectors. Current techniques for\ngenerating such prompts are either entirely authored by humans or synthetically\ngenerated. On the one hand, datasets of human-crafted adversarial prompts are\noften too small in size and imbalanced in their cultural and contextual\nrepresentation. On the other hand, datasets of synthetically-generated prompts\nachieve scale, but typically lack the realistic nuances and creative\nadversarial strategies found in human-crafted prompts. To combine the strengths\nof both human and machine approaches, we propose Seed2Harvest, a hybrid\nred-teaming method for guided expansion of culturally diverse, human-crafted\nadversarial prompt seeds. The resulting prompts preserve the characteristics\nand attack patterns of human prompts while maintaining comparable average\nattack success rates (0.31 NudeNet, 0.36 SD NSFW, 0.12 Q16).

This\nsensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.\nPrior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its\nseverity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs\nalso exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the\nLLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To\naddress both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple\ntimes with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority\nvoting.

Extending prior findings, we observe that both the\ndirection -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --\nand magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within\na single dataset.

In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector\nagainst LRMs, which we term \"overthinking backdoors\".

We have identified 94 relevant\narticles out of 1,398 collected ones. A great deal of attention has been given\nto the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main\npurpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing,\ncorpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer\narchitectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text,\nespecially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of\nevaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where\nutility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic\nmedical text. Although the generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a\nmoderate possibility to act as real medical documents in different downstream\nNLP tasks, it has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the\nreal documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming\nsparsity/undersampling issues. Yet, privacy is still a major issue behind\ngenerating synthetic medical text, where more human assessments are needed to\ncheck for the existence of any sensitive information. Despite that, advances in\ngenerating synthetic medical text will considerably accelerate the adoption of\nworkflows and pipeline development, discarding the time-consuming legalities of\ndata transfer."}

However, efficiently serving requests with multiple SLO\nrequirements poses significant challenges. First, all requests within a batch\ngenerate new tokens simultaneously, which can misalign them with their distinct\nSLO requirements. Moreover, while existing systems focus on auto-scaling for\nhandling various overall request rates, the diversity of SLOs necessitates\nfine-grained auto-scaling among these SLO tiers. Finally, unlike LS/BE\nscenarios, where BE requests can be aborted at any time to ensure the SLO\nattainment of LS requests, those with different latency-sensitive SLOs cannot\ntolerate prolonged delays, and tail latency must be controlled.\n  To tackle these challenges, we propose PolyServe, a novel multi-SLO\nscheduling policy at scale that maintains high SLO attainment while maximizing\nthroughput. PolyServe first groups requests into multiple bins based on their\nper-token latency requirement, then schedules each bin to a subset of the\nserver fleet.

We\nthen apply a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer that selects the best\nimage by verifying its ability to retrieve the original caption via\nimage-to-text retrieval. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SynC\nconsistently and significantly improves performance across various ZIC models\non standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps), achieving state-of-the-art\nresults in several scenarios. SynC offers an effective strategy for curating\nrefined synthetic data to enhance ZIC."}

Following\nheuristic-based \"Think step by step\" approaches, the field has evolved in two\nmain directions: while one group of methods uses textual feedback to elicit\nimproved prompts from general-purpose LLMs in a training-free way, a concurrent\nline of research relies on numerical rewards to train a special prompt model,\ntailored for providing optimal prompts to the target model. In this paper, we\nintroduce the Textual Reward Prompt framework (TRPrompt), which unifies these\napproaches by directly incorporating textual feedback into training of the\nprompt model. Our framework does not require prior dataset collection and is\nbeing iteratively improved with the feedback on the generated prompts. When\ncoupled with the capacity of an LLM to internalize the notion of what a \"good\"\nprompt is, the high-resolution signal provided by the textual rewards allows us\nto train a prompt model yielding state-of-the-art query-specific prompts for\nthe problems from the challenging math datasets GSMHard and MATH."}

To enable adaptation without\ntarget images, existing studies utilize CLIP's embedding space and text\ndescription to simulate target-like style features. Despite the previous\nachievements in zero-shot domain adaptation, we observe that these text-driven\nmethods struggle to capture complex real-world variations and significantly\nincrease adaptation time due to their alignment process. Instead of relying on\ntext descriptions, we explore solutions leveraging image data, which provides\ndiverse and more fine-grained style cues. In this work, we propose SIDA, a\nnovel and efficient zero-shot domain adaptation method leveraging synthetic\nimages. To generate synthetic images, we first create detailed, source-like\nimages and apply image translation to reflect the style of the target domain.\nWe then utilize the style features of these synthetic images as a proxy for the\ntarget domain. Based on these features, we introduce Domain Mix and Patch Style\nTransfer modules, which enable effective modeling of real-world variations. In\nparticular, Domain Mix blends multiple styles to expand the intra-domain\nrepresentations, and Patch Style Transfer assigns different styles to\nindividual patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by showing\nstate-of-the-art performance in diverse zero-shot adaptation scenarios,\nparticularly in challenging domains. Moreover, our approach achieves high\nefficiency by significantly reducing the overall adaptation time."}
