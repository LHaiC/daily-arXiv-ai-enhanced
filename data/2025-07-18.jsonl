However, recent studies have called into question the\nability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,\n2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that\ndiscriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal\ndifference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have\naccess to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously\nreported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a\nconsistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,\nlayers, and parameter count).

This improves upon the $(\\frac{1}{2} +\n\\varepsilon_0)$-approximation of Feige and Langberg (2001) for $\\maxcut_k$ (the\nspecial case when $c=1, k_1 = k$), and generalizes the $(0.858 -\n\\varepsilon)$-approximation of Raghavendra and Tan (2012), which only applies\nwhen $\\min\\{k,n-k\\}=\\Omega(n)$ and does not handle multiple constraints.\n  We also establish that, for general values of $c$, it is NP-hard to determine\nwhether a feasible solution exists that cuts all edges. Finally, we present a\n$1/2$-approximation algorithm for Max-Cut under an arbitrary matroid\nconstraint."}

One\nof them is concept drift, which is characterized by the change in data\ndistribution over time. Among many approaches explored in literature, the\nfusion of classifiers has been showing good results and is getting growing\nattention. DS methods, due to the ensemble being instance-based, seem to be an\nefficient choice under drifting scenarios. However, some attention must be paid\nto adapting such methods for concept drift. The training must be done in order\nto create local experts, and the commonly used neighborhood-search DS may\nbecome prohibitive with the continuous arrival of data.

Using scalable patterning of 2D monolayers into periodic\nnano-bubbles and nano-wrinkles, we construct materials with structural\nanalogies to macroscopic bubble wrap but engineered at length scales much\nshorter than the mean free path of air and the mean free path of phonons in the\natomically thin monolayers.

This study presents the\nfirst comprehensive review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows,\nencompassing both conventional supervised methods and emerging transfer\nlearning approaches. To identify the optimal supervised crop mapping workflows,\nwe conducted systematic experiments, comparing six widely adopted satellite\nimage-based preprocessing methods, alongside eleven supervised pixel-wise\nclassification models. Additionally, we assessed the synergistic impact of\nvaried training sample sizes and variable combinations. Moreover, we identified\noptimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift.\nThe evaluation of best methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural\nsites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from\nCDL trusted pixels and field surveys.\n  Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval\npreprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal\nperformance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid\ntraining and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and\ndirect transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques\nenhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop\nclasses while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally,\nworkflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a\nsufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate\nand generalizable results. Below a certain threshold, transfer learning that\nmatches the level of domain shift is a viable alternative to achieve crop\nmapping.

An appealing algorithm suggested by\nCharikar et al. is to sample a random spanning tree and remove k-1 edges,\nproducing a random forest. If the components of the forest form a balanced\npartition, the partition is equitable under an easily computed acceptance\nprobability. Cannon et al. recently showed that spanning trees on grid graphs\nand grid-like graphs on $n$ vertices are splittable into $k$ equal sized pieces\nwith probability at least $n^{-2k}$, leading to the first rigorous sampling\nalgorithm for a class of graphs. We present complementary results showing that\nspanning trees on dense random graphs also have inverse polynomial probability\nof being splittable, giving another class of graphs where equitable partitions\ncan be efficiently sampled exactly. These proofs also guarantee fast\nalmost-uniform sampling for the up-down walk on forests, giving another\nprovably efficient randomized method for generating equitable partitions.\n  Further, we show that problems with the well-studied ReCom algorithm for\nequitable partitioning are more extensive than previously known, even in\nspecial cases that were believed to be more promising.

This article extends a multiport\nS-parameters-based model for predicting the scattering properties of\nmultifrequency operating structures. The model extends the applicability of\nconvenient S-matrix models to time-modulated multiport structures. Unlike known\napproaches, this model incorporates structural scattering, mutual coupling, the\npossibility of non-digital modulation, and non-periodic configurations,\nenabling precise analysis and optimization for a broad range of communication\nand sensing systems. Validation against experimental results for a space-time\nmodulated scattering structure demonstrates the accuracy and practical\napplicability of the proposed model."}

Unlike\nstandard submodular maximization, which only requires selecting elements for\nthe solution, $k$-submodular maximization adds the challenge of determining the\nsubset to which each selected element belongs. Prior research has shown that\nthe greedy algorithm is a 1/2-approximation for the monotone $k$-submodular\nmaximization problem under cardinality or matroid constraints. However, whether\na firm 1/2-approximation exists for the budgeted version (i.e., with a knapsack\nconstraint) has remained open for several years. We resolve this question\naffirmatively by proving that the 1-Guess Greedy algorithm, which first guesses\nan appropriate element from an optimal solution before proceeding with the\ngreedy algorithm, achieves a 1/2-approximation. This result is asymptotically\ntight as $((k+1)/(2k)+\\epsilon)$-approximation requires exponentially many\nvalue oracle queries even without constraints (Iwata et al., SODA 2016). We\nfurther show that 1-Guess Greedy is 1/3-approximation for the non-monotone\nproblem. This algorithm is both simple and parallelizable, making it\nwell-suited for practical applications. Using the thresholding technique from\n(Badanidiyuru and Vondrak, SODA 2014), it runs in nearly $\\tilde O(n^2k^2)$\ntime.\n  The proof idea is simple: we introduce a novel continuous transformation from\nan optimal solution to a greedy solution, using the multilinear extension to\nevaluate every fractional solution during the transformation. This continuous\nanalysis approach yields two key extensions. First, it enables improved\napproximation ratios of various existing algorithms. Second, our method\nnaturally extends to $k$-submodular maximization problems under broader\nconstraints, offering a more flexible and unified analysis framework."}

As the scales of graph databases have increased tremendously\nin recent years, large-scale graphs G are often disk-resident. Obtaining the\nBFS results of G in semi-external memory model is inevitable, because the\nin-memory BFS algorithm has to maintain the entire G in the main memory, and\nexternal BFS algorithms consume high computational costs. As a good trade-off\nbetween the internal and external memory models, semi-external memory model\nassumes that the main memory can at least reside a spanning tree of G.\nNevertheless, the semi-external BFS problem is still an open issue due to its\ndifficulty. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive study for processing\nBFS in semi-external memory model. After discussing the naive solutions based\non the basic framework of semi-external graph algorithms, this paper presents\nan efficient algorithm, named EP-BFS, with a small minimum memory space\nrequirement, which is an important factor for evaluating semi-external\nalgorithms.

This paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied\nQuestion Answering (LA-EQA), a new task in which a robot must both recall past\nexperiences and actively explore its environment to answer complex,\ntemporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically\nfocus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a\nsingle past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past,\npresent, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult\nits memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer.\nStandard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to\nlimited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to\ncombine memory recall with active exploration. To address this, we propose a\nstructured memory system for robots, inspired by the mind palace method from\ncognitive science. Our method encodes episodic experiences as scene-graph-based\nworld instances, forming a reasoning and planning algorithm that enables\ntargeted memory retrieval and guided navigation.

Despite great progress, current experimental implementations\nof $2+1$D lattice gauge theories are mostly restricted to relatively small\nsystem sizes and two-level representations of the gauge and electric fields.\nHere, we propose a resource-efficient method for quantum simulating $2+1$D\nspin-$S$ $\\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link lattice gauge theories with dynamical\nmatter using qudit-based quantum processors. By integrating out the matter\nfields through Gauss's law, we reformulate the quantum link model in a purely\nspin picture compatible with qudit encoding across arbitrary spatial\ndimensions, eliminating the need for ancillary qubits and reducing resource\noverhead. Focusing first on the spin-$1/2$ case, we construct explicit circuits\nfor the full Hamiltonian and demonstrate through numerical simulations that the\nfirst-order Trotterized circuits accurately capture the quench dynamics even in\nthe presence of realistic noise levels. Additionally, we introduce a general\nmethod for constructing coupling-term circuits for higher-spin representations\n$S>1/2$.

However, these gains often persist\neven when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted\nrewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true\nreasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific\npatterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective\nand identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,\n\\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test\nproblems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \\emph{evaluation\nfragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are\nhighly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning\nconsistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic\nevaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting\nfixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve\nmultiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across\nstructurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and\nimproving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular\nbenchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and\nVAR-AIME24.

A main reason for this success is the ability of\nLLMs to perform in-context learning, which, however, strongly relies on the\ndesign of task examples, closely related to the target tasks. Consequently,\nemploying LLMs to formulate optimal control problems often requires task\nexamples that contain explicit mathematical expressions, designed by trained\nengineers. Furthermore, there is often no principled way to evaluate for\nhallucination before task execution. To address these challenges, we propose\nDEMONSTRATE, a novel methodology that avoids the use of LLMs for complex\noptimization problem generations, and instead only relies on the embedding\nrepresentations of task descriptions. To do this, we leverage tools from\ninverse optimal control to replace in-context prompt examples with task\ndemonstrations, as well as the concept of multitask learning, which ensures\ntarget and example task similarity by construction. Given the fact that\nhardware demonstrations can easily be collected using teleoperation or guidance\nof the robot, our approach significantly reduces the reliance on engineering\nexpertise for designing in-context examples.

An alternative approach, is\nto have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a\nlarge and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and\ncostly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators\nand having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is\nthe use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can\nfreely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.\nThe results are then elaborated into a model ranking.

The complexity arises from the interplay of two\nsimultaneous points of contact: one between the robot and the tool, and another\nbetween the tool and the environment. Tactile and proximity sensors play a\ncrucial role in identifying these complex contacts. However, learning tool\nmanipulation using these sensors remains challenging due to limited real-world\ndata and the large sim-to-real gap. To address this, we propose a few-shot\ntool-use skill transfer framework using multimodal sensing. The framework\ninvolves pre-training the base policy to capture contact states common in\ntool-use skills in simulation and fine-tuning it with human demonstrations\ncollected in the real-world target domain to bridge the domain gap. We validate\nthat this framework enables teaching surface-following tasks using tools with\ndiverse physical and geometric properties with a small number of demonstrations\non the Franka Emika robot arm.

In order to reliably accomplish these\ntasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,\nwhether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely\nnonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the\nability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,\n2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that\ndiscriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal\ndifference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have\naccess to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously\nreported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a\nconsistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,\nlayers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors\nidentified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human\ncategorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human\nparticipants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by\ncorrelating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'\nratings of interpretable features.

We\nthen explore how these components are architecturally integrated to create\nsophisticated system implementations: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),\nmemory systems and tool-integrated reasoning, and multi-agent systems. Through\nthis systematic analysis of over 1300 research papers, our survey not only\nestablishes a technical roadmap for the field but also reveals a critical\nresearch gap: a fundamental asymmetry exists between model capabilities. While\ncurrent models, augmented by advanced context engineering, demonstrate\nremarkable proficiency in understanding complex contexts, they exhibit\npronounced limitations in generating equally sophisticated, long-form outputs.\nAddressing this gap is a defining priority for future research. Ultimately,\nthis survey provides a unified framework for both researchers and engineers\nadvancing context-aware AI."}

However, in many papers neural\nnetworks are frequently tested by training and testing on one example channel\nor similar channels. This is because data-driven methods often degrade on new\ndata which they are not trained on, as they cannot extrapolate their training\nknowledge. This is despite the fact physical channels are often assumed to be\ntime-variant. However, due to the low latency requirements and limited\ncomputing resources, neural networks may not have enough time and computing\nresources to execute online training to fine-tune the parameters. This\nmotivates us to design offline-trained neural networks that can perform\nrobustly over wireless channels, but without any actual channel information\nbeing known at design time. In this paper, we propose design criteria to\ngenerate synthetic training datasets for neural networks, which guarantee that\nafter training the resulting networks achieve a certain mean squared error\n(MSE) on new and previously unseen channels. Therefore, neural network\nsolutions require no prior channel information or parameters update for\nreal-world implementations.

Traditional\nflow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions\n(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like\ncross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating\ntime and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent\nimages as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action\nwhile eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative\nmodeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different\nmodalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data\nlacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional\nvisual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a\nstructured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,\nup-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we\nsupervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs\nthrough flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss\nthrough sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end\nlearning.

Furthermore, we\nintroduce a representative token, which represents the most representative\ntoken per window by computing similarity at a specific timestep and selecting\nthe token with the highest average similarity. This approach preserves the most\nsalient local features while minimizing computational overhead. Experimental\nresults show that ReToM achieves a 6.2% improvement in FID and higher CLIP\nscores compared to the baseline, while maintaining comparable inference time.\nWe empirically demonstrate that ReToM is effective in balancing visual quality\nand computational efficiency."}

Some textureless planes or repetitive patterns are prone\nto omission and manifest as voids within the reconstructed 3D point clouds.\nBesides, objects with complex structures tend to introduce distortion of\ndetails caused by misalignments between the captured images and the dense\nreconstructed point clouds. 2D multi-view images present visual consistency\nwith 3D point clouds and provide more detailed representations of scene\ncomponents, which can naturally compensate for these deficiencies.

A key difficulty in SR is estimating the unobservable feature, which\nencapsulates significant spectral information not captured by RGB imaging\nsensors. The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial\njoint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable\nfeature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding\nRGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB\npre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this\nend, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an\nunobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding\nspatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can\nfocus on modeling spectral structure.

This paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied\nQuestion Answering (LA-EQA), a new task in which a robot must both recall past\nexperiences and actively explore its environment to answer complex,\ntemporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically\nfocus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a\nsingle past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past,\npresent, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult\nits memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer.\nStandard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to\nlimited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to\ncombine memory recall with active exploration. To address this, we propose a\nstructured memory system for robots, inspired by the mind palace method from\ncognitive science. Our method encodes episodic experiences as scene-graph-based\nworld instances, forming a reasoning and planning algorithm that enables\ntargeted memory retrieval and guided navigation.

Despite advances in\nmulti-sensor fusion, a critical gap remains in developing unified architectures\nthat effectively process and extract features from fundamentally different\nphysiological signals.

This study addresses these issues by proposing a novel and unified\ndeep learning framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance across\ndifferent signal types. Our method integrates a ResNet-based CNN with an\nattention mechanism, enhanced by a novel data augmentation strategy:\ntime-domain concatenation of multiple augmented variants of each signal to\ngenerate richer representations. Unlike prior work, we scientifically increase\nsignal complexity to achieve future-reaching capabilities, which resulted in\nthe best predictions compared to the state of the art. Preprocessing steps\nincluded wavelet denoising, baseline removal, and standardization. Class\nimbalance was effectively managed through the combined use of this advanced\ndata augmentation and the Focal Loss function. Regularization techniques were\napplied during training to ensure generalization. We rigorously evaluated the\nproposed architecture on three benchmark datasets: UCI Seizure EEG, MIT-BIH\nArrhythmia, and PTB Diagnostic ECG. It achieved accuracies of 99.96%, 99.78%,\nand 100%, respectively, demonstrating robustness across diverse signal types\nand clinical contexts.

However, these gains often persist\neven when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted\nrewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true\nreasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific\npatterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective\nand identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,\n\\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test\nproblems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \\emph{evaluation\nfragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are\nhighly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning\nconsistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic\nevaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting\nfixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve\nmultiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across\nstructurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and\nimproving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular\nbenchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and\nVAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for\nRL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models,\nwith average declines of 48.0\\% on AMC23 and 58.3\\% on AIME24.
