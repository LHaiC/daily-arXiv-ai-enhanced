In this study, we explore the use\nof Disentangling Autoencoders (DAEs) to learn compact and interpretable\nrepresentations of spectral data in an entirely unsupervised manner.

The experiments are complemented by the density\nfunctional band structure calculations. The magnetic measurements suggest a\nhighly frustrated nature of the compound due to competing ferro- and\nantiferromagnetic interactions with the dominant one being ferromagnetic. It\nundergoes a unconventional ferromagnetic ordering at $T^* \\simeq 7.8$ K and a\nfield induced metamagnetic transition in low fields, implying spin canting. A\n$H$-$T$ phase diagram is constructed that features three phase regimes. Indeed,\nthe band structure calculations reveal dominant ferromagnetic interaction along\nthe chains that are coupled antiferromagnetically yielding a frustrated kagome\ngeometry. This compound shows a large magnetocaloric effect with isothermal\nentropy change $\\Delta S_{\\rm m} \\simeq 12$ J/kg-K, adiabatic temperature\nchange $\\Delta T_{\\rm ad} \\simeq 8.4$ K, and relative cooling power $RCP \\simeq\n349$ J/kg for a field change of 7 T. The critical analysis of magnetization and\nmagnetocaloric parameters suggests that the transition is a second order phase\ntransition and it is tricritical mean field type. Owing to it's large\nmagnetocaloric parameters, second order phase transition, and no thermal\nhysteresis, YCa$_3$(MnO)$_3$(BO$_3$)$_4$ emerges as a potential rare-earth free\nmaterial for magnetic refrigeration."}

A unified\ngrowth law -- independent of a priori assumptions about constitutive relations\nor specified structures of the growth tensor -- remains in fact elusive, as\ndoes an intimate connection between local anisotropic growth, morphogenesis\ndynamics, diffusion phenomena and mechanics. When anisotropy of growth is not\nprescribed arbitrarily, current frameworks mainly attribute shape emergence to\ngrowth-induced global configurational switches, somehow neglecting the\nexistence of local drivers of spontaneous patterning or distorsions also in\nstress-free conditions. To overcome these limitations, in this work we propose\na theoretical approach that reformulates anisotropic growth, remodeling, and\nmorphogenesis starting from first principles, grounded in mass balance. In\nparticular, by positing mass conservation as the sole dynamic constraint for\nthe growth problem, we generalize the mass balance equation to derive evolution\nlaws for mass distribution and geometric reconfiguration. This reveals how mass\ntransport and associated microstructural evolution of the tissue fabric\nsynergistically guide biological, geometric, and constitutive changes of living\nmatter, with the isochoric component of growth orchestrating local anisotropy\nand, at the macroscale, even spontaneous shape development. The proposed fully\ncoupled modelling approach integrates chemo-mechanical and biological\ninteractions inherent to living systems, offering a pathway to investigate\ncomplex scenarios in growth and morphogenesis, redefining the latter in a\nContinuum Mechanics framework. It is felt that this strategy could help to take\na step forward a unified perspective for biomechanical and mechanobiological\nproblems, bridging scales from local drivers to emergent tissue forms and\nshapes."}

Our goal is to elucidate the latter boundary layers, termed surface\nBloch (SB) waves, affiliated with rational surface cuts and homogeneous Neumann\ndata. To this end we adopt the scalar wave equation with periodic coefficients\nas a test bed and develop a unit cell-of-periodicity-based, reduced order model\nof the SB waves that is capable of describing both their dispersion, waveforms,\nand ``skin depth''. The centerpiece of our analysis is a quadratic eigenvalue\nproblem (QEP) for the effective unit cell of periodicity -- deriving from a\ngeometric interplay between the mother Bravais lattice, orientation of the\nsurface cut, and the direction of SB wave -- that seeks the complex wavenumber\nnormal to the cut plane given (i) the excitation frequency and (ii) wavenumber\nin the direction of the SB wave. In this way the sought boundary layer is\nderived via superposition of the evanescent QEP eigenstates, whose strengths\nare obtained by imposing the homogeneous Neumann boundary condition. With the\nQEP eigenspectrum at hand, evaluation of an SB wave -- in terms of both\ndispersion characteristics and evanescent waveforms -- entails only a\nlow-dimensional eigenvalue problem. This feature caters for rapid exploration\nof the effect of (periodic) surface undulations, and so enables manipulation of\nthe SB waves via optimal design of the surface cut. For completeness, our\nanalysis includes an account for the power flow and ``skin depth'' of a surface\nBloch wave, both of which are critical for the energetic relevance of boundary\nlayers."}

To\nhelp address this issue, the fifth Sexism Identification in Social Networks\n(EXIST) challenge is initiated at CLEF 2025. Among this year's international\nbenchmarks, we concentrate on solving the first task aiming to identify and\nclassify sexism in social media textual posts. In this paper, we describe our\nsolutions and report results for three subtasks: Subtask 1.1 - Sexism\nIdentification in Tweets, Subtask 1.2 - Source Intention in Tweets, and Subtask\n1.3 - Sexism Categorization in Tweets. We implement three models to address\neach subtask which constitute three individual runs: Speech Concept Bottleneck\nModel (SCBM), Speech Concept Bottleneck Model with Transformer (SCBMT), and a\nfine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa transformer model. SCBM uses descriptive adjectives as\nhuman-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models\n(LLMs) to encode input texts into a human-interpretable representation of\nadjectives, then used to train a lightweight classifier for downstream tasks.\nSCBMT extends SCBM by fusing adjective-based representation with contextual\nembeddings from transformers to balance interpretability and classification\nperformance. Beyond competitive results, these two models offer fine-grained\nexplanations at both instance (local) and class (global) levels. We also\ninvestigate how additional metadata, e.g., annotators' demographic profiles,\ncan be leveraged. For Subtask 1.1, XLM-RoBERTa, fine-tuned on provided data\naugmented with prior datasets, ranks 6th for English and Spanish and 4th for\nEnglish in the Soft-Soft evaluation. Our SCBMT achieves 7th for English and\nSpanish and 6th for Spanish."}

The simulations revealed that both boron and carbon\ndissociated from their host Ti atoms to achieve energetically favored ordering\nwith Cr, Mo, and Nb. Boron clusters formed as B2, surrounded by Mo, Nb, and Cr,\nwhile carbon preferentially clustered with Cr to form a Cr23C6 local motif and\nwith Nb to form Nb2C. Distinct preferences for interstitial sites were\nobserved, with boron favoring tetrahedral sites and carbon occupying octahedral\nsites. In the presence of a vacancy, B2 shifted from the tetrahedral site to\nthe vacancy, where it remained coordinated with Mo, Nb, and Cr. Similarly,\ncarbon utilized vacancies to form Nb2C clusters. Excess energy calculations\nshowed that B and C exhibited strong thermodynamic stability within their\nshort-range ordered configurations. However, under Ti-rich conditions, C was\nmore likely to segregate into TiC, despite preexisting ordering with Cr. This\nshift in stability suggests that increased Ti availability would alter carbide\nformation pathways, drawing C away from Cr-rich networks and promoting the\ndevelopment of TiC. Such redistribution may disrupt the continuity of Cr-based\ncarbide networks, which play a critical role in stabilizing grain boundaries\nand impeding crack propagation.

However, most current\nsystems operate in an open-loop fashion, where LLMs act as one-shot planners,\nrendering them brittle and unable to adapt to unforeseen circumstances in\ndynamic physical environments. To overcome this limitation, this paper\nintroduces the \"Think, Act, Learn\" (T-A-L) framework, a novel architecture that\nenables an embodied agent to autonomously learn and refine its policies through\ncontinuous interaction. Our framework establishes a closed-loop cycle where an\nLLM first \"thinks\" by decomposing high-level commands into actionable plans.\nThe robot then \"acts\" by executing these plans while gathering rich, multimodal\nsensory feedback. Critically, the \"learn\" module processes this feedback to\nfacilitate LLM-driven self-reflection, allowing the agent to perform causal\nanalysis on its failures and generate corrective strategies. These insights are\nstored in an experiential memory to guide future planning cycles. We\ndemonstrate through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world\nthat our T-A-L agent significantly outperforms baseline methods, including\nopen-loop LLMs, Behavioral Cloning, and traditional Reinforcement Learning. Our\nframework achieves over a 97% success rate on complex, long-horizon tasks,\nconverges to a stable policy in an average of just 9 trials, and exhibits\nremarkable generalization to unseen tasks.

This paper presents CLothes mAnipulation\nwith Semantic keyPoints (CLASP), which aims at general-purpose clothes\nmanipulation over different clothes types, T-shirts, shorts, skirts, long\ndresses, ... , as well as different tasks, folding, flattening, hanging, ... .\nThe core idea of CLASP is semantic keypoints -- e.g., ''left sleeve'', ''right\nshoulder'', etc. -- a sparse spatial-semantic representation that is salient\nfor both perception and action. Semantic keypoints of clothes can be reliably\nextracted from RGB-D images and provide an effective intermediate\nrepresentation of clothes manipulation policies. CLASP uses semantic keypoints\nto bridge high-level task planning and low-level action execution. At the high\nlevel, it exploits vision language models (VLMs) to predict task plans over the\nsemantic keypoints. At the low level, it executes the plans with the help of a\nsimple pre-built manipulation skill library. Extensive simulation experiments\nshow that CLASP outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods on multiple tasks\nacross diverse clothes types, demonstrating strong performance and\ngeneralization. Further experiments with a Franka dual-arm system on four\ndistinct tasks -- folding, flattening, hanging, and placing -- confirm CLASP's\nperformance on a real robot."}

This is because the\nmathematical design of certifiers is expressed at the neuron level, while their\nimplementations are optimized and executed at the tensor level. This mismatch\ncreates a semantic gap between design and implementation, making manual\nbridging both complex and expertise-intensive -- requiring deep knowledge in\nformal methods, high-performance computing, etc.\n  We propose a compiler framework that automatically translates neuron-level\nspecifications of DNN certifiers into tensor-based, layer-level\nimplementations.

During\nlifting, the shape analysis creates tensors in the minimal shape required to\nperform the corresponding operations. The IR also enables domain-specific\noptimizations as rewrites.

To further investigate LLMs in automatic control,\nthis work targets a key subfield: adaptive control. Inspired by the framework\nof model reference adaptive control (MRAC), we propose an LLM-guided adaptive\ncompensator framework that avoids designing controllers from scratch. Instead,\nthe LLMs are prompted using the discrepancies between an unknown system and a\nreference system to design a compensator that aligns the response of the\nunknown system with that of the reference, thereby achieving adaptivity.\nExperiments evaluate five methods: LLM-guided adaptive compensator, LLM-guided\nadaptive controller, indirect adaptive control, learning-based adaptive\ncontrol, and MRAC, on soft and humanoid robots in both simulated and real-world\nenvironments. Results show that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator outperforms\ntraditional adaptive controllers and significantly reduces reasoning complexity\ncompared to the LLM-guided adaptive controller.

However, the visual and\ntextual target-context cues derived from the initial prompts generally align\nonly with the initial target state. Due to their dynamic nature, target states\nare constantly changing, particularly in complex long-term sequences. It is\nintractable for these cues to continuously guide Vision-Language Trackers\n(VLTs). Furthermore, for the text prompts with diverse expressions, our\nexperiments reveal that existing VLTs struggle to discern which words pertain\nto the target or the context, complicating the utilization of textual cues. In\nthis work, we present a novel tracker named ATCTrack, which can obtain\nmultimodal cues Aligned with the dynamic target states through comprehensive\nTarget-Context feature modeling, thereby achieving robust tracking.\nSpecifically, (1) for the visual modality, we propose an effective temporal\nvisual target-context modeling approach that provides the tracker with timely\nvisual cues. (2) For the textual modality, we achieve precise target words\nidentification solely based on textual content, and design an innovative\ncontext words calibration method to adaptively utilize auxiliary context words.\n(3) We conduct extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks and ATCTrack\nachieves a new SOTA performance.

In particular, we propose a novel\ndecentralized observer for a group of connected agents that includes landmark\nagents (static or moving) in the environment with known positions and vehicle\nagents that need to estimate their poses (both positions and orientations).\nAssuming that (i) there are at least three landmark agents in the environment,\n(ii) each vehicle agent can measure its own angular and translational\nvelocities as well as relative bearings to at least three neighboring landmarks\nor vehicles, and (iii) neighboring vehicles can communicate their pose\nestimates, each vehicle can estimate its own pose using the proposed\ndecentralized observer. We prove that the origin of the estimation error is\nlocally exponentially stable under the proposed observer, provided that the\nminimal observability conditions are satisfied.

By jointly exploiting low\nand high-frequency information and introducing adaptive guidance across\nmodalities, WMNet alleviates the adverse effects of noise, illumination\nvariation, and spatial misalignment. Furthermore, it enhances the\nrepresentation of salient target features while suppressing spurious or\nmisleading information, thereby promoting more accurate and robust detection.\nExtensive evaluations on the DVTOD, DroneVehicle, and M3FD datasets demonstrate\nthat WMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on misaligned cross-modal\nobject detection tasks, confirming its effectiveness and practical\napplicability."}

Specifically,\nwe focus on inserting bracelets into dynamic wrist scenes, leveraging the high\ntemporal consistency of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for initial rendering and\nrefining the results using a 2D diffusion-based enhancement model to ensure\nrealistic lighting interactions. Our method introduces a shading-driven\npipeline that separates intrinsic object properties (albedo, shading,\nreflectance) and refines both shading and sRGB images for photorealism. To\nmaintain temporal coherence, we optimize the 3DGS model with multi-frame\nweighted adjustments. This is the first approach to synergize 3D rendering and\n2D diffusion for video object insertion, offering a robust solution for\nrealistic and consistent video editing.

However, it often produces\nbrittle and unstable policies, leading to critical failures such as spurious\nreasoning, deceptive alignment, and instruction disobedience that undermine the\ntrustworthiness and safety of LLMs/LRMs. Currently, these issues lack a unified\ntheoretical explanation and are typically addressed using ad-hoc heuristics.\nThis paper presents a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the\nstability of the mapping from a reward function to the optimal policy. We show\nthat policy brittleness often stems from non-unique optimal actions, a common\noccurrence when multiple valid traces exist in a reasoning task. This\ntheoretical lens provides a unified explanation for a range of seemingly\ndisparate failures, reframing them as rational outcomes of optimizing rewards\nthat may be incomplete or noisy, especially in the presence of action\ndegeneracy. We extend this analysis from the fundamental single-reward setting\nto the more realistic multi-reward RL across diverse domains, showing how\nstability is governed by an \"effective reward\" aggregation mechanism. We also\nprove that entropy regularization restores policy stability at the cost of\nincreased stochasticity. Our framework provides a unified explanation for\nrecent empirical findings on deceptive reasoning, instruction-following\ntrade-offs, and RLHF-induced sophistry, and is further validated through\nperturbation experiments in multi-reward RL. This work advances\npolicy-stability analysis from empirical heuristics towards a principled\ntheory, offering essential insights for designing safer and more trustworthy AI\nsystems."}

This gives GACL a nice geometric interpretation (the\nbetter the quality, the easier the recognition), and makes it agnostic to both\nnetwork architecture changes and the underlying sketch representation. Through\na large scale human study of 160,000 \\doublecheck{trials}, we confirm the\nagreement between our GACL-induced metric and human quality perception. We\nfurther demonstrate how such a quality assessment capability can for the first\ntime enable three practical sketch applications. Interestingly, we show GACL\nnot only works on abstract visual representations such as sketch but also\nextends well to natural images on the problem of image quality assessment\n(IQA). Last but not least, we spell out the general properties of GACL as\ngeneral-purpose data re-weighting strategy and demonstrate its applications in\nvertical problems such as noisy label cleansing.

This paper endeavors to\nbridge this gap by systematically reviewing the state-of-the-art literature.\nSpecifically, we provide a thorough survey of the field from three key\nperspectives: data, methods, and applications, covering a range of methods\nincluding both monocular and stereo approaches. We describe common performance\nevaluation metrics and summarize publicly available datasets. Furthermore, this\nreview analyzes the specific challenges of endoscopic scenes and categorizes\nrepresentative techniques based on their supervision strategies and network\narchitectures. The application of endoscopic depth estimation in the important\narea of robot-assisted surgery is also reviewed. Finally, we outline potential\ndirections for future research, such as domain adaptation, real-time\nimplementation, and enhanced model generalization, thereby providing a valuable\nstarting point for researchers to engage with and advance the field."}

Camera\nparameters, such as exposure time, also influence the appearance of snowflakes,\nmaking the problem difficult to solve and heavily dependent on network\ngeneralization. In this paper, we propose to address the challenge of desnowing\nby using event cameras, which offer compressed visual information with\nsubmillisecond latency, making them ideal for de-snowing images, even in the\npresence of ego-motion. Our method leverages the fact that snowflake occlusions\nappear with a very distinctive streak signature in the spatio-temporal\nrepresentation of event data.

In this work, we address these gaps\nby (i) aggregating existing rehabilitation datasets into a unified archive\ncalled Rehab-Pile, (ii) proposing a general benchmarking framework for\nevaluating deep learning methods in this domain, and (iii) conducting extensive\nbenchmarking of multiple architectures across classification and regression\ntasks. All datasets and implementations are released to the community to\nsupport transparency and reproducibility. This paper aims to establish a solid\nfoundation for future research in automated rehabilitation assessment and\nfoster the development of reliable, accessible, and personalized rehabilitation\nsolutions. The datasets, source-code and results of this article are all\npublicly available."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce\nGPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M, a publicly available, large-scale image-editing corpus\ncontaining more than 1.5 million high-quality triplets (instruction, source\nimage, edited image). We systematically construct this dataset by leveraging\nthe versatile capabilities of GPT-4o to unify and refine three popular\nimage-editing datasets: OmniEdit, HQ-Edit, and UltraEdit. Specifically, our\nmethodology involves 1) regenerating output images to enhance visual quality\nand instruction alignment, and 2) selectively rewriting prompts to improve\nsemantic clarity. To validate the efficacy of our dataset, we fine-tune\nadvanced open-source models on GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M.

The paper introduces\nseveral approaches for binary segmentation of navigable surfaces versus\nbackground from 3D point clouds of metallic trusses. These methods fall into\ntwo categories: analytical algorithms and deep learning models. The analytical\napproach features a custom algorithm that segments structures by analyzing the\neigendecomposition of planar patches in the point cloud. In parallel, advanced\ndeep learning models PointNet, PointNet++, MinkUNet34C, and PointTransformerV3\nare trained and evaluated for the same task. Comparative analysis shows that\nthe analytical algorithm offers easier parameter tuning and performance\ncomparable to deep learning models, which, while more computationally\nintensive, excel in segmentation accuracy. Notably, PointTransformerV3 achieves\na Mean Intersection Over Union (mIoU) of about 97%. The study demonstrates the\npromise of both analytical and deep learning methods for improving autonomous\nnavigation in complex truss environments. The results highlight the trade-offs\nbetween computational efficiency and segmentation performance, providing\nvaluable guidance for future research and practical applications in autonomous\ninfrastructure inspection and maintenance."}

However, the inherent imbalance in multimodal\nknowledge graphs, where modality distributions vary across entities, poses\nchallenges in utilizing additional modality data for robust entity\nrepresentation. Existing MMKGC methods typically rely on attention or\ngate-based fusion mechanisms but overlook complementarity contained in\nmulti-modal data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Mixture of\nComplementary Modality Experts (MoCME), which consists of a\nComplementarity-guided Modality Knowledge Fusion (CMKF) module and an\nEntropy-guided Negative Sampling (EGNS) mechanism. The CMKF module exploits\nboth intra-modal and inter-modal complementarity to fuse multi-view and\nmulti-modal embeddings, enhancing representations of entities. Additionally, we\nintroduce an Entropy-guided Negative Sampling mechanism to dynamically\nprioritize informative and uncertain negative samples to enhance training\neffectiveness and model robustness. Extensive experiments on five benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that our MoCME achieves state-of-the-art performance,\nsurpassing existing approaches."}

Current parameter reduction\ntechniques primarily involve training MLLMs from Small Language Models (SLMs),\nbut these methods offer limited flexibility and remain computationally\nintensive. To address this gap, we propose to directly compress existing MLLMs\nthrough structural pruning combined with efficient recovery training.\nSpecifically, we investigate two structural pruning paradigms--layerwise and\nwidthwise pruning--applied to the language model backbone of MLLMs, alongside\nsupervised finetuning and knowledge distillation. Additionally, we assess the\nfeasibility of conducting recovery training with only a small fraction of the\navailable data. Our results show that widthwise pruning generally maintains\nbetter performance in low-resource scenarios with limited computational\nresources or insufficient finetuning data. As for the recovery training,\nfinetuning only the multimodal projector is sufficient at small compression\nlevels (< 20%). Furthermore, a combination of supervised finetuning and\nhidden-state distillation yields optimal recovery across various pruning\nlevels. Notably, effective recovery can be achieved with as little as 5% of the\noriginal training data, while retaining over 95% of the original performance.\nThrough empirical study on two representative MLLMs, i.e., LLaVA-v1.5-7B and\nBunny-v1.0-3B, this study offers actionable insights for practitioners aiming\nto compress MLLMs effectively without extensive computation resources or\nsufficient data."}

This paper presents SAE Debias, a lightweight and model-agnostic\nframework for mitigating such bias in T2I generation. Unlike prior approaches\nthat rely on CLIP-based filtering or prompt engineering, which often require\nmodel-specific adjustments and offer limited control, SAE Debias operates\ndirectly within the feature space without retraining or architectural\nmodifications. By leveraging a k-sparse autoencoder pre-trained on a gender\nbias dataset, the method identifies gender-relevant directions within the\nsparse latent space, capturing professional stereotypes. Specifically, a biased\ndirection per profession is constructed from sparse latents and suppressed\nduring inference to steer generations toward more gender-balanced outputs.\nTrained only once, the sparse autoencoder provides a reusable debiasing\ndirection, offering effective control and interpretable insight into biased\nsubspaces. Extensive evaluations across multiple T2I models, including Stable\nDiffusion 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, and SDXL, demonstrate that SAE Debias substantially\nreduces gender bias while preserving generation quality. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first work to apply sparse autoencoders for identifying\nand intervening in gender bias within T2I models.

Project page:\n  https://jacky1128.github.io/RepMTL/", "summary": "Despite the promise of Multi-Task Learning in leveraging complementary\nknowledge across tasks, existing multi-task optimization (MTO) techniques\nremain fixated on resolving conflicts via optimizer-centric loss scaling and\ngradient manipulation strategies, yet fail to deliver consistent gains. In this\npaper, we argue that the shared representation space, where task interactions\nnaturally occur, offers rich information and potential for operations\ncomplementary to existing optimizers, especially for facilitating the\ninter-task complementarity, which is rarely explored in MTO. This intuition\nleads to Rep-MTL, which exploits the representation-level task saliency to\nquantify interactions between task-specific optimization and shared\nrepresentation learning. By steering these saliencies through entropy-based\npenalization and sample-wise cross-task alignment, Rep-MTL aims to mitigate\nnegative transfer by maintaining the effective training of individual tasks\ninstead pure conflict-solving, while explicitly promoting complementary\ninformation sharing. Experiments are conducted on four challenging MTL\nbenchmarks covering both task-shift and domain-shift scenarios. The results\nshow that Rep-MTL, even paired with the basic equal weighting policy, achieves\ncompetitive performance gains with favorable efficiency. Beyond standard\nperformance metrics, Power Law exponent analysis demonstrates Rep-MTL's\nefficacy in balancing task-specific learning and cross-task sharing.
