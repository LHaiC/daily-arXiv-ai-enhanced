Specifically, the demand function for each seller $i$ follows the single index model $\u03bb_i(\\mathbf{p}) = \u03bc_i(\\langle \\boldsymbol\u03b8_{i,0}, \\mathbf{p} \\rangle)$, with known increasing link $\u03bc_i$ and unknown parameter $\\boldsymbol\u03b8_{i,0}$, where the vector $\\mathbf{p}$ denotes the vector of prices offered by all the sellers simultaneously at a given instant. Each seller observes only their own realized demand -- unobservable to competitors -- and the prices set by rivals. Our framework generalizes existing approaches that focus solely on linear demand models. We propose a novel decentralized policy, PML-GLUCB, that combines penalized MLE with an upper-confidence pricing rule, removing the need for coordinated exploration phases across sellers -- which is integral to previous linear models -- and accommodating both binary and real-valued demand observations. Relative to a dynamic benchmark policy, each seller achieves $O(N^{2}\\sqrt{T}\\log(T))$ regret, which essentially matches the optimal rate known in the linear setting.

This makes them lucrative targets for attacks. Today, we see an ongoing battle between criminals that try to disrupt our key communication networks and security professionals that try to mitigate these attacks. However, today's networks, like the Internet or peer-to-peer networks among smart devices, are not controlled by a single authority, but instead consist of many independently administrated entities that are interconnected. Thus, both the decisions of how to interconnect and how to secure against potential attacks are taken in a decentralized way by selfish agents.\n  This strategic setting, with agents that want to interconnect and potential attackers that want to disrupt the network, was captured via an influential game-theoretic model by Goyal, Jabbari, Kearns, Khanna, and Morgenstern (WINE 2016). We revisit this model and show improved tight bounds on the achieved robustness of networks created by selfish agents. As our main result, we show that such networks can resist attacks of a large class of potential attackers, i.e., these networks maintain asymptotically optimal welfare post attack. This improves several bounds and resolves an open problem. Along the way, we show the counter-intuitive result, that attackers that aim at minimizing the social welfare post attack do not actually inflict the greatest possible damage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5b58\u5728\u81ea\u79c1\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u8005\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u4e5f\u80fd\u62b5\u5fa1\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u3002", "motivation": "\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u7531\u81ea\u79c1\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u7ba1\u7406\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e00\u4e2a\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u7531\u81ea\u79c1\u4ee3\u7406\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u6240\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u754c\u9650\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u754c\u9650\u5185\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f51\u7edc\u53ef\u4ee5\u62b5\u5fa1\u4e00\u5927\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u8005\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u906d\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u540e\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\u6e10\u8fdb\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u65e8\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u653b\u51fb\u540e\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u9020\u6210\u7684\u635f\u5bb3\u5e76\u975e\u6700\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7531\u81ea\u79c1\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u5177\u6709\u5f88\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u62b5\u5fa1\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6e10\u8fdb\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Marden"], "title": "Playing with Peaks: A Game-Theoretic Comparison of Electricity Pricing Mechanisms", "comment": null, "summary": "As electricity consumption grows, reducing peak demand--the maximum load on the grid--has become critical for preventing infrastructure strain and blackouts. Pricing mechanisms that incentivize consumers with flexible loads to shift consumption away from high-demand periods have emerged as effective tools, yet different mechanisms are used in practice with unclear relative performance. This work compares two widely implemented approaches: anytime peak pricing (AP), where consumers pay for their individual maximum consumption, and coincident peak pricing (CP), where consumers pay for their consumption during the system-wide peak period. To compare these mechanisms, we model the electricity market as a strategic game and characterize the peak demand in equilibrium under both AP and CP. Our main result demonstrates that with perfect information, equilibrium peak demand under CP never exceeds that under AP; on the other hand, with imperfect information, the coordination introduced by CP can backfire and induce larger equilibrium peaks than AP. These findings demonstrate that potential gains from coupling users' costs (as done in CP) must be weighed against these miscoordination risks. We conclude with preliminary results indicating that progressive demand cost structures--rather than per-unit charges--may mitigate these risks while preserving coordination benefits, achieving desirable performance in both deterministic and stochastic settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u5cf0\u7528\u7535\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5b9a\u4ef7\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u968f\u65f6\u9ad8\u5cf0\u5b9a\u4ef7\uff08AP\uff09\u548c\u540c\u6b65\u9ad8\u5cf0\u5b9a\u4ef7\uff08CP\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7528\u7535\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u5cf0\u9700\u6c42\u5bf9\u9632\u6b62\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u538b\u529b\u548c\u505c\u7535\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5176\u76f8\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86AP\u548cCP\u4e0b\u7684\u5747\u8861\u72b6\u6001\u5cf0\u503c\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0b\uff0cCP\u7684\u5747\u8861\u5cf0\u503c\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u9ad8\u4e8eAP\u3002\u4f46\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0b\uff0cCP\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6bd4AP\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5747\u8861\u5cf0\u503c\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "CP\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6536\u76ca\u9700\u8981\u4e0e\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u4e0d\u534f\u8c03\u98ce\u9669\u8fdb\u884c\u6743\u8861\u3002\u521d\u6b65\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7d2f\u8fdb\u9700\u6c42\u6210\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u80fd\u51cf\u8f7b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u76ca\u5904\u3002"}}

In an online cooperative game, players arrive in an unknown order, and the value increase after each player arrived should be distributed immediately among all the arrived players. Although there is only one arriving order in the game, we also hope that the value distribution is equal to their Shapley value in expectation. To achieve these goals, the early solutions ignored the fairness in each single arriving order. More specifically, an important player may receive nothing in a game, which seems unfair in reality. To combat this, we propose refined fairness in this paper and design new solutions in 0-1 value games. Specifically, we compute the distance of the distribution in each order to the Shapley value and aim to minimize it. We propose a new mechanism called Egalitarian Value-Sharing (EVS) to do so.

The ground-state languages have exponential growth constants $\u03bb_K$ that decrease monotonically, starting from the value associated with the ``golden chain'' (approximately 1.618) and progressing toward 1. This process yields a staircase of topological-entropy plateaus that flows to an aperiodic fixed point, also known as the Fibonacci subshift. The first nontrivial rung ($K=4$) is the ``Plastic chain,'' which forbids \\texttt{SS} and \\texttt{LLL}. We prove its ground-state counts follow a specific four-term linear recurrence relation and provide a closed-form solution governed by the plastic constant $\u03c1\\approx 1.3247$. We propose an energy-entropy scaling where the energy penalty for each new forbidden pattern is proportional to the logarithmic ratio of the growth constants from the previous and current rungs, turning the sequence of projectors into an explicit renormalization-group flow from the initial high-entropy phase to the zero-entropy aperiodic fixed point. Algebraically, exact Temperley-Lieb braiding compatibility holds only at the base rung, $K=3$ (which forbids only \\texttt{SS}); higher rungs define constrained aperiodic Hamiltonian codes rather than Temperley-Lieb representations. Small instances realized on a D-Wave quantum annealer match these predictions: $K=3$ is trivial, $K=4$ resolves a unit gap with moderate success, and $K\\ge 5$ instances require reverse annealing to exceed $99\\%$ success, clarifying reduction penalties and embedding variability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6590\u6ce2\u90a3\u5951\u8bcd\u7684\u65e0\u9650\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u81ea\u9876\u5411\u4e0b\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7981\u6b62\u7279\u5b9a\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u6590\u6ce2\u90a3\u5951\u8bcd\u56e0\u5b50\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8be5\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\u5e38\u6570\u5355\u8c03\u9012\u51cf\uff0c\u5e76\u8d8b\u4e8e1\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u5f80\u6590\u6ce2\u90a3\u5951\u5b50\u79fb\u4f4d\u7684\u975e\u5468\u671f\u4e0d\u52a8\u70b9\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\uff0c$K=4$\u7684\u201c\u5851\u80f6\u94fe\u201d\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u56db\u9879\u7ebf\u6027\u9012\u63a8\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7531\u5851\u80f6\u5e38\u6570\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u91cf-\u71b5\u6807\u5ea6\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5c06\u6295\u5f71\u5e8f\u5217\u89c6\u4e3a\u4ece\u9ad8\u71b5\u76f8\u5230\u96f6\u71b5\u4e0d\u52a8\u70b9\u7684\u91cd\u6b63\u5316\u7fa4\u6d41\u3002\u4ee3\u6570\u4e0a\uff0c\u53ea\u6709$K=3$\u7684\u57fa\u5e95\u7ef3\u5177\u6709Temperley-Lieb\u8fab\u5b50\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002\u5728D-Wave\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u5668\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c$K$\u503c\u4e0b\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u60e9\u7f5a\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9650\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u81ea\u9876\u5411\u4e0b\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u57fa\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u589e\u957f\u5e38\u6570\u3001\u62d3\u6251\u71b5\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7981\u6b62\u6590\u6ce2\u90a3\u5951\u8bcd\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u56e0\u5b50\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u589e\u957f\u5e38\u6570\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u9012\u63a8\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u80fd\u91cf-\u71b5\u6807\u5ea6\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5728D-Wave\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u5668\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u57fa\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u589e\u957f\u5e38\u6570\u5355\u8c03\u9012\u51cf\u5e76\u8d8b\u4e8e1\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u5e73\u53f0\u3002\u5851\u80f6\u94fe\uff08K=4\uff09\u7684\u57fa\u6001\u8ba1\u6570\u9075\u5faa\u4e00\u4e2a\u56db\u9879\u7ebf\u6027\u9012\u63a8\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7531\u5851\u80f6\u5e38\u6570\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c$K$\u503c\u4e0b\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u60e9\u7f5a\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6590\u6ce2\u90a3\u5951\u8bcd\u7684\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5176\u6027\u8d28\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u975e\u5468\u671f\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

However, conventional I/O circuitry, including electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection and signaling, introduces significant area overhead. Prior studies have identified this overhead as a major constraint in reducing chiplet size below 100 mm2. In this study, we revisit reliability requirements from the perspective of chiplet interface design. Through parasitic extraction and SPICE simulations, we demonstrate that ESD protection and inter-chiplet signaling can be substantially simplified in future 2.5D/3D packaging technologies. Such simplification, in turn, paves the road for further chiplet miniaturization and improves the composability and reusability of tiny chiplets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Chiplet\u5c01\u88c5\u4e2d\u7684ESD\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u8f93\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u7b80\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u82af\u7247\u5c3a\u5bf8\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684I/O\u7535\u8def\uff08\u5305\u62ecESD\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u8f93\uff09\u57282.5D/3D\u5f02\u6784\u96c6\u6210\u4e2d\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u9762\u79ef\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u82af\u7247\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u5316\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u82af\u7247\u63a5\u53e3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4ee5\u671f\u7b80\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9bI/O\u7535\u8def\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bc4\u751f\u53c2\u6570\u63d0\u53d6\u548cSPICE\u4eff\u771f\uff0c\u8bba\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728\u672a\u6765\u76842.5D/3D\u5c01\u88c5\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\uff0cESD\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u82af\u7247\u95f4\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u8f93\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f97\u5230\u7b80\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cESD\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u82af\u7247\u95f4\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c06\u4e3a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7f29\u5c0f\u82af\u7247\u5c3a\u5bf8\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u5c0f\u578b\u82af\u7247\u7684\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u6027\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5316ESD\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u82af\u7247\u95f4\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c0f\u82af\u7247\u5c3a\u5bf8\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u82af\u7247\u7684\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63a8\u52a82.5D/3D\u5f02\u6784\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Furthermore, the nature of crowdsourcing dictates the budget for tasks and workers' remuneration, and excessively large team sizes may reduce collaborative performance. To address these challenges, we propose a heuristic optimization algorithm that leverages social network information to simultaneously form teams with optimized worker compatibility for multiple tasks. In our approach, historical collaboration is represented as a social network, where the edge weights correspond to explicit ratings of worker compatibility. In a simulation experiment using synthetic data, we applied Gaussian process regression to examine the relationship between eight experimental parameters and evaluation values, thereby analyzing the output of the proposed algorithm. To generate the necessary data for regression, we ran the proposed algorithm with experimental parameters that were sequentially estimated using Bayesian optimization. Our experiments revealed that the evaluation values were extremely low when the team size limit, the degree mean of the social network, and the task budget were set to low values. The results also indicate that the proposed algorithm outperformed the hill-climbing method under almost all experimental conditions. In addition, the highest evaluation values were achieved when the simulated annealing temperature decrease rate was approximately 0.9, while smoothing the objective function proved ineffective.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u4fe1\u606f\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u56e2\u961f\u7ec4\u5efa\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4f17\u5305\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651 worker \u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u7ec4\u5efa\u56e2\u961f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8981\u8003\u8651\u9884\u7b97\u548c\u56e2\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\u5bf9\u534f\u4f5c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u8fb9\u6743\u91cd\u4e3a worker \u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\uff09\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u7ec4\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u5316 worker \u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u56e2\u961f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u6790\u7b97\u6cd5\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u722c\u5c71\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u56e2\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\u9650\u5236\u3001\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u5ea6\u5747\u503c\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u9884\u7b97\u8f83\u4f4e\u65f6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u503c\u6781\u4f4e\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u51e0\u4e4e\u6240\u6709\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u722c\u5c71\u6cd5\u3002\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\u964d\u6e29\u901f\u7387\u7ea6\u4e3a 0.9 \u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u9ad8\u8bc4\u4f30\u503c\uff0c\u800c\u5e73\u6ed1\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u65e0\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u56e2\u961f\u7ec4\u5efa\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u722c\u5c71\u6cd5\u3002\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u56e2\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u9884\u7b97\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Computing the full NTK matrix is often infeasible, especially for recurrent architectures. Here, we introduce a matrix-free perspective, using trace estimation to rapidly analyze the empirical, finite-width NTK. This enables fast computation of the NTK's trace, Frobenius norm, effective rank, and alignment. We provide numerical recipes based on the Hutch++ trace estimator with provably fast convergence guarantees. In addition, we show that, due to the structure of the NTK, one can compute the trace using only forward- or reverse-mode automatic differentiation, not requiring both modes. We show these so-called one-sided estimators can outperform Hutch++ in the low-sample regime, especially when the gap between the model state and parameter count is large.

However, these powerful representations can encode a broad range of task-irrelevant scene information, making the resulting trained policies vulnerable to out-of-domain visual changes and distractors. In this work we address visuomotor policy feature pooling as a solution to the observed lack of robustness in perturbed scenes. We achieve this via Attentive Feature Aggregation (AFA), a lightweight, trainable pooling mechanism that learns to naturally attend to task-relevant visual cues, ignoring even semantically rich scene distractors. Through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world, we demonstrate that policies trained with AFA significantly outperform standard pooling approaches in the presence of visual perturbations, without requiring expensive dataset augmentation or fine-tuning of the PVR.

This paper investigates target detection in a bistatic ISAC system, in which the base station (BS) transmits superimposed ISAC signals comprising both Gaussian information-bearing and deterministic sensing components to simultaneously provide communication and sensing functionalities. First, we develop a Neyman-Pearson (NP)-based detector that effectively utilizes both the deterministic sensing and random communication signals. Closed-form analysis reveals that both signal components contribute to improving the overall detection performance. Subsequently, we optimize the BS transmit beamforming to maximize the detection probability, subject to a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint for the communication user (CU) and a total transmit power budget at the BS. The resulting non-convex beamforming optimization problem is addressed via semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed NP-based detector, which leverages both types of signals, over benchmark schemes that treat information signals as interference. They also reveal that a higher communication-rate threshold directs more transmit power to Gaussian information-bearing signals, thereby diminishing deterministic-signal power and weakening detection performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u96c6\u6210\u4f20\u611f\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\uff08ISAC\uff09\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u53cc\u91cd\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u7ad9ISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eNeyman-Pearson\uff08NP\uff09\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u57fa\u7ad9\uff08BS\uff09\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u901a\u4fe1\u7528\u6237\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u4fe1\u5e72\u566a\u6bd4\uff08SINR\uff09\u7ea6\u675f\u548cBS\u7684\u603b\u53d1\u5c04\u529f\u7387\u9884\u7b97\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u53cc\u7ad9ISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eNP\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u8be5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u611f\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u4fe1\u606f\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u534a\u5b9a\u677e\u5f1b\uff08SDR\uff09\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u51f8\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff08SCA\uff09\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u975e\u51f8\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684NP\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u5229\u7528\u4f20\u611f\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u901f\u7387\u9608\u503c\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u529f\u7387\u88ab\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u9ad8\u65af\u4fe1\u606f\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u800c\u727a\u7272\u4e86\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u611f\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684NP\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u901a\u4fe1\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347ISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4f46\u901a\u4fe1\u901f\u7387\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

Submitted to Energy and AI", "summary": "Real-time energy forecasting on edge devices represents a major challenge for smart grid optimization and intelligent buildings. We present LAD-BNet (Lag-Aware Dual-Branch Network), an innovative neural architecture optimized for edge inference with Google Coral TPU. Our hybrid approach combines a branch dedicated to explicit exploitation of temporal lags with a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) featuring dilated convolutions, enabling simultaneous capture of short and long-term dependencies. Tested on real energy consumption data with 10-minute temporal resolution, LAD-BNet achieves 14.49% MAPE at 1-hour horizon with only 18ms inference time on Edge TPU, representing an 8-12 x acceleration compared to CPU.

In this work, we examine the transport properties of two dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) in single- and multi-channel AlScN/GaN heterostructures grown by molecular beam epitaxy, and demonstrate the lowest sheet resistance among AlScN-based systems reported to date. Assorted schemes of GaN/AlN interlayers are first introduced in single-channel structures between AlScN and GaN to improve conductivity, increasing electron mobility up to $1370$ cm$^{2}$/V$\\cdot$s at 300 K and $4160$ cm$^{2}$/V$\\cdot$s at 77 K, reducing the sheet resistance down to 170 $\u03a9/\\square$ and 70 $\u03a9/\\square$ respectively. These improvements are then leveraged in multi-channel heterostructures, reaching sheet resistances of 65 $\u03a9/\\square$ for three channels and 45 $\u03a9/\\square$ for five channels at 300 K, further reduced to 21 $\u03a9/\\square$ and 13 $\u03a9/\\square$ at 2 K, respectively, confirming the presence of multiple 2DEGs. Structural characterization indicates pseudomorphic growth with smooth surfaces, while partial barrier relaxation and surface roughening are observed at high scandium content, with no impact on mobility.

To address these issues, the FengHuang Platform, a disaggregated AI infrastructure platform, is proposed to overcome memory and communication scaling limits for AI inference. FengHuang features a multi-tier shared-memory architecture combining high-speed local memory with centralized disaggregated remote memory, enhanced by active tensor paging and near-memory compute for tensor operations. Simulations demonstrate that FengHuang achieves up to 93% local memory capacity reduction, 50% GPU compute savings, and 16x to 70x faster inter-GPU communication compared to conventional GPU scaling.

While notions like differential privacy have been successfully introduced to dynamical systems, it is still unclear how a system's privacy can be properly protected when facing the challenging yet frequently-encountered scenario where an adversary possesses prior knowledge, e.g., the steady state, of the system. This paper presents a new systematic approach to protect the privacy of a discrete-time linear time-invariant system against adversaries knowledgeable of the system's prior information. We employ a tailored \\emph{pointwise maximal leakage (PML) privacy} criterion. PML characterizes the worst-case privacy performance, which is sharply different from that of the better-known mutual-information privacy. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for PML privacy and construct tractable design procedures. Furthermore, our analysis leads to insight into how PML privacy, differential privacy, and mutual-information privacy are related. We then revisit Kalman filters from the perspective of PML privacy and derive a lower bound on the steady-state estimation-error covariance in terms of the PML parameters.

For gradient-based optimizers, we define this entropy over a finite set of goals {g_i} as S = -\u03a3 p(g_i; theta) ln p(g_i; theta), and we prove that its time derivative dS/dt >= 0, driven by exploration noise and specification gaming. We derive the critical stability boundary for alignment work as gamma_crit = (lambda_max / 2) ln N, where lambda_max is the dominant eigenvalue of the Fisher Information Matrix and N is the number of model parameters. Simulations validate this theory. A 7-billion-parameter model (N = 7 x 10^9) with lambda_max = 1.2 drifts from an initial entropy of 0.32 to 1.69 +/- 1.08 nats, while a system regularized with alignment work gamma = 20.4 (1.5 gamma_crit) maintains stability at 0.00 +/- 0.00 nats (p = 4.19 x 10^-17, n = 20 trials).

The attacker strategically removes up to $k$ edges from a flow network to maximally disrupt flow between a source $s$ and a sink $t$, after which the defender optimally reroutes the remaining flow. To capture this attacker--defender interaction, we introduce a new mathematical model of discounted cuts, in which the cost of a cut is evaluated by excluding its $k$ most expensive edges. This model generalizes the Most Vital Links problem and uncovers novel algorithmic and complexity-theoretic properties.\n  We develop a unified algorithmic framework for analyzing various forms of discounted cut problems, including minimizing or maximizing the cost of a cut under discount mechanisms that exclude either the $k$ most expensive or the $k$ cheapest edges. While most variants are NP-complete on general graphs, our main result establishes polynomial-time solvability for all discounted cut problems in our framework when the input is restricted to bounded-genus graphs, a relevant class that includes many real-world networks such as transportation and infrastructure networks.

This paper asks a precise, testable version of the \"runaway growth\" question: under what measurable conditions could capability escalate without bound in finite time, and under what conditions can that be ruled out? We develop an analytic framework for recursive self-improvement that links capability growth to resource build-out and deployment policies. Physical and information-theoretic limits from power, bandwidth, and memory define a service envelope that caps instantaneous improvement. An endogenous growth model couples capital to compute, data, and energy and defines a critical boundary separating superlinear from subcritical regimes. We derive decision rules that map observable series (facility power, IO bandwidth, training throughput, benchmark losses, and spending) into yes/no certificates for runaway versus nonsingular behavior. The framework yields falsifiable tests based on how fast improvement accelerates relative to its current level, and it provides safety controls that are directly implementable in practice, such as power caps, throughput throttling, and evaluation gates. Analytical case studies cover capped-power, saturating-data, and investment-amplified settings, illustrating when the envelope binds and when it does not. The approach is simulation-free and grounded in measurements engineers already collect. Limitations include dependence on the chosen capability metric and on regularity diagnostics; future work will address stochastic dynamics, multi-agent competition, and abrupt architectural shifts.

These games pose a major challenge due to the absence of a principled connection with dynamic programming (DP) techniques developed for two-player zero-sum stochastic games (zs-SGs). Prior attempts at transferring solution methods have lacked a lossless reduction, defined here as a transformation that preserves value functions, equilibrium strategies, and optimality structure, thereby limiting generalisation to ad-hoc algorithms. This work introduces the first lossless reduction from zs-POSGs to transition-independent zs-SGs, enabling the principled application of a broad class of DP-based methods. We show empirically that point-based value iteration (PBVI) algorithms, applied via this reduction, produce \u03b5-optimal strategies across a range of benchmark domains, consistently matching or outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

We propose a theoretical framework that unifies cooperative game-theoretic attribution with process reward modeling to transform system evaluation into agent credit and then into response-level signals. Unlike prior approaches that rely only on attribution (e.g., Shapley) or step-level labels (e.g., PRM), our method produces local, signed, and credit-conserving signals. In success cases, Shapley-based credit assignment fairly allocates outcomes across agents and is refined into per-message rewards that promote cooperation while discouraging redundancy or sabotage. In failure cases, first-error localization yields repair-aware preferences that penalize harmful steps while rewarding corrective attempts. The resulting signals are bounded, cooperative, and directly compatible with reinforcement-based or preference-based post-training, providing a unified and auditable pathway from global evaluation to local supervision in LLM multi-agent training.

Invited talk at the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Quantum Control, Computing and Learning (IEEE qCCL2025), Hong Kong, June 2025. Published in the proceedings, pp. 39-42", "summary": "Machine learning models are used for pattern recognition analysis of big data, without direct human intervention. The task of unsupervised learning is to find the probability distribution that would best describe the available data, and then use it to make predictions for observables of interest. Classical models generally fit the data to Boltzmann distribution of Hamiltonians with a large number of tunable parameters. Quantum extensions of these models replace classical probability distributions with quantum density matrices. An advantage can be obtained only when features of density matrices that are absent in classical probability distributions are exploited. Such situations depend on the input data as well as the targeted observables. Explicit examples are discussed that bring out the constraints limiting possible quantum advantage.

Despite their growing use, few devices have been specifically designed for monitoring liquids under photoexcitation, a promising approach for fast structural transitions. Here, a microfluidic device that is transparent to X-rays in one direction, and simulaneously transmits UV and visible light in the perpendicular direction is presented. The device is fabricated using lamination and UV lithography on a dry-film resist, eliminating the need for cleanroom facilities and simplifying production. Its multi-wavelength transparency was validated through UV-visible spectroscopy, where photoexcitation at different wavelengths induced reversible trans-to-cis isomerization of azobenzene and fluoro-azobenzene. X-ray transparency was validated through Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) measurements on hemoglobin and CO-ligated hemoglobin sensitive to quaternary structural changes. These resusts confirm the suitability of the device for resolving protein structures and photoinduced conformational dynamics.

We introduce Heron's Information Coefficient (HIC), a geometric measure that quantifies how subgraphs deviate from the global structure of a network. Applied to over eight years of Brazilian bidding data for medical supplies, this measure highlights collusive patterns that standard indicators may overlook. Unlike conventional robustness metrics, the Heron coefficient focuses on the interaction between active and inactive subgraphs, revealing structural shifts that may signal coordinated behavior, such as cartel formation. Synthetic experiments support these findings, demonstrating strong detection performance across varying corruption intensities and network sizes. While our results do not replace legal or economic analyses, they offer an effective complementary tool for auditors and policymakers to monitor procurement integrity more effectively.

This paper reports on a pilot deployment of an ARI social robot functioning as a university receptionist, designed in alignment with the SecuRoPS framework for secure and ethical social robot deployment. Thirty-five students and staff interacted with the robot and provided structured feedback on safety, privacy, usability, accessibility, and transparency. The results show generally positive perceptions of physical safety, data protection, and ethical behavior, while also highlighting challenges related to accessibility, inclusiveness, and dynamic interaction. Beyond the empirical findings, the study demonstrates how theoretical frameworks for ethical and secure design can be implemented in real-world contexts through end-user evaluation. It also provides a public GitHub repository containing reusable templates for ARI robot applications to support reproducibility and lower the entry barrier for new researchers.

These modifications enhance graph fidelity while preserving the core spectral reasoning pipeline. Experimental results on ProofWriter, EntailmentBank, and CLUTRR benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains (up to +3.8\\%), improved generalization to adversarial cases, and reduced inference noise. The novelty lies in performing semantic and symbolic refinement entirely upstream of the spectral inference stage, enabling efficient, interpretable, and scalable reasoning without relying on quadratic attention mechanisms. In summary, this work extends the Spectral NSR framework with modular, semantically grounded preprocessing steps that improve graph quality without altering the core spectral reasoning engine.

Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a key solution for achieving this convergence, offering joint utilization of spectral, hardware, and computing resources. However, realizing high-performance ISAC remains challenging due to environmental line-of-sight (LoS) blockage, limited spatial resolution, and the inherent coverage asymmetry and resource coupling between sensing and communication. Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs), featuring low-cost, energy-efficient, and programmable electromagnetic reconfiguration, provide a promising solution to overcome these limitations. This article presents a comprehensive overview of IRS-aided wireless sensing and ISAC technologies, including IRS architectures, target detection and estimation techniques, beamforming designs, and performance metrics.

Traditional manual analysis approach is time-consuming and limited by human errors. To enhance efficiency and accuracy, large language models (LLMs) with strong analytical and inferencing capabilities can be employed. However, high-quality analysis reports with well-structured formatting cannot be obtained through a single instruction input to the LLM. To tackle this issue, we propose a method that first decomposes the complex task into several sub-tasks and designs effective system prompts and user prompts for each sub-task. Multi-round interactions with the LLM incorporating self-check and reflection are then conducted to enable structured data extraction as well as multi-step analysis and evaluation. Furthermore, custom tools are defined and invoked to generate figures and compute metrics. We also design multiple report templates, each tailored to a specific application and input data type, ensuring their adaptability across a variety of scenarios. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that the reports generated by our method exhibit higher quality, therefore obtaining higher scores than the baseline method.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u548c\u6a21\u677f\u751f\u6210\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u519b\u4e8b\u6a21\u62df\u63a8\u6f14\u5206\u6790\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u624b\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u6613\u51fa\u9519\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5206\u6790\u519b\u4e8b\u6a21\u62df\u63a8\u6f14\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u8f6eLLM\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08\u542b\u81ea\u68c0\u548c\u53cd\u601d\uff09\u3001\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u8c03\u7528\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u8868\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6307\u6807\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u79cd\u62a5\u544a\u6a21\u677f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u62a5\u544a\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u5f97\u5206\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u519b\u4e8b\u6a21\u62df\u63a8\u6f14\u5206\u6790\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

While recent work shows that parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA and AdaptFormer preserve tail-class performance on foundation models such as CLIP, we find that they do so at the cost of head-class accuracy. We identify the head-tail ratio, the proportion of head to tail classes, as a crucial but overlooked factor influencing this trade-off. Through controlled experiments on CIFAR100 with varying imbalance ratio ($\u03c1$) and head-tail ratio ($\u03b7$), we show that PEFT excels in tail-heavy scenarios but degrades in more balanced and head-heavy distributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose LT-Soups, a two-stage model soups framework designed to generalize across diverse LT regimes. In the first stage, LT-Soups averages models fine-tuned on balanced subsets to reduce head-class bias; in the second, it fine-tunes only the classifier on the full dataset to restore head-class accuracy.

However, recent findings reveal that in certain refractory complex concentrated alloys, edge dislocations can instead control strength. This work integrates high-temperature mechanical testing, in-situ neutron scattering during heating and tension, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations to uncover the mechanism behind this behavior. In the Nb-Ta-Ti-V system, increasing the V content, due to its smaller atomic size, induces substantial atomic misfit that raises the glide barrier for edge dislocations relative to screw dislocations. This effect drives a gradual transition from screw to edge dislocation-controlled deformation, leading to markedly enhanced strength at elevated temperatures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fb9\u4f4d\u9519\u800c\u975e\u87ba\u4f4d\u9519\u63a7\u5236\u7740\u67d0\u4e9b\u96be\u7194\u590d\u6742\u9ad8\u71b5\u5408\u91d1\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728Nb-Ti-V\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0V\u542b\u91cf\u5f97\u5230\u8bc1\u5b9e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u9ad8\u6e29\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u8fb9\u4f4d\u9519\u800c\u975e\u87ba\u4f4d\u9519\u63a7\u5236\u67d0\u4e9b\u96be\u7194\u5408\u91d1\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76V\u542b\u91cf\u5bf9Nb-Ti-V\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u6e29\u529b\u5b66\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u52a0\u70ed\u548c\u62c9\u4f38\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u539f\u4f4d\u4e2d\u5b50\u6563\u5c04\u3001\u626b\u63cf\u900f\u5c04\u7535\u5b50\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7814\u7a76Nb-Ti-V\u5408\u91d1\u3002", "result": "\u5728Nb-Ti-V\u5408\u91d1\u4e2d\uff0c\u589e\u52a0V\u542b\u91cf\u4f1a\u56e0\u539f\u5b50\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5dee\u5f02\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u663e\u8457\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u5931\u914d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fb9\u4f4d\u9519\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u87ba\u4f4d\u9519\u7684\u6ed1\u79fb\u52bf\u5792\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6548\u5e94\u5bfc\u81f4\u53d8\u5f62\u673a\u5236\u4ece\u87ba\u4f4d\u9519\u63a7\u5236\u9010\u6e10\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u8fb9\u4f4d\u9519\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u9ad8\u6e29\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728Nb-Ti-V\u5408\u91d1\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0V\u542b\u91cf\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fb9\u4f4d\u9519\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u87ba\u4f4d\u9519\u7684\u6ed1\u79fb\u52bf\u5792\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u87ba\u4f4d\u9519\u63a7\u5236\u5230\u8fb9\u4f4d\u9519\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u9ad8\u6e29\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002"}}

This paper introduces HPCAgentTester, a novel multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) framework designed to automate and enhance unit test generation for HPC software utilizing OpenMP and MPI. HPCAgentTester employs a unique collaborative workflow where specialized LLM agents (Recipe Agent and Test Agent) iteratively generate and refine test cases through a critique loop. This architecture enables the generation of context-aware unit tests that specifically target parallel execution constructs, complex communication patterns, and hierarchical parallelism. We demonstrate HPCAgentTester's ability to produce compilable and functionally correct tests for OpenMP and MPI primitives, effectively identifying subtle bugs that are often missed by conventional techniques.

This work describes a unique spatiotemporally resolved data set of U.S. electricity costs and emissions and applies time series approximation methods to quantify the alignment of electricity cost and emission incentives for large commercial and industrial consumers. We present a comprehensive spatiotemporal dataset of U.S. price-based demand response (i.e., tariff) and incentive-based demand response (IBDR) programs, enabling direct comparison to previously published marginal emission factor (MEF), average emission factor (AEF), and day-ahead market (DAM) prices. We resolved the structural incompatibility and fragmentation of these datasets by developing time series approximations of discrete data and unifying geospatially heterogeneous datasets. Analysis of these datasets reveals significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity in cost and carbon emissions incentives for demand-side energy flexibility, underscoring the importance of site selection as a key factor influencing power costs and scope 2 emissions. Analysis also reveals broad misalignment of economic and emissions incentives under existing electricity tariff structures, meaning tariffs are incentivizing consumption of more carbon-intensive electricity, and highlighting potential barriers to electrification delivering carbon savings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u5546\u4e1a\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u7528\u7535\u91cf\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4f46\u6210\u672c\u548c\u8303\u56f42\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u7684\u542b\u4e49\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u5546\u4e1a\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u7528\u7535\u6210\u672c\u548c\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u6fc0\u52b1\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793a\u7f8e\u56fd\u5546\u4e1a\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u7528\u7535\u589e\u957f\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6210\u672c\u548c\u8303\u56f42\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u6210\u672c\u548c\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u6fc0\u52b1\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u4ef7\u683c\u578b\u9700\u6c42\u54cd\u5e94\uff08\u5173\u7a0e\uff09\u548c\u6fc0\u52b1\u578b\u9700\u6c42\u54cd\u5e94\uff08IBDR\uff09\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5df2\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u6392\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\uff08MEF\uff09\u3001\u5e73\u5747\u6392\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\uff08AEF\uff09\u548c\u65e5\u524d\u5e02\u573a\uff08DAM\uff09\u4ef7\u683c\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u8fd1\u4f3c\u548c\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u548c\u788e\u7247\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7528\u7535\u6210\u672c\u548c\u8303\u56f42\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u6fc0\u52b1\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u573a\u5730\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u5f71\u54cd\u7535\u529b\u6210\u672c\u548c\u8303\u56f42\u6392\u653e\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7535\u529b\u5173\u7a0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u6fc0\u52b1\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u963b\u788d\u7535\u6c14\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u78b3\u51cf\u6392\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6210\u672c\u548c\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u6fc0\u52b1\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u573a\u5730\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u5728\u63a8\u8fdb\u7535\u6c14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5173\u7a0e\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9884\u671f\u7684\u78b3\u51cf\u6392\u6548\u76ca\u3002"}}

While effective GUI agents synergistically integrate planning and grounding capabilities, current methodologies exhibit two fundamental limitations: (1) insufficient exploitation of cross-model synergies, and (2) over-reliance on synthetic data generation without sufficient utilization. To address these challenges, we propose Co-EPG, a self-iterative training framework for Co-Evolution of Planning and Grounding. Co-EPG establishes an iterative positive feedback loop: through this loop, the planning model explores superior strategies under grounding-based reward guidance via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), generating diverse data to optimize the grounding model. Concurrently, the optimized Grounding model provides more effective rewards for subsequent GRPO training of the planning model, fostering continuous improvement. Co-EPG thus enables iterative enhancement of agent capabilities through self-play optimization and training data distillation. On the Multimodal-Mind2Web and AndroidControl benchmarks, our framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods after just three iterations without requiring external data. The agent consistently improves with each iteration, demonstrating robust self-enhancement capabilities.

Specifically, given as input an integer vector $\\vec{x} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$ and a constant-size coefficient set $C \\subset \\mathbb{Z}$, we seek a nonzero solution vector $\\vec{c} \\in C^n$ satisfying $\\vec{c} \\cdot \\vec{x} = 0$.\n  For $C = \\{-d,\\ldots,d\\}$, $d > 1$ and $C = \\{-d,\\ldots,d\\}\\setminus\\{0\\}$, $d > 2$, we present algorithms that run in time $O(|C|^{(0.5 - \u03b5)n})$ for a constant $\u03b5> 0$ that depends only on $C$. These are the first algorithms that break the $O(|C|^{n/2})$-time ``Meet-in-the-Middle barrier'' for these coefficient sets in the worst case. This improves on the result of Chen, Jin, Randolph and Servedio (SODA 2022), who broke the Meet-in-the-Middle barrier on these coefficient sets in the average-case setting. We also improve the best exact algorithm for Equal Subset Sum (Subset Balancing with $C = \\{-1,0,1\\}$), due to Mucha, Nederlof, Pawlewicz, and W\u0119grzycki (ESA 2019), by an exponential margin. This positively answers an open question of Jin, Williams, and Zhang (ESA 2025). Our results leave two natural cases in which we cannot yet break the Meet-in-the-Middle barrier: $C = \\{-2, -1, 1, 2\\}$ and $C = \\{-1, 1\\}$ (Partition).\n  Our results bring the representation technique of Howgrave-Graham and Joux (CRYPTO 2010) from average-case to worst-case inputs for many $C$. This requires a variety of new techniques: we present strategies for (1) achieving good ``mixing'' with worst-case inputs, (2) creating flexible input representations for coefficient sets without 0, and (3) quickly recovering compatible solution pairs from sets of vectors containing ``pseudosolution pairs''. These techniques may find application to other algorithmic problems on integer sums or be of independent interest.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u5b50\u96c6\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u6cdb\u5316\u4e86\u5b50\u96c6\u548c\u3001\u5212\u5206\u548c\u7b49\u5b50\u96c6\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5b50\u96c6\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u6cdb\u5316\u4e86\u5b50\u96c6\u548c\u3001\u5212\u5206\u548c\u7b49\u5b50\u96c6\u548c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e $C = \\{-d,\\ldots,d\\}$, $d > 1$ \u548c $C = \\{-d,\\ldots,d\\}\\setminus\\{0\\}$, $d > 2$ \u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u6253\u7834\u4e86 Meet-in-the-Middle \u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u969c\u788d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408 Howgrave-Graham \u548c Joux \u7684\u8868\u793a\u6280\u672f\u4e0e\u65b0\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5b9e\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u7684\u201c\u6df7\u5408\u201d\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u521b\u5efa\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u8868\u793a\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ece\u5305\u542b\u201c\u4f2a\u89e3\u5bf9\u201d\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u96c6\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u89e3\u5bf9\uff0c\u6765\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e $C = \\{-d,\\ldots,d\\}$, $d > 1$ \u548c $C = \\{-d,\\ldots,d\\}\\setminus\\{0\\}$, $d > 2$\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a $O(|C|^{(0.5 - \u03b5)n})$\uff0c\u8fd9\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6240\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6253\u7834\u4e86 Meet-in-the-Middle \u969c\u788d\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7b49\u5b50\u96c6\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86 Jin \u7b49\u4eba\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5b50\u96c6\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u65b0\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6253\u7834\u4e86 Meet-in-the-Middle \u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7b49\u5b50\u96c6\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u6574\u6570\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u53ca\u72ec\u7acb\u7b97\u6cd5\u95ee\u9898\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Each party selects a nominee before the election, and the winner is chosen from the nominated candidates based on the voters' preferences. We introduce a new restriction on these preferences, which we call party-aligned single-peakedness: all voters agree on a common ordering of the parties along an ideological axis, but may differ in their perceptions of the positions of individual candidates within each party. The preferences of each voter are single-peaked with respect to their own axis over the candidates, which is consistent with the global ordering of the parties. We present a polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing whether a preference profile satisfies party-aligned single-peakedness. In this domain, we give polynomial-time algorithms for deciding whether a given party can become the winner under some (or all) nominations, and whether this can occur in some pure Nash equilibrium. We also prove a tight result about the guaranteed existence of pure strategy Nash equilibria for elections with up to three parties for single-peaked and party-aligned single-peaked preference profiles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u653f\u515a\u5728\u6295\u7968\u9009\u4e3e\u4e2d\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u63d0\u540d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u504f\u597d\u9650\u5236\uff08\u515a\u6d3e\u4e00\u81f4\u5355\u5cf0\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u653f\u515a\u5728\u6295\u7968\u9009\u4e3e\u4e2d\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u63d0\u540d\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u515a\u6d3e\u4e00\u81f4\u5355\u5cf0\u6027\u504f\u597d\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u515a\u6d3e\u4e00\u81f4\u5355\u5cf0\u6027\u504f\u597d\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u8be5\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5224\u65ad\u7ed9\u5b9a\u653f\u515a\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6216\u6240\u6709\u63d0\u540d\u4e0b\u83b7\u80dc\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u7eaf\u6218\u7565\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u4e0b\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u80fd\u83b7\u80dc\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u6700\u591a\u4e09\u4e2a\u653f\u515a\u7684\u5355\u5cf0\u548c\u515a\u6d3e\u4e00\u81f4\u5355\u5cf0\u504f\u597d\u5206\u5e03\u56fe\u4e2d\u7eaf\u6218\u7565\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u8bc6\u522b\u515a\u6d3e\u4e00\u81f4\u5355\u5cf0\u6027\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5728\u515a\u6d3e\u4e00\u81f4\u5355\u5cf0\u6027\u504f\u597d\u4e0b\uff0c\u5224\u65ad\u653f\u515a\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6216\u6240\u6709\u63d0\u540d\u4e0b\u83b7\u80dc\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u7eaf\u6218\u7565\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u4e0b\u83b7\u80dc\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u6700\u591a\u4e09\u4e2a\u653f\u515a\u7684\u5355\u5cf0\u548c\u515a\u6d3e\u4e00\u81f4\u5355\u5cf0\u504f\u597d\u5206\u5e03\u56fe\u4e2d\u7eaf\u6218\u7565\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u515a\u6d3e\u4e00\u81f4\u5355\u5cf0\u6027\u504f\u597d\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0e\u653f\u515a\u63d0\u540d\u548c\u9009\u4e3e\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6700\u591a\u4e09\u4e2a\u653f\u515a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u7eaf\u6218\u7565\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u662f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u3002"}}

Code available at https://github.com/microsoft/SafeAgents", "summary": "LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems (MAS). As these systems move toward real-world applications, their security becomes paramount. Existing research largely evaluates single-agent security, leaving a critical gap in understanding the vulnerabilities introduced by multi-agent design. However, existing systems fall short due to lack of unified frameworks and metrics focusing on unique rejection modes in MAS. We present SafeAgents, a unified and extensible framework for fine-grained security assessment of MAS. SafeAgents systematically exposes how design choices such as plan construction strategies, inter-agent context sharing, and fallback behaviors affect susceptibility to adversarial prompting. We introduce Dharma, a diagnostic measure that helps identify weak links within multi-agent pipelines. Using SafeAgents, we conduct a comprehensive study across five widely adopted multi-agent architectures (centralized, decentralized, and hybrid variants) on four datasets spanning web tasks, tool use, and code generation. Our findings reveal that common design patterns carry significant vulnerabilities. For example, centralized systems that delegate only atomic instructions to sub-agents obscure harmful objectives, reducing robustness. Our results highlight the need for security-aware design in MAS.

Our results show that inter-qubit coupling and energy splitting epsilon significantly influence the dynamics, producing pronounced oscillations in the weak-coupling regime and protecting pre-existing entanglement in the strong-coupling regime. NG is the most sensitive, QD persists longer revealing nonclassical correlations independent of entanglement, and QM-EUR reflects residual quantum memory and entropic uncertainty, showing that quantum signatures survive even when NG and QD are weak. Pulse amplitude and width effectively control the generation and dissipation of correlations, while the intensity of pulse-induced dephasing modulates the balance between sustained oscillations and rapid decoherence. The initial state also plays a crucial role: a partially entangled initial state is more resilient to perturbations, preserving correlations over time, whereas a separable state exhibits cycles of entanglement creation and destruction. Thus, by adjusting system parameters, it is possible to control the stability and lifetime of correlations and coherence, providing a framework to optimize quantum systems for applications requiring both strong entanglement and long-lasting coherence, such as quantum computing and secure communication.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cf\u5b50\u5173\u8054\uff08\u8d1f\u5ea6\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u6563\u5ea6\u3001\u91cf\u5b50-\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8f85\u52a9\u71b5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\u5728\u53d7\u5916\u90e8\u8109\u51b2\u548c\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u53cc\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8026\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u88c2\u3001\u8109\u51b2\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u5173\u8054\u5728\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5916\u90e8\u8109\u51b2\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u901a\u4fe1\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u632f\u5e45\u963b\u5c3c\u3001\u7eaf\u7cb9\u9000\u76f8\u3001\u8109\u51b2\u8bf1\u5bfc\u9000\u76f8\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u4fe1\u9053\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u8026\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u88c2\u548c\u8109\u51b2\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u53cc\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8d1f\u5ea6\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u6563\u5ea6\u548c\u91cf\u5b50-\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8f85\u52a9\u71b5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "result": "\u8d1f\u5ea6\u6700\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u6563\u5ea6\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u957f\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50-\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8f85\u52a9\u71b5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u6b8b\u4f59\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u71b5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u91cf\u5b50\u5173\u8054\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53d7\u8026\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u88c2\u3001\u8109\u51b2\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u8d1f\u5ea6\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u6563\u5ea6\u548c\u91cf\u5b50-\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8f85\u52a9\u71b5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u8d1f\u5ea6\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6563\u5ea6\u8f83\u5f31\u65f6\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u5f81\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b58\u6d3b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u91cf\u5b50\u5173\u8054\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5bff\u547d\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u9700\u8981\u5f3a\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u957f\u4e45\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u901a\u4fe1\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Unlike traditional methods, which synthesize one logical controller over a given detailed plant model, USC synthesis constructs a \\emph{generic controller} whose outputs are conditioned by plant behavior, called \\emph{prophecies}. Thereby, USCs offer strong generalization and scalability benefits over classical logical controllers. However, the exact computation and verification of prophecies remain computationally challenging. In this paper, we introduce an approximation algorithm for USC synthesis that addresses these limitations via learning. Instead of computing exact prophecies, which reason about sets of trees via automata, we only compute under- and over-approximations from (small) example plants and infer computation tree logic (CTL) formulas as representations of prophecies. The resulting USC generalizes to unseen plants via a verification step and offers improved efficiency and explainability through small and concise CTL prophecies, which remain human-readable and interpretable. Experimental results demonstrate that our learned prophecies remain generalizable, yet are significantly more compact and interpretable than their exact tree automata representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "USC\u7684\u5408\u6210\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5176\u9884\u8a00\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "USC\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u5de5\u5382\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u90fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5b89\u5168\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u4f46\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9884\u8a00\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u4ecd\u7136\u5f88\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u5c0f\u7684\uff09\u793a\u4f8b\u5de5\u5382\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u6811\u903b\u8f91\uff08CTL\uff09\u516c\u5f0f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u8a00\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u9884\u8a00\u3002", "result": "\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684USC\u901a\u8fc7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6b65\u9aa4\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u770b\u4e0d\u89c1\u7684\u5de5\u5382\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u7684\u3001\u7b80\u6d01\u7684CTL\u9884\u8a00\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9884\u8a00\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u8bfb\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u9884\u8a00\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u6bd4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6811\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u8868\u793a\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

To support them, current devices are adopting SoCs (System on Chip) with NPUs (Neural Processing Unit) installed. Although high performance is expected, LLM inference on NPUs is slower than its CPU counterpart. The reason is that NPUs have poor performance on computations other than GEMM, like dequantization. Current works either disaggregate prefill on the NPUs and decoding on the CPUs, or put both on the NPUs but with an accuracy loss. To solve this issue, based on the insight that low-bit can enable target computation encoded within an acceptably sized table, we propose table lookup to subsume hardware operations otherwise unsupported. To realize this, we overcome the conflicting hardware behavior of prefill and decoding to design a unified table layout and tiling through (1) fused two-level table-based dequantization and (2) concurrency-hierarchy-guided tiling. Based on that, we implement the prefill phase by three-stage pipeline and map the table-lookup-based decoding to NPU's vector units. Results show 1.4x and 3.1x speedup for prefill and decoding respectively, and 84% energy savings compared to the baseline NPU methods.

In this paper, we propose a data-driven computational framework for coupled opinion-adoption dynamics in social systems. Each node in the multilayer network represents a community characterized by a specific age group and mobility level, derived from large-scale survey data on the predisposition to adopt electric vehicles in Northern Europe. The proposed model captures three mechanisms: behavioral contagion through social and informational diffusion, abandonment driven by dissatisfaction, and feedback between opinions and adoption levels through social influence. Analyzing the equilibrium points of the coupled system allows us to derive the conditions that enable large-scale adoption. We empirically calibrate the model using data to construct synthetic populations and social similarity networks, which we use to explore targeted interventions that promote sustainable transitions. Specifically, the analysis focuses on two types of control strategies: opinion-based policies, which act on the social network layer, and policies that aim to improve experience and reduce dissatisfaction. Simulation results show that the latter ensure more stable and long-term adoption, offering concrete insights for designing effective interventions in sociotechnical transitions toward sustainability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u5982\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u793e\u4f1a\u4e2d\u4f20\u64ad\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u884c\u4e3a\u4f20\u67d3\u3001\u56e0\u4e0d\u6ee1\u800c\u653e\u5f03\u4ee5\u53ca\u610f\u89c1\u548c\u91c7\u7eb3\u6c34\u5e73\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91c7\u7eb3\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6821\u51c6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u610f\u89c1\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6539\u5584\u4f53\u9a8c\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u6ee1\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u540e\u8005\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u957f\u671f\u7684\u91c7\u7eb3\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a8\u52a8\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u8f6c\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u7406\u89e3\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u5982\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u793e\u4f1a\u4e2d\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6574\u5408\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u6a21\u62df\u8026\u5408\u7684\u610f\u89c1\u91c7\u7eb3\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u7f51\u7edc\u8282\u70b9\u4ee3\u8868\u6839\u636e\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u91c7\u7eb3\u503e\u5411\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u5e74\u9f84\u7ec4\u548c\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u793e\u533a\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5305\u542b\u884c\u4e3a\u4f20\u67d3\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u6269\u6563\uff09\u3001\u56e0\u4e0d\u6ee1\u800c\u653e\u5f03\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u610f\u89c1\u548c\u91c7\u7eb3\u6c34\u5e73\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u70b9\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91c7\u7eb3\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5229\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6821\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5408\u6210\u4eba\u7fa4\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u610f\u89c1\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u4f5c\u7528\u4e8e\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u5c42\uff09\u548c\u65e8\u5728\u6539\u5584\u4f53\u9a8c\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u6ee1\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4f53\u9a8c\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u6ee1\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u786e\u4fdd\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u66f4\u957f\u671f\u7684\u91c7\u7eb3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65e8\u5728\u6539\u5584\u4f53\u9a8c\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u6ee1\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\u6bd4\u5355\u7eaf\u57fa\u4e8e\u610f\u89c1\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u80fd\u786e\u4fdd\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u957f\u671f\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u884c\u4e3a\u91c7\u7eb3\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u8f6c\u578b\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

In many scenarios, such as Maritime SAR, expected survival times are short and optimal search could increase the likelihood of success. This optimization problem is complex for nontrivial problems given its probabilistic nature.\n  Stochastic optimization methods search large problems by nondeterministically sampling the space to reduce the effective size of the problem. This has been used in SAR planning to search otherwise intractably large problems but the stochastic nature provides no formal guarantees on the quality of solutions found in finite time.\n  This paper instead presents $\\rm{A}^{\\rm{SAR}}$, an $\\varepsilon$-optimal search algorithm for SAR planning. It calculates a heuristic to bound the search space and uses graph-search methods to find solutions that are formally guaranteed to be within a user-specified factor, $\\varepsilon$, of the optimal solution. It finds better solutions faster than existing optimization approaches in operational simulations.

The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) improved the quality of photorealistic image generation. Diffusion models later brought a new era of generative media. These advances made it difficult to separate real and synthetic content. The rise of deepfakes demonstrated how these tools could be misused to spread misinformation, political conspiracies, privacy violations, and fraud. For this reason, many detection models have been developed. They often use deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). These models search for visual, spatial, or temporal anomalies. However, such approaches often fail to generalize across unseen data and struggle with content from different models. In addition, existing approaches are ineffective in multimodal data and highly modified content. This study reviews twenty-four recent works on AI-generated media detection. Each study was examined individually to identify its contributions and weaknesses, respectively. The review then summarizes the common limitations and key challenges faced by current approaches. Based on this analysis, a research direction is suggested with a focus on multimodal deep learning models. Such models have the potential to provide more robust and generalized detection.

While existing works on MA systems have demonstrated performance gains over conventional systems, they often neglect the design of specialized codebooks to leverage MA's unique capabilities and address the challenges of increased energy consumption and latency inherent to MA systems. To address these aspects, we first integrate blockage detection into the codebook design process based on the Gerchberg-Saxton (GS) algorithm, significantly reducing inefficiencies due to beam evaluations done in blocked directions. Then, we use a two-stage approach to reduce the complexity of the joint beamforming and Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) optimization problem. The simulations demonstrate that the proposed adaptive codebook successfully improves the Energy Efficiency (EE) and reduces the beam training overhead, substantially boosting the practical deployment potential of RIS-assisted MA systems in future wireless networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\uff08mm-Wave\uff09\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u5929\u7ebf\uff08MA\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8003\u8651\u906e\u6321\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5206\u5c42\u6ce2\u675f\u5f62\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u906e\u6321\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u57fa\u4e8eGerchberg-Saxton\uff08GS\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u7801\u672c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u6ce2\u675f\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u9762\uff08RIS\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u80fd\u6548\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6ce2\u675f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86RIS\u8f85\u52a9MA\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u672a\u6765\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MA\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e13\u95e8\u7801\u672c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6765\u5229\u7528MA\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3MA\u7cfb\u7edf\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "1. \u57fa\u4e8eGerchberg-Saxton\uff08GS\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c06\u906e\u6321\u68c0\u6d4b\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u7801\u672c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5728\u906e\u6321\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u95ee\u9898\u3002 2. \u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u8054\u5408\u6ce2\u675f\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u9762\uff08RIS\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7801\u672c\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\uff08EE\uff09\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6ce2\u675f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86RIS\u8f85\u52a9MA\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u672a\u6765\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u906e\u6321\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5c42\u6ce2\u675f\u5f62\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347RIS\u8f85\u52a9MA\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u5728\u672a\u6765\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We present an architecture that resolves this tension through offline data augmentation and efficient parallel retrieval from structured episodic memory. Our system transforms biographical data into 1,774 enriched first-person memories with affective-semantic metadata, then employs two-stage retrieval achieving 0.52s prompt generation. Evaluation using LLM-as-judge and RAGAs metrics shows our approach achieves parity with traditional RAG on GPT-4 while significantly outperforming it on smaller models (GPT-3.5, GPT-3), suggesting particular value for resource-constrained deployments. Beyond dialogue, the structured memory enables novel visualization tools: spatiotemporal heatmaps, emotional trajectory analysis, and interactive path tracking, positioning the system as both a dialogue interface and research tool for biographical analysis.

Otsuji", "M. S. Shur"], "title": "Effect of doping on hot-carrier thermal breakdown in perforated graphene metasurfaces", "comment": "7 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "We examine the robustness of the S-shaped current-voltage characteristics associated with hot-carrier-induced electrical breakdown in perforated graphene metasurfaces (PGMs) as a function of doping. The perforation of the graphene layer forms interdigital arrays of graphene microribbons (GMRs) interconnected by graphene nanoribbon (GNR) bridges. These GNR constrictions act as energy barriers for electrons and holes emitted from the GMRs and govern the inter-GMR thermionic current under an applied bias voltage. The doping and the voltage bias establish distinct electron and hole populations in adjacent GMRs. Peltier heating of these carriers within the GMRs increases their effective temperatures, thereby enhancing the inter-GMR current. The resulting positive feedback between carrier heating and current amplification can trigger an electrothermal breakdown, transforming a superlinear current-voltage dependence into an S-shaped characteristic exhibiting negative differential resistance. The degree of electron-hole asymmetry significantly influences this positive feedback and strongly modifies the overall current-voltage response.

Although sparse regression techniques have advanced system identification, they struggle with rational functions and noise sensitivity in complex mechanical systems. The Lagrangian formalism offers a promising alternative, as it typically avoids rational expressions and provides a more concise representation of system dynamics. However, existing Lagrangian identification methods are significantly affected by measurement noise and limited data availability. This paper presents a novel differentiable sparse identification framework that addresses these limitations through three key contributions: (1) the first integration of cubic B-Spline approximation into Lagrangian system identification, enabling accurate representation of complex nonlinearities, (2) a robust equation discovery mechanism that effectively utilizes measurements while incorporating known physical constraints, (3) a recursive derivative computation scheme based on B-spline basis functions, effectively constraining higher-order derivatives and reducing noise sensitivity on second-order dynamical systems. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance and enables more accurate and reliable extraction of physical laws from noisy data, particularly in complex mechanical systems compared to baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7a00\u758f\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6709\u7406\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u590d\u6742\u673a\u68b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e3b\u4e49\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6613\u53d7\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7a00\u758f\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u4e09\u6b21B\u6837\u6761\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u65b9\u7a0b\u53d1\u73b0\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5229\u7528\u6d4b\u91cf\u503c\u548c\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8eB\u6837\u6761\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u5fae\u5206\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u7ea6\u675f\u9ad8\u9636\u5bfc\u6570\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5f8b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u52a0\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7a00\u758f\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210B\u6837\u6761\u8fd1\u4f3c\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ece\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5f8b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

The TaskConstellation continuously evolves as results stream in from distributed devices, enabling asynchronous execution, adaptive recovery, and dynamic optimization. A Constellation Orchestrator} executes tasks safely and asynchronously while applying dynamic DAG updates, and the Agent Interaction Protocol (AIP) provides persistent, low-latency channels for reliable task dispatch and result streaming. These designs dissolve the traditional boundaries between devices and platforms, allowing agents to collaborate seamlessly and amplify their collective intelligence.\n  We evaluate UFO$^3$ on NebulaBench, a benchmark of 55 cross-device tasks across 5 machines and 10 categories. UFO$^3$ achieves 83.3% subtask completion, 70.9% task success, exposes parallelism with an average width of 1.72, and reduces end-to-end latency by 31% relative to a sequential baseline.

Key to this approach is the map representation, which is constructed with conjugate priors to the measurement likelihoods and defined in the same path coordinates as the vehicle controller, such that the map can be externalized to provide a local representation of the parameter likelihoods that vary in space. The result is a spatial map of vehicle parameters adapted online to enhance the driving control system. We provide theoretical guarantees on the smoothness of relevant parameter likelihood statistics as a function of space, which is critical for their use in predictive control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5373\u65f6\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u77e9\u5339\u914d\u66f4\u65b0\u6982\u7387\u56fe\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7a7a\u95f4\u53c2\u6570\u56fe\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u9a7e\u9a76\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u9a7e\u9a76\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5229\u7528\u5373\u65f6\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7ed3\u5408\u76f8\u673a\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u77e9\u5339\u914d\u66f4\u65b0\u6982\u7387\u56fe\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u8f66\u8f86\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5373\u65f6\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u6982\u7387\u56fe\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5171\u8f6d\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u5ea6\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u5728\u7ebf\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u56fe\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u9a7e\u9a76\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u5e76\u4e14\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u5ea6\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u5728\u7ebf\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

To reduce the cognitive load on the decision maker, previous work has introduced the Pareto pruning problem, where the goal is to compute a fixed-size subset of Pareto optimal solutions that best represent the full set, as evaluated by a given quality measure. Reframing Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, we conduct an axiomatic analysis of existing quality measures, uncovering several unintuitive behaviors. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a new measure, directed coverage. We also analyze the computational complexity of optimizing various quality measures, identifying previously unknown boundaries between tractable and intractable cases depending on the number and structure of the objectives.

In this paper, we propose a new strategy with the potential to overcome the $3/2$ barrier. In doing so we are led to a number-theoretic conjecture, one form of which is that there are sets $S, T$ of cardinality $n^\u03b2$, consisting of positive integers of magnitude at most $\\exp(n^\u03b1)$, such that every integer $i \\in [n]$ divides $s-t$ for some $s \\in S, t \\in T$. Achieving $\u03b1+ \u03b2\\le 1 + o(1)$ is trivial; we show that achieving $\u03b1, \u03b2< 1/2$ (together with an assumption that $S, T$ are structured) implies an improvement to the exponent 3/2 for univariate polynomial factorization. Achieving $\u03b1= \u03b2= 1/3$ is best-possible and would imply an exponent 4/3 algorithm for univariate polynomial factorization.

The happy nucleolus applies the same fairness criterion as the well-established nucleolus but with reduced total value.

This refutes conjectures of Meir, Rosenschein and Malizia (2011).\n  Further, we study the separation problem of the linear programs appearing in the MPS scheme for computing the (happy) nucleolus. It includes linear subspace avoidance constraints, which can be handled efficiently for problems with a certain dynamic programming formulation due to K\u00f6hnemann and Toth (2020). We show how to get rid of these constraints for all monotone games if we allow for an arbitrarily small error of epsilon, thus conserving known approximation guarantees for the same problem without subspace avoidance.\n  Finally, we focus on practical results at the example of vehicle routing games by designing an efficient heuristic based on our previous insights and past work, and demonstrate its power.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5408\u4f5c\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u6210\u672c\u5206\u914d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u5206\u914d\u6982\u5ff5\u201chappy nucleolus\u201d\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76happy nucleolus\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfnucleolus\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u53cd\u9a73\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u731c\u60f3\uff1b\u7814\u7a76MPS\u65b9\u6848\u4e2d\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u907f\u514d\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f66\u8f86\u8def\u5f84\u535a\u5f08\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1. \u5206\u6790happy nucleolus\u4e0enucleolus\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3e\u4f8b\u53cd\u9a73\u76f8\u5173\u731c\u60f3\u3002 2. \u7814\u7a76MPS\u65b9\u6848\u4e2d\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7ebf\u6027\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u907f\u514d\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5904\u7406\u3002 3. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u8def\u5f84\u535a\u5f08\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "1. \u53d1\u73b0happy nucleolus\u4e0enucleolus\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4e14\u4e00\u4e9b\u76f4\u89c2\u6027\u8d28\uff08\u5982\u73a9\u5bb6\u7684\u52a0\u5165\u503c\uff09\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u53cd\u9a73\u4e86Meir, Rosenschein\u548cMalizia (2011)\u7684\u731c\u60f3\u3002 2. \u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u5355\u8c03\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5141\u8bb8epsilon\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u79fb\u9664\u7ebf\u6027\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u907f\u514d\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002 3. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u8def\u5f84\u535a\u5f08\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Happy nucleolus\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bd4\u9884\u671f\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u5176\u6c42\u89e3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u8f66\u8f86\u8def\u5f84\u535a\u5f08\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7406\u8bba\u3002"}}

However, true personalization requires adapting to learners' complex knowledge states (multi-source) and diverse goals (multi-sink); existing ITSs often lack the necessary structural-reasoning capability and knowledge dynamism to generate genuinely effective learning paths, and they lack scientifically rigorous validation paradigms. In this paper we propose GraphMASAL (A Graph-based Multi-Agent System for Adaptive Learning), which integrates (i) a dynamic knowledge graph for persistent, stateful learner modeling; (ii) a LangGraph-orchestrated trio of agents (Diagnostician, Planner, Tutor); (iii) a knowledge-graph-grounded two-stage neural IR component (dual-encoder dense retrieval with cross-encoder listwise re-ranking and calibrated score fusion); and (iv) a multi-source multi-sink (MSMS) planning engine with a cognitively grounded cost and an approximation guarantee via greedy set cover. Under blinded automated evaluations with matched inputs and inference settings across diverse student profiles, GraphMASAL consistently outperforms LLM prompting and structured ablations in planning--achieving stronger structural/sequence alignment of learning paths, higher coverage of weak concepts, and lower learning cost--while also surpassing prompt-based baselines in cognitive diagnosis. Agreement with expert/LLM-proxy ratings further supports the validity of our evaluation protocol. These findings indicate that grounding LLM agents in a dynamic knowledge graph, coupled with optimization under educational constraints, yields reliable, interpretable, and pedagogically plausible learning plans, advancing personalized and goal-oriented education.", "AI": {"tldr": "GraphMASAL\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u3001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08ITSs\uff09\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u590d\u6742\u77e5\u8bc6\u72b6\u6001\uff08\u591a\u6e90\uff09\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u591a\u6c47\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ed3\u6784\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u548c\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGraphMASAL\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u8fdb\u884c\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LangGraph\u7f16\u6392\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u8f85\u5bfc\u4e09\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u795e\u7ecf\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u8ba4\u77e5\u6210\u672c\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u591a\u6e90\u591a\u6c47\u89c4\u5212\u5f15\u64ce\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u76f2\u6d4b\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cGraphMASAL\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8eLLM\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6d88\u51cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784/\u5e8f\u5217\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8584\u5f31\u6982\u5ff5\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u672c\u3002\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u9762\u4e5f\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u6559\u80b2\u5b66\u539f\u7406\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

For practical implementation of distributed FTQC, logical Bell pair preparation must be designed not only for efficient Bell pair consumption but also for the spacetime volume of the protocol; however, entanglement distillation protocols have primarily focused on minimizing the consumption of Bell pairs, often resulting in protocols that require a substantial number of local operations. To resolve this issue, we introduce a metric for characterizing the practical cost of preparing high-fidelity logical Bell pairs, link-limited volume (LLV), which is a circuit-volume metric incorporating both the cost of physical Bell pair consumption and the volume associated with local operations. Guided by this metric, we propose entanglement boosting protocol, which achieves efficient preparation of logical Bell pairs encoded in rotated surface code with LLV reduced by orders of magnitude compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. In this protocol, paralleling recent advances in magic state cultivation, we employ soft-information decoders and postselection to suppress the logical error rates of Bell pairs to practical levels in the order of $10^{-10}$ from fewer than 100 noisy physical Bell pairs while all local operations are implementable within a spatial region of a single surface code patch. We also present a pipelined implementation of entanglement distillation using high-rate quantum error-correcting codes, enabling arbitrarily low logical error rates while also maintaining physically efficient implementations. These results pave the way for the practical implementation of distributed FTQC, reinforcing the benefits of fast interconnect technologies and serving as a guiding principle for the efficient design of protocols and devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5bb9\u9519\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08FTQC\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u8d1d\u5c14\u6001\u5236\u5907\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u534f\u8bae\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11\u8d1d\u5c14\u6001\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u672c\u5730\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4-\u65f6\u95f4\u6210\u672c\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201c\u94fe\u8def\u6709\u9650\u4f53\u79ef\u201d\uff08LLV\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u8d1d\u5c14\u6001\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u672c\u5730\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4-\u65f6\u95f4\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u201c\u7ea0\u7f20\u589e\u5f3a\u534f\u8bae\u201d\u3002\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u4f7f\u7528\u8f6f\u4fe1\u606f\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u540e\u9009\u62e9\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u6d88\u8017\u4e0d\u5230100\u4e2a\u566a\u58f0\u7269\u7406\u8d1d\u5c14\u6001\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c06\u903b\u8f91\u8d1d\u5c14\u6001\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u5230 10^-10 \u7684\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6240\u6709\u672c\u5730\u64cd\u4f5c\u5747\u53ef\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u8868\u9762\u7801\u533a\u57df\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u901f\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u7801\u7684\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5f0f\u7ea0\u7f20\u84b8\u998f\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u610f\u4f4e\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6210\u679c\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f FTQC \u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7ea0\u7f20\u84b8\u998f\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u5236\u5907\u903b\u8f91\u8d1d\u5c14\u6001\u65f6\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u8017\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46\u5f80\u5f80\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u672c\u5730\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201c\u94fe\u8def\u6709\u9650\u4f53\u79ef\u201d\uff08LLV\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u7efc\u5408\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u8d1d\u5c14\u6001\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u672c\u5730\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4-\u65f6\u95f4\u4f53\u79ef\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u201c\u7ea0\u7f20\u589e\u5f3a\u534f\u8bae\u201d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8f6f\u4fe1\u606f\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u540e\u9009\u62e9\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u8868\u9762\u7801\u533a\u57df\u5185\u5236\u5907\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u903b\u8f91\u8d1d\u5c14\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06LLV\u503c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u901f\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u7801\u7684\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u589e\u5f3a\u534f\u8bae\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u5230100\u4e2a\u566a\u58f0\u7269\u7406\u8d1d\u5c14\u6001\uff0c\u5c06\u903b\u8f91\u8d1d\u5c14\u6001\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u81f3 10^-10 \u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u4e14\u6240\u6709\u672c\u5730\u64cd\u4f5c\u5747\u53ef\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u8868\u9762\u7801\u533a\u57df\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u3002\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u610f\u4f4e\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684LLV\u6307\u6807\u548c\u7ea0\u7f20\u589e\u5f3a\u534f\u8bae\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5bb9\u9519\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u903b\u8f91\u8d1d\u5c14\u6001\u5236\u5907\u7684\u6210\u672c\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u4e92\u8fde\u6280\u672f\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

This approach enables two-dimensional thermal mapping of the PCB under heating configurations with multiple hotspots. A spatial resolution of 3 cm and a temperature accuracy of 2 \u00b0C are achieved with an integration time of 5 minutes. Thermography can be performed down to 77 K, revealing that the PCB thermal resistance decreases by nearly an order of magnitude compared to room temperature, due to enhanced convective cooling in liquid nitrogen.

Notable examples include brain connectivity networks collected across multiple patients or trade networks between countries collected across multiple goods. Existing statistical approaches to such data typically focus on modeling the structure shared by all networks; some go further by accounting for individual, layer-specific variation. However, real-world multilayer networks often exhibit additional patterns shared only within certain subsets of layers, which can represent treatment and control groups, or patients grouped by a specific trait. Identifying these group-level structures can uncover systematic differences between groups of networks and influence many downstream tasks, such as testing and low-dimensional visualization. To address this gap, we introduce the GroupMultiNeSS model, which enables the simultaneous extraction of shared, group-specific, and individual latent structures from a sample of networks on a shared node set. For this model, we establish identifiability, develop a fitting procedure using convex optimization in combination with a nuclear norm penalty, and prove a guarantee of recovery for the latent positions as long as there is sufficient separation between the shared, group-specific, and individual latent subspaces. We compare the model with MultiNeSS and other models for multiplex networks in various synthetic scenarios and observe an apparent improvement in the modeling accuracy when the group component is accounted for. Experiment with the Parkinson's disease brain connectivity dataset demonstrates the superiority of GroupMultiNeSS in highlighting node-level insights on biological differences between the treatment and control patient groups.", "AI": {"tldr": "GroupMultiNeSS\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u591a\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5171\u4eab\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u7ec4\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u6f5c\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u8111\u8fde\u63a5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u6240\u6709\u7f51\u7edc\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6216\u4e2a\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5c42\u5b50\u96c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGroupMultiNeSS\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6838\u8303\u6570\u60e9\u7f5a\u6765\u62df\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6062\u590d\u6f5c\u5728\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0cGroupMultiNeSS\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8003\u8651\u7ec4\u522b\u6210\u5206\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002\u5728\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u8111\u8fde\u63a5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cGroupMultiNeSS\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u6cbb\u7597\u7ec4\u548c\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u4e4b\u95f4\u8282\u70b9\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u5dee\u5f02\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "conclusion": "GroupMultiNeSS\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u53d6\u5171\u4eab\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u7ec4\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u6f5c\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

Yip"], "title": "An Investigation into Dynamically Extensible and Retractable Robotic Leg Linkages for Multi-task Execution in Search and Rescue Scenarios", "comment": null, "summary": "Search and rescue (SAR) robots are required to quickly traverse terrain and perform high-force rescue tasks, necessitating both terrain adaptability and controlled high-force output. Few platforms exist today for SAR, and fewer still have the ability to cover both tasks of terrain adaptability and high-force output when performing extraction. While legged robots offer significant ability to traverse uneven terrain, they typically are unable to incorporate mechanisms that provide variable high-force outputs, unlike traditional wheel-based drive trains. This work introduces a novel concept for a dynamically extensible and retractable robot leg. Leveraging a dynamically extensible and retractable five-bar linkage design, it allows for mechanically switching between height-advantaged and force-advantaged configurations via a geometric transformation. A testbed evaluated leg performance across linkage geometries and operating modes, with empirical and analytical analyses conducted on stride length, force output, and stability.

Representation finetuning (ReFT) methods further improve efficiency by freezing model weights and optimizing internal representations with fewer parameters than PEFT, outperforming PEFT on several tasks. However, ReFT exhibits a significant performance decline on mathematical reasoning tasks. To address this problem, the paper demonstrates that ReFT's poor performance on mathematical tasks primarily stems from its struggle to generate effective reasoning prefixes during the early inference phase. Moreover, ReFT disturbs the numerical encoding and the error accumulats during the CoT stage. Based on these observations, this paper proposes Bias-REstrained Prefix Representation FineTuning (BREP ReFT), which enhances ReFT's mathematical reasoning capability by truncating training data to optimize the generation of initial reasoning prefixes, intervening on the early inference stage to prevent error accumulation, and constraining the intervention vectors' magnitude to avoid disturbing numerical encoding. Extensive experiments across diverse model architectures demonstrate BREP's superior effectiveness, efficiency, and robust generalization capability, outperforming both standard ReFT and weight-based PEFT methods on the task of mathematical reasoning.

However, real-world synthesis and functionalization processes introduce structural modifications that can compromise its mechanical integrity. Nitrogen doping, while beneficial for electronic property tuning, often results in atomic clustering rather than uniform distribution, while concurrent vacancy defect formation represents another common structural alteration during processing. This study systematically investigates the comparative effects of nitrogen atom clusters and equivalent sized vacancy defects on the mechanical behavior of graphene sheets through molecular dynamics simulations. The Nitrogen clustering significantly degraded mechanical performance almost similarly to random doping. In comparison, systems with equivalent-sized vacancy defects showed higher stiffness and lower ductility than those with clusters. The study revealed distinct failure mechanisms between doped and defective configurations, with nitrogen clusters showing modified crack propagation patterns while vacancies acted as pronounced stress concentrators, leading to premature failure. However, this study also showed that defect morphology critically influences mechanical properties. These findings provide important insights for optimizing graphene synthesis and processing protocols, highlighting the differential mechanical risks associated with dopant clustering versus vacancy formation. The results inform defect-tolerant design strategies for graphene-based nanoelectronics, composites, and sensors, where mechanical reliability is paramount for device performance and longevity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6c2e\u63ba\u6742\u548c\u7a7a\u4f4d\u7f3a\u9677\u5bf9\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u5728\u7b49\u5927\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u521a\u5ea6\u548c\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u5ef6\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u4e24\u8005\u5931\u6548\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "motivation": "\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u7684\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u5176\u5728\u5148\u8fdb\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5408\u6210\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6539\u53d8\uff08\u5982\u6c2e\u539f\u5b50\u56e2\u7c07\u548c\u7a7a\u4f4d\u7f3a\u9677\uff09\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u5176\u529b\u5b66\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u6c2e\u539f\u5b50\u56e2\u7c07\u548c\u7b49\u5927\u7a7a\u4f4d\u7f3a\u9677\u5bf9\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u6c2e\u539f\u5b50\u56e2\u7c07\u548c\u7b49\u5927\u7a7a\u4f4d\u7f3a\u9677\u5bf9\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6c2e\u56e2\u7c07\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u7684\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u63ba\u6742\u76f8\u4f3c\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u7b49\u5927\u7a7a\u4f4d\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u4f53\u7cfb\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6bd4\u56e2\u7c07\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u521a\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u5ef6\u5c55\u6027\u3002\u6c2e\u56e2\u7c07\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u88c2\u7eb9\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u7a7a\u4f4d\u5219\u4f5c\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5e94\u529b\u96c6\u4e2d\u6e90\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u65e9\u5931\u6548\u3002\u7f3a\u9677\u5f62\u6001\u5bf9\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u5173\u952e\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6c2e\u56e2\u7c07\u548c\u7a7a\u4f4d\u7f3a\u9677\u5bf9\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u5f02\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u52a0\u5de5\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8010\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u57fa\u5668\u4ef6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Computational models of DBS are widely used to investigate the effects of stimulation on neural tissue, to explore stimulation targets and sweetspots, and ultimately, to aid clinicians in the DBS programming by calculating the stimulation parameters. Commonly, DBS is performed bilaterally, i.e. with one lead in each brain hemisphere, where computational models are solved independently for one lead at a time. This paper treats scenarios where multiple DBS leads are implanted in close proximity to one another, resulting in interacting electrical fields and, therefore, potentially overlapping stimulation spreads. In particular, a global dual-lead model is compared to approximations derived from single-lead approaches in a cohort of twelve multiple sclerosis (MS) tremor patients. It is concluded that simple superposition of volumes of tissue activated (VTAs) underestimates activation, while superposition of electric fields or activating functions leads to overestimation. It is concluded that given close proximity of DBS leads, the VTA cannot be computed individually as stimulation fields exhibit significant and complex interaction.

It is even known that modern SAT solvers work efficiently on instances of small treewidth. Since these solvers are widely applied, research interests in compact encodings into (Q)SAT for solving and to understand encoding limitations. Even more general is the graph parameter clique-width, which unlike treewidth can be small for dense graphs. Although algorithms are available for clique-width, little is known about encodings. We initiate the quest to understand encoding capabilities with clique-width by considering abstract argumentation, which is a robust framework for reasoning with conflicting arguments. It is based on directed graphs and asks for computationally challenging properties, making it a natural candidate to study computational properties. We design novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT. Our reductions linearly preserve the clique-width, resulting in directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions. We establish novel results for all argumentation semantics, including counting. Notably, the overhead caused by our DDG reductions cannot be significantly improved under reasonable assumptions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u56fe\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u56e2\u5bbd\u5ea6\uff09\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u62bd\u8c61\u8bba\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7ea6\u7b80\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3SAT\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5c0f\u56e2\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5bf9\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a(Q)SAT\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u7f16\u7801\u9650\u5236\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u5174\u8da3\u3002\u56e2\u5bbd\u5ea6\u6bd4\u6811\u5bbd\u5ea6\u66f4\u901a\u7528\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7a20\u5bc6\u56fe\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5176\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u56e2\u5bbd\u5ea6\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4ece\u8bba\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\u5230(Q)SAT\u7684\u65b0\u7ea6\u7b80\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u201c\u5b9a\u5411\u5206\u89e3\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08DDG\uff09\u201d\u7ea6\u7b80\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u7ea6\u7b80\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u7ebf\u6027\u5730\u4fdd\u6301\u56e2\u5bbd\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "DDG\u7ea6\u7b80\u65b9\u6cd5\u88ab\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u8bba\u8bc1\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8ba1\u6570\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u65b0\u6210\u679c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u7406\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0cDDG\u7ea6\u7b80\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u989d\u5916\u5f00\u9500\u65e0\u6cd5\u88ab\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684DDG\u7ea6\u7b80\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u7ebf\u6027\u4fdd\u6301\u56e2\u5bbd\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u56e2\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u80fd\u529b\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u62bd\u8c61\u8bba\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7ea6\u7b80\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5f00\u9500\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This quantity, though less studied than total weight or length, plays a critical role in quantum fault tolerance because it directly impacts the overhead of lattice surgery procedures used to implement an almost universal quantum gate set. Building on a recursive algorithm of Freedman and Hastings, we introduce a family of load-aware heuristics that adaptively select vertices and edges to minimize edge participation throughout the cycle basis construction. Our approach improves empirical performance on random regular graphs and on graphs derived from small quantum codes. We further analyze a simplified balls-into-bins process to establish lower bounds on edge participation. While the model differs from the cycle basis algorithm on real graphs, it captures what can be proven for our heuristics without using complex graph theoretic properties related to the distribution of cycles in the graph. Our analysis suggests that the maximum load of our heuristics grows on the order of (log n)^2. Our results indicate that careful cycle basis construction can yield significant practical benefits in the design of fault-tolerant quantum systems.

Video-based assessment (VBA) offers an opportunity to generate data-driven insights to reduce variability, optimize training, and improve surgical performance. However, existing tools for workflow analysis remain difficult to standardize and implement. This study aims to develop and validate a VBA tool for workflow analysis across minimally invasive colorectal procedures. A Delphi process was conducted to achieve consensus on generalizable workflow descriptors. The resulting framework informed the development of a new VBA tool, ColoWorkflow. Independent raters then applied ColoWorkflow to a multicentre video dataset of laparoscopic and robotic colorectal surgery (CRS). Applicability and inter-rater reliability were evaluated. Consensus was achieved for 10 procedure-agnostic phases and 34 procedure-specific steps describing CRS workflows. ColoWorkflow was developed and applied to 54 colorectal operative videos (left and right hemicolectomies, sigmoid and rectosigmoid resections, and total proctocolectomies) from five centres. The tool demonstrated broad applicability, with all but one label utilized. Inter-rater reliability was moderate, with mean Cohen's K of 0.71 for phases and 0.66 for steps. Most discrepancies arose at phase transitions and step boundary definitions. ColoWorkflow is the first consensus-based, validated VBA tool for comprehensive workflow analysis in minimally invasive CRS. It establishes a reproducible framework for video-based performance assessment, enabling benchmarking across institutions and supporting the development of artificial intelligence-driven workflow recognition.

Using the extended Huygens-Fresnel principle and the Kolmogorov turbulence model, we derive an analytical expression for the combined density operator of the signal and idler fields generated via SPDC, following propagation through separate turbulent channels. By expressing this density operator in the continuous position basis, we show how the spatial correlations between signal and idler persist through turbulence despite the loss of state purity, as they transition from being quantum to classical in nature.

Using multiple sensors simultaneously offers advantages for probing spatiotemporal correlations of fluctuating fields or the dynamics of point defects. In this work, by integrating NVs with foundry silicon-nitride photonic integrated circuits, we realise the scalable operation of eight localised NV sensors in an array, with simultaneous, distinct readout of the individual sensors. Using the eight NV sensors and machine-learning methods for multi-point magnetic field reconstruction, we demonstrate microscale magnetic localisation of a 30 $\u03bc$m-sized needle tip.

However, it remains unclear whether these tool-enabled gains reflect trustworthy reasoning. Focusing on the Code Interpreter tool, we show that even when tools are selected and executed correctly, TaLMs treat tool outputs as substitutes for reasoning, producing solutions that appear correct but lack coherent justification. We term this failure mode Tool-Induced Myopia (TIM), and study it using PYMATH, a benchmark of 1,679 competition-level mathematical problems for which Python code is helpful but not sufficient. We further develop a multi-dimensional evaluation suite to quantify reasoning degradation in TaLMs relative to their non-tool counterparts. Our findings reveal that while TaLMs achieve up to a 19.3 percentage point gain in final-answer accuracy, their reasoning behavior consistently deteriorates (e.g., non-tool LLMs win up to 41.5% more often in pairwise comparisons of the reasoning process). This degradation intensifies with tool use; the more frequently a model invokes tools, the less coherent its reasoning becomes. Moreover, tool use shifts errors from arithmetic mistakes toward global reasoning failures (logic, assumption, creativity); with TIM present in ~55% of high-risk cases. Finally, we propose a preference-optimization-based framework that realigns TaLMs to use tools as assistive evidence, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning depth under tool use.

However, MCM introduces several sources of error, including measurement-induced crosstalk, idling-qubit decoherence, and reset infidelity, and these errors exhibit pronounced qubit-dependent variability within a single device. Since existing compilers such as the Qiskit-compiler and QR-Map (the state-of-art qubit reuse compiler) do not account for this variability, circuits with frequent MCM operations often experience substantial fidelity loss.\n  In thie paper, we propose MERA, a compilation framework that performs MCM-error-aware layout, routing, and scheduling. MERA leverages lightweight profiling to obtain a stable per-qubit MCM error distribution, which it uses to guide error-aware qubit mapping and SWAP insertions. To further mitigate MCM-related decoherence and crosstalk, MERA augments as-late-as-possible scheduling with context-aware dynamic decoupling. Evaluated on 27 benchmark circuits, MERA achieves 24.94% -- 52.00% fidelity improvement over the Qiskit compiler (optimization level 3) without introducing additional overhead.

However, existing embedding methods face critical limitations when modeling diverse relationship types at scale: Euclidean models struggle with hierarchies, vector space models cannot capture asymmetry, and hyperbolic models fail on symmetric relations. We propose HyperComplEx, a hybrid embedding framework that adaptively combines hyperbolic, complex, and Euclidean spaces via learned attention mechanisms. A relation-specific space weighting strategy dynamically selects optimal geometries for each relation type, while a multi-space consistency loss ensures coherent predictions across spaces. We evaluate HyperComplEx on computer science research knowledge graphs ranging from 1K papers (~25K triples) to 10M papers (~45M triples), demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines including TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, SEPA, and UltraE. Additional tests on standard benchmarks confirm significantly higher results than all baselines.

The approach systematically extends the conventional two-dimensional hexagonal quadrature amplitude modulation (2D-HQAM) constellation into a 3D-HQAM signal space, forming structured lattice configurations. To address the increased decision complexity resulting from a larger number of constellation points, a dimension reduction (DR) technique is introduced, allowing the derivation of closed-form symbol error probability (SEP) expressions under additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) conditions. Theoretical SEPs closely match simulation results, validating the accuracy of the proposed method. The minimum Euclidean distance (MED) of the 3D constellations shows a minimum increase of 12.14% over 2D constellation for 8-HQAM, reaching up to 160.81% for 1024-HQAM constellations. This significant improvement in MED leads to enhanced error performance.

This assumption is untested. We characterize temporal constraint processing across eight production-scale models (2.8-8B parameters) using deadline detection tasks, revealing systematic deployment risks: bimodal performance distribution (models achieve either 95% or 50% accuracy), extreme prompt brittleness (30-60 percentage point swings from formatting changes alone), and systematic action bias (100% false positive rates in failing models). Parameter count shows no correlation with capability in this range-a 3.8B model matches 7B models while other 7B models fail completely. Fine-tuning on 200 synthetic examples improves models with partial capability by 12-37 percentage points. We demonstrate that temporal constraint satisfaction cannot be reliably learned through next-token prediction on natural language, even with targeted fine-tuning.

The common feature of these Euclidean lattices is that their nearest-neighbor models give rise to flat energy bands interpretable through compact localized states. We find that the tree analogs exhibit similar flat or nearly flat energy bands at the corresponding energies. Interestingly, such flat bands in the decorated Cayley trees acquire an interpretation that is absent in their Euclidean counterparts: as edge states localized to the inner or the outer boundary of the tree branches. In particular, we establish an exact correspondence between the Lieb-Cayley tree and an ensemble of one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains, which maps topological edge states on one side of the chains to flat-band states localized in the bulk of the tree, furnishing the flat energy band with a topological stability. Similar mapping to topological edge states or to states bound to edge defects in one-dimensional chains is shown for flat-band states in all the considered tree decorations. We finally show that the persistence of exact flat bands on infinite decorated trees (i.e., Bethe lattices) arises naturally from a covering interpretation of tree graphs. Our findings reveal a rich landscape of flat-band and topological phenomena in non-Euclidean systems, where geometry alone can generate and stabilize unconventional quantum states.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u6784\u6210\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6b27\u6c0f\u683c\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\uff08Lieb\u3001\u53ccLieb\u3001kagome\u548c\u661f\u5f62\u683c\u70b9\uff09\u7684\u6811\u72b6\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7269\u7684\u5168\u8c31\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e9b\u683c\u70b9\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5e73\u5766\u80fd\u5e26\u53ca\u5176\u7d27\u81f4\u5c40\u57df\u6001\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u88c5\u9970\u6027Cayley\u6811\u7684\u8c31\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6b27\u6c0f\u683c\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u5229\u7528\u7d27\u81f4\u5c40\u57df\u6001\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u8fb9\u7f18\u6001\u7684\u7c7b\u6bd4\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u5e73\u5766\u80fd\u5e26\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6240\u8003\u8651\u7684\u6811\u72b6\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7269\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u5bf9\u5e94\u80fd\u91cf\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5e73\u5766\u6216\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5e73\u5766\u7684\u80fd\u5e26\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e73\u5766\u80fd\u5e26\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u5c40\u57df\u5728\u6811\u679d\u5185\u8fb9\u754c\u6216\u5916\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u6001\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86Lieb-Cayley\u6811\u4e0e\u4e00\u7ef4Su-Schrieffer-Heeger\u94fe\u7cfb\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5c06\u94fe\u4e00\u4fa7\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u8fb9\u7f18\u6001\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6811\u7684\u4f53\u5757\u4e2d\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u7684\u5e73\u5766\u5e26\u6001\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u5e73\u5766\u80fd\u5e26\u63d0\u4f9b\u62d3\u6251\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u975e\u6b27\u6c0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5e73\u5e26\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u672c\u8eab\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u975e\u5e38\u89c4\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u3002"}}

However, the adsorption of nonpolar gases, particularly noble gases, poses a considerable challenge under atmospheric pressure and room temperature (RT). Here, we theoretically simulate and experimentally realize the stable adsorption of noble gases like xenon (Xe), krypton (Kr), argon (Ar), and helium (He) on highly rippled graphene at RT. The elemental characteristics of adsorbed Xe are confirmed by electron energy loss spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The adsorbed gas atoms are crystalized with periodic arrangements. These adsorbed noble gases on graphene exhibit high stability at RT and can be completely desorbed at approximately 350 \u00b0C without damaging the intrinsic lattice of graphene. The structural and physical properties of graphene are significantly influenced by the adsorbed gas, and they fully recover after desorption. Additionally, this controllable adsorption could be generalized to other layered adsorbents such as NbSe2, MoS2 and carbon nanotubes.

However, traditional pipelines rely on downlinking all captured images before analysis, introducing delays of hours to days due to restricted communication bandwidth. To address these bottlenecks, emerging systems perform onboard machine learning to prioritize which images to transmit. However, these solutions typically treat each satellite as an isolated compute node, limiting scalability and efficiency. Redundant inference across satellites and tasks further strains onboard power and compute costs, constraining mission scope and responsiveness. We present EarthSight, a distributed runtime framework that redefines satellite image intelligence as a distributed decision problem between orbit and ground. EarthSight introduces three core innovations: (1) multi-task inference on satellites using shared backbones to amortize computation across multiple vision tasks; (2) a ground-station query scheduler that aggregates user requests, predicts priorities, and assigns compute budgets to incoming imagery; and (3) dynamic filter ordering, which integrates model selectivity, accuracy, and execution cost to reject low-value images early and conserve resources. EarthSight leverages global context from ground stations and resource-aware adaptive decisions in orbit to enable constellations to perform scalable, low-latency image analysis within strict downlink bandwidth and onboard power budgets. Evaluations using a prior established satellite simulator show that EarthSight reduces average compute time per image by 1.9x and lowers 90th percentile end-to-end latency from first contact to delivery from 51 to 21 minutes compared to the state-of-the-art baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "EarthSight\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u4f20\u8f93\u6d41\u7a0b\u56e0\u5e26\u5bbd\u9650\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u5c0f\u65f6\u81f3\u6570\u5929\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u707e\u96be\u54cd\u5e94\u7b49\u65f6\u6548\u6027\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u5c06\u536b\u661f\u89c6\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "EarthSight\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u521b\u65b0\u70b9\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1. \u536b\u661f\u4e0a\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u5171\u4eab\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\uff1b2. \u5730\u9762\u7ad9\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff08\u805a\u5408\u8bf7\u6c42\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u3001\u5206\u914d\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\uff09\uff1b3. \u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6392\u5e8f\uff08\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6267\u884c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u524d\u5254\u9664\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cEarthSight\u5c06\u6bcf\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u4e861.9\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u5c0690%\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4ece51\u5206\u949f\u964d\u4f4e\u523021\u5206\u949f\u3002", "conclusion": "EarthSight\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u529f\u8017\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7387\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Yet, applying DT to deformation-based metal forming remains challenging because of the strongly coupled spatial-temporal behavior and the nonlinear relationship between toolpath and material response. For instance, sheet-metal forming by the English wheel, a highly flexible but artisan-dependent process, still lacks digital counterparts that can autonomously plan and adapt forming strategies. This study presents an adaptive DT framework that integrates Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) for physics-aware dimensionality reduction with a Koopman operator for representing nonlinear system in a linear lifted space for the real-time decision-making via model predictive control (MPC). To accommodate evolving process conditions or material states, an online Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm is introduced to update the operator coefficients in real time, enabling continuous adaptation of the DT model as new deformation data become available. The proposed framework is experimentally demonstrated on a robotic English Wheel sheet metal forming system, where deformation fields are measured and modeled under varying toolpaths. Results show that the adaptive DT is capable of controlling the forming process to achieve the given target shape by effectively capturing non-stationary process behaviors. Beyond this case study, the proposed framework establishes a generalizable approach for interpretable, adaptive, and computationally-efficient DT of nonlinear manufacturing systems, bridging reduced-order physics representations with data-driven adaptability to support autonomous process control and optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86POD\u964d\u7ef4\u548cKoopman\u7b97\u5b50\u8868\u793a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u901a\u8fc7RLS\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0\u7b97\u5b50\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u4f7f\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5de5\u827a\u6761\u4ef6\u6216\u6750\u6599\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u82f1\u5f0f\u8f6e\u94a3\u91d1\u6210\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u6210\u578b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u5de5\u827a\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5236\u9020\u7cfb\u7edf\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u53d8\u9769\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u53d8\u5f62\u91d1\u5c5e\u6210\u578b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u82f1\u5f0f\u8f6e\u94a3\u91d1\u6210\u578b\u7b49\u5de5\u827a\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u65f6\u7a7a\u8026\u5408\u5f3a\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u8def\u5f84\u4e0e\u6750\u6599\u54cd\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u4e3b\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u6210\u578b\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5bf9\u5e94\u7269\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u96c6\u6210\u4e86 Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) \u8fdb\u884c\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u964d\u7ef4\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528 Koopman \u7b97\u5b50\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236 (MPC) \u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u5728\u7ebf\u9012\u5f52\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58 (RLS) \u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5b9e\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0\u7b97\u5b50\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5de5\u827a\u6761\u4ef6\u6216\u6750\u6599\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u82f1\u5f0f\u8f6e\u94a3\u91d1\u6210\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u540c\u5de5\u5177\u8def\u5f84\u4e0b\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u573a\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u5de5\u827a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u63a7\u5236\u6210\u578b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u76ee\u6807\u5f62\u72b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u82f1\u5f0f\u8f6e\u94a3\u91d1\u6210\u578b\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5236\u9020\u7cfb\u7edf\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u964d\u9636\u7269\u7406\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u4e3b\u5de5\u827a\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

PoR reveals the most probable ranking of potential outcomes for an individual, and PoB indicates the action most likely to yield the top-ranked outcome for an individual. We then establish identification theorems and derive bounds for these metrics, and present estimation methods. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to illustrate the finite-sample properties of the estimators and demonstrate their application to a real-world dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\uff1a\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u679c\u6392\u540d\u6982\u7387\uff08PoR\uff09\u548c\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6982\u7387\uff08PoB\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8bc6\u522b\u5b9a\u7406\u3001\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5ea6\u91cf\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e94\u7528\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "motivation": "\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u9762\u5bf9\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51b3\u7b56\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5229\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u6765\u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u5907\u9009\u65b9\u6848\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u884c\u52a8\u3002\u901a\u5e38\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u4f1a\u5bf9\u9884\u671f\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u4ee5\u6bd4\u8f83\u5019\u9009\u884c\u52a8\u7684\u504f\u597d\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u679c\u6392\u540d\u6982\u7387\uff08PoR\uff09\u548c\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6982\u7387\uff08PoB\uff09\u3002PoR\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e2a\u4eba\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6700\u53ef\u80fd\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u800cPoB\u5219\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u6700\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u4e2a\u4eba\u5e26\u6765\u6700\u9ad8\u6392\u540d\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u884c\u52a8\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8bc6\u522b\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bf4\u660e\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Given the run-length encoded BWT (RLBWT) of $T$, r-enum runs in $O(n\\log\\log_{w}(n/r))$ time in addition to the time linear to the number of output strings, where $w=\u0398(\\log n)$ is the word size. In this paper, we improve the $O(n\\log\\log_{w}(n/r))$ term to $O(n)$. We also extend r-enum to compute other context-sensitive repeats such as near-supermaximal repeats (NSMRs) and supermaximal repeats, and the context diversity for every maximal repeat in the same complexities. Furthermore, we study the occurrences that witness NSMRs, which have recently attracted attention under the name of net occurrences: An occurrence of a repeat is called a net occurrence if it is not covered by another repeat, and the net frequency of a repeat is the number of its net occurrences. With this terminology, an NSMR is defined to be a repeat with a positive net frequency. Given the RLBWT of $T$, we show how to compute the set $S^{nsmr}$ of all NSMRs in $T$ together with their net frequency/occurrences in $O(n)$ time and $O(r)$ space. We also show that an $O(r)$-space data structure can be built from the RLBWT to support queries of computing the net frequency of any query pattern $P$ in $O(|P|)$ time. The data structure is built in $O(r)$ space and in $O(n)$ time with high probability or deterministic $O(n+|S^{nsmr}|\\log\\log\\min(\u03c3,|S^{nsmr}|))$ time, where $\u03c3\\le r$ is the alphabet size of $T$. To achieve this, we prove that the total number of net occurrences is less than $2r$.

Moreover, most vision-language models (VLMs) usually describe surface materials in RS images using universal texts, lacking proprietary linguistic prior knowledge specific to different RS vision modalities. In this work, we formalize RS multimodality generalization (RSMG) as a learning paradigm, and propose a frequency-aware vision-language multimodality generalization network (FVMGN) for RS image classification. Specifically, a diffusion-based training-test-time augmentation (DTAug) strategy is designed to reconstruct multimodal land-cover distributions, enriching input information for FVMGN. Following that, to overcome multimodal heterogeneity, a multimodal wavelet disentanglement (MWDis) module is developed to learn cross-domain invariant features by resampling low and high frequency components in the frequency domain. Considering the characteristics of RS vision modalities, shared and proprietary class texts is designed as linguistic inputs for the transformer-based text encoder to extract diverse text features. For multimodal vision inputs, a spatial-frequency-aware image encoder (SFIE) is constructed to realize local-global feature reconstruction and representation. Finally, a multiscale spatial-frequency feature alignment (MSFFA) module is suggested to construct a unified semantic space, ensuring refined multiscale alignment of different text and vision features in spatial and frequency domains. Extensive experiments show that FVMGN has the excellent multimodality generalization ability compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aFVMGN\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9065\u611f\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u901a\u7528\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u9065\u611f\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u5927\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFVMGN\uff08\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6cdb\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1. \u6269\u6563\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3-\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u589e\u5f3a\uff08DTAug\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u571f\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u8f93\u5165\u4fe1\u606f\u30022. \u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5c0f\u6ce2\u89e3\u8026\uff08MWDis\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u9891\u57df\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u4f4e\u9891\u548c\u9ad8\u9891\u5206\u91cf\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u8de8\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u30023. \u5171\u4eab\u548c\u4e13\u6709\u7c7b\u522b\u6587\u672c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u7531\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u30024. \u7a7a\u95f4-\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SFIE\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u8868\u793a\u5c40\u90e8-\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u30025. \u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4-\u9891\u7387\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08MSFFA\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u9891\u57df\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFVMGN\u5728\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\uff08SOTA\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f18\u79c0\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "FVMGN\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5904\u7406\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Even more, these No-instances can often be leveraged to prove computational hardness results. We make this impression rigorous in a dynamic model of cardinal hedonic games by providing meta theorems. These imply hardness of deciding about the possible or necessary convergence of deviation dynamics based on the mere existence of No-instances. Our results hold for additively separable, fractional, and modified fractional hedonic games (ASHGs, FHGs, and MFHGs). Moreover, they encompass essentially all reasonable stability notions based on single-agent deviations. In addition, we propose dynamics as a method to find individually rational and contractually individual stable (CIS) partitions in ASHGs. In particular, we find that CIS dynamics from the singleton partition possibly converge after a linear number of deviations but may require an exponential number of deviations in the worst case.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u7a33\u5b9a\u5206\u914d\u5728\u9700\u6c42\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7ed3\u679c\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u5143\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4e3a\u9700\u6c42\u535a\u5f08\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u4ec5\u51ed\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u5c31\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5173\u4e8e\u504f\u79bb\u52a8\u6001\u6536\u655b\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u6216\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u96be\u5ea6\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u3001\u5206\u6570\u548c\u4fee\u6539\u5206\u6570\u9700\u6c42\u535a\u5f08\uff08ASHGs\u3001FHGs\u548cMFHGs\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u504f\u79bb\u7684\u6240\u6709\u5408\u7406\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728ASHGs\u4e2d\u5bfb\u627e\u4e2a\u4f53\u7406\u6027\u548c\u5408\u540c\u4e2a\u4f53\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff08CIS\uff09\u5206\u914d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u4ece\u5355\u4f8b\u5206\u914d\u5f00\u59cb\u7684CIS\u52a8\u6001\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u504f\u79bb\u540e\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6700\u574f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u6307\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u504f\u79bb\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u5728\u9700\u6c42\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u627e\u5230\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5206\u914d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u516c\u8ba4\u7684\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5e76\u975e\u6240\u6709\u535a\u5f08\u90fd\u5b58\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u5143\u5b9a\u7406\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u535a\u5f08\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u52a0\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u3001\u5206\u6570\u548c\u4fee\u6539\u5206\u6570\u9700\u6c42\u535a\u5f08\uff08ASHGs\u3001FHGs\u548cMFHGs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6765\u8bc1\u660e\u8ba1\u7b97\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u504f\u79bb\u52a8\u6001\u5bfb\u627e\u4e2a\u4f53\u7406\u6027\u548c\u5408\u540c\u4e2a\u4f53\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff08CIS\uff09\u5206\u914d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728ASHGs\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u4f8b\u5206\u914d\u5f00\u59cb\u7684CIS\u52a8\u6001\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u504f\u79bb\u540e\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6700\u574f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u6307\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u504f\u79bb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ec5\u51ed\u9700\u6c42\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u5c31\u8db3\u4ee5\u8bc1\u660e\u5173\u4e8e\u504f\u79bb\u52a8\u6001\u6536\u655b\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u6216\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u96be\u5ea6\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728ASHGs\u4e2d\u5bfb\u627eCIS\u5206\u914d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u6700\u574f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u7684\u504f\u79bb\u3002"}}

Based on prior work in simple orbits, our method produces a broad class of stable, periodic trajectories by stabilizing the system around a Lie group-based geometric embedding. Employing the Lie group SO(3), we generate a wider range of periodic curves than existing quaternion-based methods. Furthermore, we exploit SO(3) properties to eliminate the need for velocity inputs, allowing agents to receive only position inputs. We also propose a novel phase controller that ensures uniform agent separation, along with a formal stability proof.

However, extending EQCs to larger TSP problem sizes remains challenging due to the exponential time and memory for quantum circuit simulation, as well as increasing noise and decoherence when running on actual quantum hardware. In this work, we propose the Size-Invariant Grid Search (SIGS), an efficient training optimization for Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL), and use it to simulate the outputs of a trained Depth-1 EQC up to 350-node TSP instances - well beyond previously tractable limits. At TSP with 100 nodes, we reduce total simulation times by 96.4%, when comparing to RL simulations with the analytical expression (151 minutes using RL to under 6 minutes using SIGS on TSP-100), while achieving a mean optimality gap within 0.005 of the RL trained model on the test set. SIGS provides a practical benchmarking tool for the QRL community, allowing us to efficiently analyze the performance of QRL algorithms on larger problem sizes.

While there are various approaches for explaining positive entailments (why is C(a) entailed by the knowledge base) as well as missing entailments (why is C(b) not entailed) in isolation, contrastive explanations consider both at the same time, which allows them to focus on the relevant commonalities and differences between a and b. We develop an appropriate notion of contrastive explanations for the special case of ABox reasoning with description logic ontologies, and analyze the computational complexity for different variants under different optimality criteria, considering lightweight as well as more expressive description logics. We implemented a first method for computing one variant of contrastive explanations, and evaluated it on generated problems for realistic knowledge bases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u56de\u7b54\u201c\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48 a \u662f C \u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u800c b \u4e0d\u662f\uff1f\u201d\u8fd9\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027 ABox \u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u522b\u89e3\u91ca\u6b63\u8574\u542b\uff08\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48 C(a) \u88ab\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u8574\u542b\uff09\u548c\u7f3a\u5931\u8574\u542b\uff08\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48 C(b) \u4e0d\u88ab\u8574\u542b\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5173\u6ce8 a \u548c b \u4e4b\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5171\u6027\u548c\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\u672c\u4f53\u7684 ABox \u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u6807\u51c6\u4e0b\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u548c\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u7684\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027 ABox \u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u672c\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u521d\u6b65\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u3002"}}

Typical end-to-end HGNNs require repetitive message passing during training, limiting efficiency for large-scale real-world graphs. Pre-computation-based HGNNs address this by performing message passing only once during preprocessing, collecting neighbor information into regular-shaped tensors, which enables efficient mini-batch training. Label-based pre-computation methods collect neighbors' label information but suffer from training label leakage, where a node's own label information propagates back to itself during multi-hop message passing - the echo effect. Existing mitigation strategies are memory-inefficient on large graphs or suffer from compatibility issues with advanced message passing methods. We propose Echoless Label-based Pre-computation (Echoless-LP), which eliminates training label leakage with Partition-Focused Echoless Propagation (PFEP). PFEP partitions target nodes and performs echoless propagation, where nodes in each partition collect label information only from neighbors in other partitions, avoiding echo while remaining memory-efficient and compatible with any message passing method. We also introduce an Asymmetric Partitioning Scheme (APS) and a PostAdjust mechanism to address information loss from partitioning and distributional shifts across partitions. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that Echoless-LP achieves superior performance and maintains memory efficiency compared to baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "HGNNs\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6b21\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u6b21\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u6cc4\u9732\uff08\u56de\u58f0\u6548\u5e94\uff09\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Echoless-LP\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7PFEP\uff08\u5206\u533a\u805a\u7126\u65e0\u56de\u58f0\u4f20\u64ad\uff09\u6765\u6d88\u9664\u6807\u7b7e\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528APS\uff08\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u5206\u533a\u65b9\u6848\uff09\u548cPostAdjust\u673a\u5236\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eEcholess-LP\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aefHGNNs\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u4e0a\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684HGNNs\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6807\u7b7e\u6cc4\u9732\uff08\u56de\u58f0\u6548\u5e94\uff09\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u6216\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7ea7\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aEcholess-LP\uff08\u65e0\u56de\u58f0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u5229\u7528PFEP\uff08\u5206\u533a\u805a\u7126\u7684\u65e0\u56de\u58f0\u4f20\u64ad\uff09\u6765\u6d88\u9664\u8bad\u7ec3\u6807\u7b7e\u6cc4\u9732\u3002PFEP\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u533a\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u56de\u58f0\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5206\u533a\u4e2d\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u4ec5\u4ece\u5176\u4ed6\u5206\u533a\u4e2d\u7684\u90bb\u5c45\u6536\u96c6\u6807\u7b7e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u907f\u514d\u56de\u58f0\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u517c\u5bb9\u4efb\u4f55\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86APS\uff08\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u5206\u533a\u65b9\u6848\uff09\u548cPostAdjust\u673a\u5236\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u533a\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEcholess-LP\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "Echoless-LP\u901a\u8fc7PFEP\u3001APS\u548cPostAdjust\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86HGNNs\u4e2d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6807\u7b7e\u6cc4\u9732\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, most existing studies rely on idealized channel models and lack hardware validation, leaving a gap between algorithmic design and practical deployment. Meanwhile, recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI)-driven precoding have shown strong potential for learning nonlinear channel-to-precoder mappings, but their real-world deployment remains limited due to challenges in data collection and model generalization. This work presents a framework for implementing and validating an AI-based precoder on a D-MIMO testbed with hardware reciprocity calibration. A pre-trained graph neural network (GNN)-based model is fine-tuned using real-world channel state information (CSI) collected from the Techtile platform and evaluated under both interpolation and extrapolation scenarios before end-to-end validation. Experimental results demonstrate a 15.7% performance gain over the pre-trained model in the multi-user case after fine-tuning, while in the single-user scenario the model achieves near-maximum ratio transmission (MRT) performance with less than 0.7 bits/channel use degradation out of a total throughput of 5.19 bits/channel use on unseen positions.

Traditional approaches rely on analytically derived Lyapunov functions, which are often conservative and challenging to construct for high-dimensional or highly nonlinear systems. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for learning and verifying RoA estimates for nonlinear systems using neural-network-based Lyapunov functions. Our method employs a composite Lyapunov function that combines a quadratic term with a neural-network-based component, providing both structure and flexibility. We introduce a novel homogeneous loss function for training, which removes the imbalance typically caused by the two non-homogeneous Lyapunov conditions. Together, these two aspects enable efficient training of the Lyapunov candidate. To guarantee the correctness of the learned Lyapunov function, we employ a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver to formally verify the stability results. Lastly, we perform a deeper analysis near the origin to overcome numerical artifacts, ensuring strict asymptotic stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on benchmark nonlinear systems, showing that it significantly reduces conservatism compared to traditional Lyapunov methods while maintaining verifiability.

While prior surveys focus on efficiency by examining how to shorten reasoning chains or reduce computation, this view overlooks a fundamental challenge: current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey reframes reasoning through the lens of {adaptivity}: the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty. We make three contributions. First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies. We conclude by identifying open challenges in self-evaluation, meta-reasoning, and human-aligned reasoning control.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u6574\u3002\u672c\u8c03\u67e5\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u201c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u201d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5373\u6839\u636e\u8f93\u5165\uff08\u5982\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\u5206\u914d\u63a8\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5185\u5bb9\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1. \u5728LLM\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6f14\u7ece\u3001\u5f52\u7eb3\u548c\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\uff1b2. \u5c06\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e24\u7c7b\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u5143\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u9762\u5411\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u6027\u8c03\u6574\u63a8\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u957f\uff0c\u56f0\u96be\u4efb\u52a1\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "1. \u5728LLM\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6f14\u7ece\u3001\u5f52\u7eb3\u548c\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u30022. \u5c06\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u63a7\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u30023. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff09\u548c\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u505c\u6b62\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7ec4\u5408\uff09\u4e24\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u662fLLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u5143\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u9762\u5411\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

While this has been known for the $\\ell_{\\infty}$ norm via the multiplicative weights update method, existing proof techniques do not extend to arbitrary ordered norms. Our algorithm uses a resource price mechanism that is motivated by the follow-the-regularized-leader paradigm, and is expressed by smooth approximations of ordered norms. We need and show that these have non-trivial stability properties, which may be of independent interest. For each customer, we define dynamic cost budgets, which evolve throughout the algorithm, to determine the allowed step sizes.

To further reduce the number of trainable parameters, we propose a point-cloud-specific PEFT, termed Graph Features Tuning (GFT), which learns a dynamic graph from initial tokenized inputs of the transformer using a lightweight graph convolution network and passes these graph features to deeper layers via skip connections and efficient cross-attention modules. Extensive experiments on object classification and segmentation tasks show that GFT operates in the same domain, rivalling existing methods, while reducing the trainable parameters.

We present a data-driven, abstraction-based control framework that integrates online learning with novel incremental game-solving. Under appropriate continuity assumptions, our method abstracts the system dynamics into a finite stochastic (2.5-player) game graph derived from data. Given a requirement over time on this graph, we compute the winning region -- i.e., the set of initial states from which the objective is satisfiable -- in the resulting game, together with a corresponding control policy.\n  Our main contribution is the construction of abstractions, winning regions and control policies incrementally, as data about the system dynamics accumulates. Concretely, our algorithm refines under- and over-approximations of reachable sets for each state-action pair as new data samples arrive. These refinements induce structural modifications in the game graph abstraction -- such as the addition or removal of nodes and edges -- which in turn modify the winning region. Crucially, we show that these updates are inherently monotonic: under-approximations can only grow, over-approximations can only shrink, and the winning region can only expand.\n  We exploit this monotonicity by defining an objective-induced ranking function on the nodes of the abstract game that increases monotonically as new data samples are incorporated. These ranks underpin our novel incremental game-solving algorithm, which employs customized gadgets (DAG-like subgames) within a rank-lifting algorithm to efficiently update the winning region. Numerical case studies demonstrate significant computational savings compared to the baseline approach, which resolves the entire game from scratch whenever new data samples arrive.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u65ad\u7d2f\u79ef\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u589e\u91cf\u5f0f\u5730\u5408\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u65f6\u5e8f\u903b\u8f91\u76ee\u6807\uff08temporal logic objectives\uff09\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08discrete-time stochastic dynamical systems\uff09\u5177\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u65f6\u5e8f\u903b\u8f91\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u9996\u5148\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u62bd\u8c61\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u9650\u968f\u673a\uff082.5-\u73a9\u5bb6\uff09\u535a\u5f08\u56fe\uff08game graph\uff09\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u535a\u5f08\u56fe\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6ee1\u8db3\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u96c6\u5408\uff08winning region\uff09\u548c\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u5728\u4e8e\u589e\u91cf\u5f0f\u5730\u6784\u5efa\u62bd\u8c61\u3001\u535a\u5f08\u56fe\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5b83\u4f1a\u968f\u7740\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5230\u8fbe\uff0c\u4e0d\u65ad\u4f18\u5316\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u7684\u53ef\u8fbe\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff08under- and over-approximations\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fee\u6539\u535a\u5f08\u56fe\u548c\u535a\u5f08\u7684\u83b7\u80dc\u533a\u57df\u3002\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u5355\u8c03\u6027\uff08monotonicity\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u76ee\u6807\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u51fd\u6570\uff08ranking function\uff09\u548c\u4e00\u79cd\u589e\u91cf\u5f0f\u535a\u5f08\u6c42\u89e3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u5b50\u535a\u5f08\uff08gadgets\uff09\u6765\u9ad8\u6548\u66f4\u65b0\u83b7\u80dc\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e0e\u6bcf\u6b21\u66f4\u65b0\u90fd\u4ece\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\u6c42\u89e3\u6574\u4e2a\u535a\u5f08\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u8282\u7701\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5904\u7406\u672a\u77e5\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u6ee1\u8db3\u65f6\u5e8f\u903b\u8f91\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u8fbe\u96c6\u5408\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u66f4\u65b0\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Prior approaches typically fall into two extremes -- either learning the entire task or relying on privileged information and hand-designed planners -- both of which struggle to handle diverse objects in long-horizon tasks. To address these challenges, we present a unified framework for collaborative multi-robot, multi-object non-prehensile manipulation that integrates flow-matching co-generation with anonymous multi-robot motion planning. Within this framework, a generative model co-generates contact formations and manipulation trajectories from visual observations, while a novel motion planner conveys robots at scale. Crucially, the same planner also supports coordination at the object level, assigning manipulated objects to larger target structures and thereby unifying robot- and object-level reasoning within a single algorithmic framework. Experiments in challenging simulated environments demonstrate that our approach outperforms baselines in both motion planning and manipulation tasks, highlighting the benefits of generative co-design and integrated planning for scaling collaborative manipulation to complex multi-agent, multi-object settings.

However, to harness these advantages, it is crucial that the quantum channels used to store or transmit the subsystems of an entangled system not only preserve entanglement but also maintain its dimensionality above a certain threshold. The maximum entanglement dimension that a channel can preserve is referred to as its effective dimensionality, since the channel cannot be used to transmit information of dimension greater than that in a single use. In this work, we present a method to certify whether a quantum channel can preserve entanglement dimension above a given threshold. Unlike existing approaches, our method is faithful -- it can be applied to any channel, and avoids common assumptions such as reliable preparation of entangled states, auxiliary side channels, or perfect measurement devices.

Existing multi-objective alignment methods rely on manually specified preference weights, which not only burden users with difficult preference specification tasks but also lead to suboptimal training efficiency due to exploration of irrelevant preference combinations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel framework named PRO, i.e., PReference Orchestrator, which features a lightweight preference adapter that automatically infers prompt-specific preference weights during both training and deployment phases. Specifically, the adapter automatically learns appropriate preference weights for each prompt by training on normalized reward scores from multiple reward models for preferred responses, which inherently reflect effective preference balances across objectives. Additionally, We provide theoretical analysis proving that our prompt-aware preference mechanism achieves superior performance compared to fixed preference weights in multi-objective alignment scenarios.

We analyze how these features evolve under an external magnetic field and explain that their visibility in conductance is governed by the spin polarization of the bands.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u81ea\u65cb\u6df7\u5408\u6548\u5e94\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ea6\u745f\u592b\u68ee\u7ed3\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u591a\u91cd Andreev \u53cd\u5c04", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u65cb\u8f68\u9053\u8026\u5408\u5bf9\u81ea\u65cb\u7ea6\u745f\u592b\u68ee\u7ed3\u4e2d\u591a\u91cd Andreev \u53cd\u5c04\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u65cb\u6df7\u5408\u6548\u5e94\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u7535\u5bfc\u8c31", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u81ea\u65cb\u6df7\u5408\u6548\u5e94\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u660e\u663e\u7684\u591a\u91cd Andreev \u53cd\u5c04\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u4f1a\u968f\u7740\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u800c\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u5176\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u80fd\u5e26\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u6781\u5316", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u65cb\u6df7\u5408\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u7ea6\u745f\u592b\u68ee\u7ed3\u4e2d\u8d77\u7740\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5f71\u54cd\u7535\u5bfc\u8c31\u7684\u7279\u5f81"}}

Temperature-dependent neutron powder diffraction confirms the rhombohedral R-3c structure down to 5 K without any structural phase transition. DC magnetization, ac susceptibility, and relaxation measurements reveal a gradual evolution from a high-temperature paramagnetic-like state to a partially disordered antiferromagnetic (PDA) state below 100 K, accompanied by slow cluster-like spin dynamics followed by a freezing transition near 30 K. Isothermal magnetic hysteresis M(H) loops demonstrate partial chain freezing, while robust exchange bias is observed in field-cooled protocols, highlighting the interplay between PDA ordering and frozen spins. Resistivity and specific heat data indicate strong coupling between spin and charge degrees of freedom, accompanied by activated transport behavior. Raman spectroscopy identifies pronounced anomalies in phonon frequencies and linewidths across multiple magnetic regimes, reflecting strong spin-lattice coupling. Polarization-electric field (P-E) measurements reveal temperature-dependent crossovers from linear dielectric to weakly hysteretic behavior, consistent with short-range polar correlations driven by spin-lattice interactions. These findings establish CCIO as a prototypical quasi-one-dimensional frustrated spin-chain system where geometric frustration, spin-orbit coupling, and low-dimensionality generate field-tunable PDA order, glassy spin dynamics, exchange bias, and magnetodielectric coupling. These results provide new insights into frustration-driven phases in low-dimensional oxides and point towards potential multifunctional applications based on intrinsic magnetodielectric and exchange bias phenomena.", "AI": {"tldr": "Ca3CoIrO6 (CCIO) \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u51c6\u4e00\u7ef4\u81ea\u65cb\u94fe\u5316\u5408\u7269\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u90e8\u5206\u65e0\u5e8f\u53cd\u94c1\u78c1\u6709\u5e8f\u3001\u73bb\u7483\u6001\u81ea\u65cb\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u4ea4\u6362\u504f\u501a\u548c\u78c1\u7535\u8026\u5408\u7b49\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u7531\u51e0\u4f55\u632b\u6298\u3001\u81ea\u65cb-\u8f68\u9053\u8026\u5408\u548c\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5f15\u8d77\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u51c6\u4e00\u7ef4\u632b\u6298\u81ea\u65cb\u94fe\u5316\u5408\u7269Ca3CoIrO6 (CCIO) \u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u51e0\u4f55\u632b\u6298\u3001\u81ea\u65cb-\u8f68\u9053\u8026\u5408\u548c\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4\u573a\u53ef\u8c03\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u65e0\u5e8f\u53cd\u94c1\u78c1\u6709\u5e8f\u3001\u73bb\u7483\u6001\u81ea\u65cb\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u78c1\u7535\u8026\u5408\u7b49\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u78c1\u6027\u3001\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u8f93\u8fd0\u3001\u62c9\u66fc\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u4ecb\u7535\u6d4b\u91cf\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e2d\u5b50\u7c89\u672b\u884d\u5c04\u3001\u76f4\u6d41\u78c1\u5316\u3001\u4ea4\u6d41\u78c1\u5316\u7387\u3001\u5f1b\u8c6b\u6d4b\u91cf\u3001\u7b49\u6e29\u78c1\u6ede\u56de\u7ebf\u3001\u7535\u963b\u7387\u3001\u6bd4\u70ed\u3001\u62c9\u66fc\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u7535-\u573a\u6d4b\u91cf\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9CCIO\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "CCIO\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301R-3c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728100 K\u4ee5\u4e0b\u5448\u73b0\u90e8\u5206\u65e0\u5e8f\u53cd\u94c1\u78c1\uff08PDA\uff09\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4f34\u968f\u73bb\u7483\u6001\u81ea\u65cb\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u8fd130 K\u7684\u51bb\u7ed3\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u90e8\u5206\u94fe\u51bb\u7ed3\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u4ea4\u6362\u504f\u501a\u3001\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u81ea\u65cb-\u7535\u8377\u8026\u5408\u3001\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8f93\u8fd0\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u8de8\u8d8a\u591a\u4e2a\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u58f0\u5b50\u5f02\u5e38\u3002\u4ecb\u7535\u6d4b\u91cf\u663e\u793a\u6e29\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u4ecb\u7535\u5230\u5f31\u6ede\u540e\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u7531\u81ea\u65cb-\u6676\u683c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u77ed\u7a0b\u6781\u6027\u5173\u8054\u3002", "conclusion": "CCIO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5178\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u4e00\u7ef4\u632b\u6298\u81ea\u65cb\u94fe\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u5176\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff08\u5982\u573a\u53ef\u8c03\u7684PDA\u6709\u5e8f\u3001\u73bb\u7483\u6001\u81ea\u65cb\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u4ea4\u6362\u504f\u501a\u548c\u78c1\u7535\u8026\u5408\uff09\u6e90\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u632b\u6298\u3001\u81ea\u65cb-\u8f68\u9053\u8026\u5408\u548c\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u632b\u6298\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u76f8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, the resource limitations of such devices and unreliable network conditions necessitate error-resilient device-edge collaboration systems. Traditional approaches focus on bit-level transmission correctness, which can be inefficient under dynamic channel conditions. In contrast, we propose SemanticNN, a semantic codec that tolerates bit-level errors in pursuit of semantic-level correctness, enabling compressive and resilient collaborative inference offloading under strict computational and communication constraints. It incorporates a Bit Error Rate (BER)-aware decoder that adapts to dynamic channel conditions and a Soft Quantization (SQ)-based encoder to learn compact representations. Building on this architecture, we introduce Feature-augmentation Learning, a novel training strategy that enhances offloading efficiency. To address encoder-decoder capability mismatches from asymmetric resources, we propose XAI-based Asymmetry Compensation to enhance decoding semantic fidelity. We conduct extensive experiments on STM32 using three models and six datasets across image classification and object detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, under varying transmission error rates, SemanticNN significantly reduces feature transmission volume by 56.82-344.83x while maintaining superior inference accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "SemanticNN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8bed\u4e49\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bb9\u5fcd\u6bd4\u7279\u7ea7\u9519\u8bef\u6765\u8ffd\u6c42\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea7\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u5f39\u6027\u7684\u534f\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u5378\u8f7d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u7f51\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5bb9\u5fcd\u6bd4\u7279\u7ea7\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u8bbe\u5907-\u8fb9\u7f18\u534f\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSemanticNN\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u8be5\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e2a\u6bd4\u7279\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff08BER\uff09\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6f\u91cf\u5316\uff08SQ\uff09\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08XAI\uff09\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u8865\u507f\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728STM32\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eSemanticNN\u5728\u4f20\u8f93\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06\u7279\u5f81\u4f20\u8f93\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8656.82-344.83\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SemanticNN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u5f39\u6027\u7684\u8bbe\u5907-\u8fb9\u7f18\u534f\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u5378\u8f7d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u4e14\u7f51\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002"}}

Central to this innovation is the ``the one-step policy'' network, which is optimized through a $Q$-function that is regularized with the behavioral cloning from expert trajectories, allowing learning more expressive policies using flow-based generative models. In this paper, we studied the convergence property and stabilizablity of the one-step policy during learning for linear quadratic problems under the offline settings. Our theoretical results are based on a new formulation of the one-step policy loss based on the average expected cost, and regularized with the behavioral cloning loss. Such a formulation allows us to tap into existing strong theoretical results from the policy gradient theorem to study the convergence properties of the one-step policy. We verify our theoretical finding with simulation results on a linearized inverted pendulum.", "AI": {"tldr": "Flow Q-learning \u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u548c Actor-Critic \u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u201c\u5355\u6b65\u7b56\u7565\u201d\u7f51\u7edc\u3002\u8be5\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u8fc7 Q \u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u5177\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u4e8c\u6b21\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5355\u6b65\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u6b65\u7b56\u7565\u635f\u5931\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u671f\u671b\u6210\u672c\u7684\u65b0\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u635f\u5931\u8fdb\u884c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u5b9a\u7406\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5355\u6b65\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u5012\u7acb\u6446\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76 Flow Q-learning \u4e2d\u5355\u6b65\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u6b65\u7b56\u7565\u635f\u5931\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u671f\u671b\u6210\u672c\u7684\u65b0\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u635f\u5931\u8fdb\u884c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u5b9a\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5355\u6b65\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u5012\u7acb\u6446\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "Flow Q-learning \u4e2d\u7684\u5355\u6b65\u7b56\u7565\u5177\u6709\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Although the Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) paradigm offers a promising solution by promoting consensus among multiple agents to enhance reliability, it relies on the unrealistic assumption that all debaters are rational and reflective, which is a condition that may not hold when agents themselves are prone to hallucinations. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-agent Undercover Gaming (MUG) protocol, inspired by social deduction games like \"Who is Undercover?\". MUG reframes MAD as a process of detecting \"undercover\" agents (those suffering from hallucinations) by employing multimodal counterfactual tests. Specifically, we modify reference images to introduce counterfactual evidence and observe whether agents can accurately identify these changes, providing ground-truth for identifying hallucinating agents and enabling robust, crowd-powered multimodal reasoning. MUG advances MAD protocols along three key dimensions: (1) enabling factual verification beyond statistical consensus through counterfactual testing; (2) introducing cross-evidence reasoning via dynamically modified evidence sources instead of relying on static inputs; and (3) fostering active reasoning, where agents engage in probing discussions rather than passively answering questions. Collectively, these innovations offer a more reliable and effective framework for multimodal reasoning in LLMs. The source code can be accessed at https://github.com/YongLD/MUG.git.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u201c\u5367\u5e95\u201d\u6e38\u620f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6f5c\u4f0f\u535a\u5f08\uff08MUG\uff09\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\uff08MAD\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u8fa9\u8bba\u8005\u90fd\u662f\u7406\u6027\u4e14\u6709\u53cd\u601d\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8fd9\u4e00\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u800c\u5f53\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u672c\u8eab\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "method": "MUG \u534f\u8bae\u501f\u9274\u4e86\u201c\u8c01\u662f\u5367\u5e95\u201d\u7b49\u793e\u4ea4\u63a8\u7406\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5c06 MAD \u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc6\u522b\u201c\u5367\u5e95\u201d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff08\u5373\u90a3\u4e9b\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff09\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u4ee5\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u89c2\u5bdf\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u3001\u7531\u4f17\u5305\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "MUG \u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86 MAD \u534f\u8bae\uff1a1. \u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8d8a\u7edf\u8ba1\u5171\u8bc6\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\uff1b2. \u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u6765\u6e90\uff08\u800c\u975e\u9759\u6001\u8f93\u5165\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u8de8\u8bc1\u636e\u63a8\u7406\uff1b3. \u57f9\u517b\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u53c2\u4e0e\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u88ab\u52a8\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "MUG \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e LLMs \u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u8de8\u8bc1\u636e\u63a8\u7406\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We present a correlated purification framework based on semidefinite programming to restore accuracy to these noisy, unphysical two-electron RDMs. The method performs a bi-objective optimization that minimizes both the many-electron energy and the nuclear norm of the change in the measured 2-RDM. The nuclear norm, often employed in matrix completion, promotes low-rank, physically meaningful corrections to the 2-RDM, while the energy term acts as a regularization term that can improve the purity of the ground state. While the method is particularly effective for the ground state, it can also be applied to excited and non-stationary states by decreasing the weight of the energy relative to the error norm. In an application to fermionic shadow tomography of large hydrogen chains, correlated purification yields substantial reductions in both energy and 2-RDM error, achieving chemical accuracy across dissociation curves. This framework provides a robust strategy for tomography in many-body quantum simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u534a\u5b9a\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u7ea0\u6b63\u91cf\u5b50\u9634\u5f71\u65ad\u5c42\u626b\u63cf\u4e2d\u7531\u566a\u58f0\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u4e0d\u7269\u7406\u4e24\u4f53\u7ea6\u5316\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\uff08RDMs\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u80fd\u91cf\u548cRDMs\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6c22\u94fe\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5316\u5b66\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u9634\u5f71\u65ad\u5c42\u626b\u63cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u6027\u8d28\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7ea6\u5316\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\uff08RDMs\uff09\u5e38\u5e38\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3N-\u53ef\u8868\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u8868\u793aN-\u7535\u5b50\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u534a\u5b9a\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u5173\u8054\u51c0\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u6765\u6062\u590d\u5608\u6742\u3001\u4e0d\u7269\u7406\u7684\u4e24\u4f53RDMs\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u4f18\u5316\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u591a\u4f53\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u5230\u76842-RDM\u53d8\u5316\u91cf\u7684\u6838\u8303\u6570\u3002\u6838\u8303\u6570\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u4f4e\u79e9\u3001\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u76842-RDM\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u800c\u80fd\u91cf\u9879\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u57fa\u6001\u7684\u7eaf\u5ea6\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u57fa\u6001\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u9879\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u6765\u5e94\u7528\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u6c22\u94fe\u8fdb\u884c\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u9634\u5f71\u65ad\u5c42\u626b\u63cf\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u5173\u8054\u51c0\u5316\u5728\u80fd\u91cf\u548c2-RDM\u8bef\u5dee\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u89e3\u79bb\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u5316\u5b66\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5173\u8054\u51c0\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8bb8\u591a\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u65ad\u5c42\u626b\u63cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u7ea0\u6b63\u7531\u566a\u58f0\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u7269\u7406\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose a geometry map-based propagation model that directly extracts key parameters from a 3D geometry map and incorporates the Uniform Theory of Diffraction (UTD) to recursively compute multiple diffraction fields, thereby enabling accurate prediction of large-scale path loss and time-varying Doppler characteristics in urban channels. A significant buildings identification algorithm is developed to efficiently detect buildings that significantly affect signal propagation. The proposed model is validated using urban measurement data, showing excellent agreement with path loss in both LOS and NLOS conditions. In particular, for NLOS scenarios with complex diffraction mechanisms, it outperforms the 3GPP and simplified models, reducing the RMSE by 7.1 dB and 3.18 dB, respectively.

We first identify a patent-specific failure mode of SimCSE style dropout augmentation: it produces overly uniform embeddings that lose semantic cohesion. To remedy this, we propose section-based augmentation, where different sections of a patent (e.g., abstract, claims, background) serve as complementary views. This design introduces natural semantic and structural diversity, mitigating over-dispersion and yielding embeddings that better preserve both global structure and local continuity. On large-scale benchmarks, our fully self-supervised method matches or surpasses citation-and IPC-supervised baselines in prior-art retrieval and classification, while avoiding reliance on brittle or incomplete annotations. Our analysis further shows that different sections specialize for different tasks-claims and summaries benefit retrieval, while background sections aid classification-highlighting the value of patents' inherent discourse structure for representation learning.

Greedy optimization methods, commonly used for LPC, alternate between clustering and linear regression but lack global optimality. While effective for separable clusters, they struggle in non-separable settings where clusters overlap in feature space. In an alternative constrained optimization paradigm, Bertsimas and Shioda (2007) formulated LPC as a Mixed-Integer Program (MIP), ensuring global optimality regardless of separability but suffering from poor scalability. This work builds on the constrained optimization paradigm to introduce two novel approaches that improve the efficiency of global optimization for LPC. By leveraging key theoretical properties of separability, we derive near-optimal approximations with provable error bounds, significantly reducing the MIP formulation's complexity and improving scalability. Additionally, we can further approximate LPC as a Quadratic Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (QPBO) problem, achieving substantial computational improvements in some settings. Comparative analyses on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently achieve near-optimal solutions with substantially lower regression errors than greedy optimization while exhibiting superior scalability over existing MIP formulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u805a\u7c7b(LPC)\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u5bf9\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7ec4\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u6216\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u9650\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5c06LPC\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e3a\u4e8c\u6b21\u4f2a\u5e03\u5c14\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LPC\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u8d2a\u5fc3\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u89c4\u5212\uff09\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6216\u5904\u7406\u975e\u53ef\u5206\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1. \u5229\u7528\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u8d28\u63a8\u5bfc\u8fd1\u4f18\u8fd1\u4f3c\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u964d\u4f4eMIP\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1b2. \u5c06LPC\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e3a\u4e8c\u6b21\u4f2a\u5e03\u5c14\u4f18\u5316\uff08QPBO\uff09\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u8fd1\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u56de\u5f52\u8bef\u5dee\u4f4e\u4e8e\u8d2a\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709MIP\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3LPC\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

We present \\ourmodel, a surrogate model that combines graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs) to capture both spatial and temporal patterns from port level router data. \\ourmodel outperforms existing statistical and machine learning baselines, enabling accurate runtime prediction and supporting efficient hybrid simulation of Dragonfly networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Dragonfly\u7f51\u7edc\u4e92\u8fde\u662f\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4eff\u771f\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6216\u5b9e\u65f6\u573a\u666f\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\\ourmodel\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b83\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNN\uff09\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u8def\u7531\u5668\u7aef\u53e3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u7a7a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9Dragonfly\u7f51\u7edc\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4eff\u771f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3Dragonfly\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5e72\u6270\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u73b0\u6709\u4eff\u771f\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\\ourmodel\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNN\uff09\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u8def\u7531\u5668\u7aef\u53e3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\\ourmodel\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\\ourmodel\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0Dragonfly\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4eff\u771f\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Here, we review the current advances on this topic, focusing mainly on key degradation mechanisms and methodologies such as physics-aware, data-driven, and hybrid modeling approaches. Key open challenges are analyzed, including the need for more accurate degradation modeling, effective management of multi-stack systems, and advancements in the currently underdeveloped action phase, in which diagnostic and prognostic insights are translated into real-time system responses, such as dynamic load derating, thermal-management adjustments, or automated maintenance triggers, to prevent failures and extend PEFC life. While notable strides have been made in recent years in diagnostics and remaining useful life estimation, it remains challenging to seamlessly integrate these insights into actionable strategies. Future directions highlight the need to address data scarcity and advance interdisciplinary research. Key focus areas include sensor integration, artificial intelligence, and digital twins.

Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 95.25\\% accuracy on RWF-2000 and significantly improves performance on long videos (UCF-Crime: 83.25\\%), confirming its strong generalization and real-time applicability in intelligent surveillance systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u77ed\u7a97\u53e3\u6ed1\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u76d1\u63a7\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u66b4\u529b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u66b4\u529b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b9e\u65f6\u66b4\u529b\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u62101-2\u79d2\u7684\u77ed\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u52a8\u5b57\u5e55\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u77ed\u7247\u6bb5\u5229\u7528\u6240\u6709\u5e27\u6765\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5feb\u901f\u66b4\u529b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u5728RWF-2000\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8695.25%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728UCF-Crime\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0883.25%\uff09\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u77ed\u7a97\u53e3\u6ed1\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u66b4\u529b\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To further enhance reasoning and accuracy on complex tasks, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising framework that engages multiple LLM agents in structured debates to encourage diverse reasoning. However, triggering MAD for every query is inefficient, as it incurs substantial computational (token) cost and may even degrade accuracy by overturning correct single-agent answers. To address these limitations, we propose intelligent Multi-Agent Debate (iMAD), a token-efficient framework that selectively triggers MAD only when it is likely to be beneficial (i.e., correcting an initially wrong answer). To achieve this goal, iMAD learns generalizable model behaviors to make accurate debate decisions. Specifically, iMAD first prompts a single agent to produce a structured self-critique response, from which we extract 41 interpretable linguistic and semantic features capturing hesitation cues. Then, iMAD uses a lightweight debate-decision classifier, trained using our proposed FocusCal loss, to determine whether to trigger MAD, enabling robust debate decisions without test dataset-specific tuning. Through extensive experiments using six (visual) question answering datasets against five competitive baselines, we have shown that iMAD significantly reduces token usage (by up to 92%) while also improving final answer accuracy (by up to 13.5%).", "AI": {"tldr":

This requires relatively heavy equipment for insertion, which is problematic for anchoring in hard-to-access sites, including in extraterrestrial locations. In contrast, for tree roots, the external reaction force required to extract is much greater than required to insert--little more than the weight of the seed initiates insertion. This is partly due to the mechanism by which roots insert into the ground: tip extension. Proof-of-concept robotic prototypes have shown the benefits of using this mechanism, but a rigorous understanding of the underlying granular mechanics and how they inform the design of a robotic anchor is lacking. Here, we study the terradynamics of tip-extending anchors compared to traditional piling-like intruders, develop a set of design insights, and apply these to create a deployable robotic anchor. Specifically, we identify that to increase an anchor's ratio of extraction force to insertion force, it should: (i) extend beyond a critical depth; (ii) include hair-like protrusions; (iii) extend near-vertically, and (iv) incorporate multiple smaller anchors rather than a single large anchor. Synthesizing these insights, we developed a lightweight, soft robotic, root-inspired anchoring device that inserts into the ground with a reaction force less than its weight. We demonstrate that the 300 g device can deploy a series of temperature sensors 45 cm deep into loose Martian regolith simulant while anchoring with an average of 120 N, resulting in an anchoring-to-weight ratio of 40:1.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6253\u6869\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u6811\u6839\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u3001\u5177\u6709\u5c16\u7aef\u5ef6\u4f38\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8f7b\u8d28\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u951a\u56fa\u88c5\u7f6e\uff0c\u8be5\u88c5\u7f6e\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u5c0f\u4e8e\u5176\u81ea\u8eab\u91cd\u91cf\u7684\u529b\u63d2\u5165\u5730\u9762\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u62d4\u51fa/\u63d2\u5165\u529b\u6bd4\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u96be\u4ee5\u8fdb\u5165\u7684\u533a\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5de5\u7a0b\u6869\u7684\u6253\u5165\u529b\u8fdc\u5927\u4e8e\u62d4\u51fa\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u7ed9\u8bbe\u5907\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6c89\u91cd\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u5e76\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u96be\u4ee5\u5230\u8fbe\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff08\u5982\u5916\u661f\u5730\u8c8c\uff09\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u800c\u6811\u6839\u7684\u62d4\u51fa\u529b\u8fdc\u5927\u4e8e\u6253\u5165\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u542f\u53d1\u4e86\u672c\u6587\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5c16\u7aef\u5ef6\u4f38\u951a\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6869\u5f0f\u5165\u4fb5\u4f53\u7684\u571f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u5982\u5ef6\u4f38\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u8868\u9762\u6bdb\u53d1\u72b6\u7a81\u8d77\u3001\u5ef6\u4f38\u89d2\u5ea6\u548c\u951a\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u8f7b\u8d28\u3001\u8f6f\u4f53\u3001\u53d7\u6811\u6839\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u951a\u56fa\u88c5\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd300\u514b\u7684\u8f7b\u8d28\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u951a\u56fa\u88c5\u7f6e\uff0c\u8be5\u88c5\u7f6e\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u5c0f\u4e8e\u5176\u81ea\u8eab\u91cd\u91cf\u7684\u529b\u63d2\u5165\u677e\u6563\u7684\u706b\u661f\u6a21\u62df\u571f\u58e4\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fbe\u523045\u5398\u7c73\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b120\u725b\u987f\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u951a\u56fa\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8640:1\u7684\u951a\u56fa\u529b\u4e0e\u91cd\u91cf\u6bd4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53d7\u6811\u6839\u5c16\u7aef\u5ef6\u4f38\u673a\u5236\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u951a\u56fa\u88c5\u7f6e\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u62d4\u51fa/\u63d2\u5165\u529b\u6bd4\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u96be\u4ee5\u5230\u8fbe\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5916\u661f\u73af\u5883\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u951a\u56fa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We evaluated 15 open-weight LLMs on pathology and radiology reports across six use cases, colorectal liver metastases, liver tumours, neurodegenerative diseases, soft-tissue tumours, melanomas, and sarcomas, at three institutes in the Netherlands, UK, and Czech Republic. Models included general-purpose and medical-specialised LLMs of various sizes, and six prompting strategies were compared: zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and prompt graph. Performance was assessed using task-appropriate metrics, with consensus rank aggregation and linear mixed-effects models quantifying variance. Top-ranked models achieved macro-average scores close to inter-rater agreement across tasks.

This localization invalidates the conventional Bloch band theory, necessitating an analysis under open boundary conditions even in the thermodynamic limit. The Amoeba formulation addresses this challenge by computing the spectral potential rather than the spectrum itself. Based on the (strong) Szeg\u00f6 limit theorem and its topological generalization, this approach reduces the evaluation of the potential to an optimization problem involving the Ronkin function. However, while the generalized Szeg\u00f6 limit theorem is formally applicable in arbitrary dimensions, its implementation is limited to single-band systems, and its applicability to multiband systems remains unclear. In this paper, we establish the Wiener-Hopf factorization (WHF) of the non-Bloch Hamiltonian as a powerful framework, providing a unified and rigorous foundation for Amoeba analysis in multiband systems. By combining the WHF with Hermitian doubling, we first elucidate the applicability criteria for the generalized Szeg\u00f6 limit theorem in multiband systems. We then show that the WHF provides the natural mathematical origin for the symmetry-decomposed Ronkin function in symmetry class AII$^\\dagger$, leading to a rigorous proof of the generalized Szeg\u00f6 limit theorem for these systems and opening a path toward systematic generalizations to other symmetry classes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u62d3\u6251\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u8d8b\u80a4\u6548\u5e94 (NHSE) \u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u4f53\u6a21\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5c40\u57df\u5316\uff0c\u8fd9\u7834\u574f\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5e03\u6d1b\u8d6b\u80fd\u5e26\u7406\u8bba\u3002Amoeba \u7406\u8bba\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u8c31\u52bf\u800c\u975e\u8c31\u672c\u8eab\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6d89\u53ca Ronkin \u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u5e26\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528\u7ef4\u7eb3-\u970d\u666e\u592b\u5206\u89e3 (WHF) \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u5e26\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684 Amoeba \u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u7ed3\u5408 WHF \u548c\u5384\u7c73\u52a0\u500d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u5e7f\u4e49 Szeg\u00f6 \u6781\u9650\u5b9a\u7406\u5728\u591a\u5e26\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e25\u683c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728 AII$^\text{\u2020}$ \u5bf9\u79f0\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u5bf9\u79f0\u7c7b\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5e03\u6d1b\u8d6b\u80fd\u5e26\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u8d8b\u80a4\u6548\u5e94 (NHSE) \u9762\u524d\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u8be5\u6548\u5e94\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f53\u6a21\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u3002Amoeba \u7406\u8bba\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u8c31\u52bf\u800c\u975e\u8c31\u672c\u8eab\u6765\u89e3\u51b3 NHSE \u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u591a\u5e26\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u591a\u5e26\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684 Amoeba \u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u9610\u660e\u5e7f\u4e49 Szeg\u00f6 \u6781\u9650\u5b9a\u7406\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528\u7ef4\u7eb3-\u970d\u666e\u592b\u5206\u89e3 (WHF) \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5384\u7c73\u52a0\u500d\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u5e26\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u8d8b\u80a4\u6548\u5e94 (NHSE) \u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 WHF \u9610\u660e\u4e86\u5e7f\u4e49 Szeg\u00f6 \u6781\u9650\u5b9a\u7406\u5728\u591a\u5e26\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86 WHF \u662f\u5bf9\u79f0\u7c7b AII$^\text{\u2020}$ \u4e2d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5206\u89e3\u7684 Ronkin \u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u8be5\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49 Szeg\u00f6 \u6781\u9650\u5b9a\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u8bc1\u660e\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u7ef4\u7eb3-\u970d\u666e\u592b\u5206\u89e3 (WHF) \u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u5e26\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u8d8b\u80a4\u6548\u5e94 (NHSE) \u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a Amoeba \u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u5e7f\u4e49 Szeg\u00f6 \u6781\u9650\u5b9a\u7406\u5728\u591a\u5e26\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5bf9\u79f0\u7c7b AII$^\text{\u2020}$ \u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u5b9a\u7406\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5c06\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u5bf9\u79f0\u7c7b\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7ef4\u7eb3-\u970d\u666e\u592b\u5206\u89e3 (WHF) \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5730\u6269\u5c55\u4e86 Amoeba \u5206\u6790\u5728\u591a\u5e26\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5904\u7406\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u8d8b\u80a4\u6548\u5e94 (NHSE) \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4ec5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5e7f\u4e49 Szeg\u00f6 \u6781\u9650\u5b9a\u7406\u5728\u591a\u5e26\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u7c7b\u65b9\u9762\u3002"}}

Model accuracy varies with the base used to encode input and output. It can be as high as $99.7\\%$ for bases $24$ and $32$, and as low as $37$ and $25\\%$ for bases $11$ and $3$. Yet, all models, no matter the base, follow a common learning pattern. As training proceeds, they learn a sequence of classes of inputs that share the same residual modulo $2^p$. Models achieve near-perfect accuracy on these classes, and less than $1\\%$ for all other inputs. This maps to a mathematical property of Collatz sequences: the length of the loops involved in the computation of a long Collatz step can be deduced from the binary representation of its input. The learning pattern reflects the model learning to predict inputs associated with increasing loop lengths. An analysis of failure cases reveals that almost all model errors follow predictable patterns. Hallucination, a common feature of large language models, almost never happens. In over $90\\%$ of failures, the model performs the correct calculation, but wrongly estimates loop lengths. Our observations give a full account of the algorithms learned by the models. They suggest that the difficulty of learning such complex arithmetic function lies in figuring the control structure of the computation -- the length of the loops.

Here, we report a counterintuitive quantum effect -- potential-barrier affinity (PBA) -- revealed by solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a crystalline potential. PBA effect drives significant interatomic electron accumulation when electron energy exceeds the barrier maximum. This effect essentially determines interatomic electron density patterns, governing microstructures and properties of condensed matters. Our theory overturns the traditional wisdom that the interstitial electron localization in electride requires potential-well constraints or hybrid orbitals, and it serves the fundamental mechanism underlying the formation of conventional chemical bonds.

This is the extended version including the appendix", "summary": "In semi-decentralized federated learning, devices primarily rely on device-to-device communication but occasionally interact with a central server. Periodically, a sampled subset of devices uploads their local models to the server, which computes an aggregate model. The server can then either (i) share this aggregate model only with the sampled clients (sampled-to-sampled, S2S) or (ii) broadcast it to all clients (sampled-to-all, S2A). Despite their practical significance, a rigorous theoretical and empirical comparison of these two strategies remains absent. We address this gap by analyzing S2S and S2A within a unified convergence framework that accounts for key system parameters: sampling rate, server aggregation frequency, and network connectivity. Our results, both analytical and experimental, reveal distinct regimes where one strategy outperforms the other, depending primarily on the degree of data heterogeneity across devices.

A similar notion, called difference flatness, exists for discrete-time systems. Although many control systems evolve in continuous time, control implementation is performed digitally, requiring discretization. It is well known in the literature that discretization does not necessarily preserve structural properties, and it has been established that, in general, flatness is not preserved under discretization (whether exact or approximate). In this paper, inspired by our previous work [1] and based on the notion of discretization maps, we construct numerical schemes that preserve flatness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\u5e73\u5766\u6027\u7684\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5e73\u5766\u6027\u662f\u63a7\u5236\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u5e73\u5766\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e00\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\u5e73\u5766\u6027\u7684\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u56fe\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\u5e73\u5766\u6027\u7684\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u6210\u529f\u5730\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\u5e73\u5766\u6027\u7684\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5e73\u5766\u6027\u4e22\u5931\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u90a3\u4e9b\u6e90\u81ea\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u5e73\u5766\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

The system processes 277 rear-end lead vehicle deceleration (LVD) collisions from the Crash Investigation Sampling System, integrating textual crash reports, structured tabular data, and visual scene diagrams. Phase I generates natural-language crash reconstructions from multimodal inputs. Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by combining these reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder (EDR).For validation, we applied it to all LVD cases, focusing on a subset of 39 complex crashes where multiple EDR records per collision introduced ambiguity (e.g., due to missing or conflicting data).The evaluation of the 39 LVD crash cases revealed our framework achieved perfect accuracy across all test cases, successfully identifying both the most relevant EDR event and correctly distinguishing striking versus struck vehicles, surpassing the 92% accuracy achieved by human researchers on the same challenging dataset.

However, existing methods often face three major challenges: unbalanced category distribution, the complexity of dynamic facial action unit time modeling, and the difficulty of feature fusion due to modal heterogeneity. With the explosive growth of multimodal data in social media scenarios, the need for building an efficient cross-modal fusion framework for emotion recognition is becoming increasingly urgent. To this end, this paper proposes Multimodal Cross-Attention Network and Contrastive Learning (MCN-CL) for multimodal emotion recognition. It uses a triple query mechanism and hard negative mining strategy to remove feature redundancy while preserving important emotional cues, effectively addressing the issues of modal heterogeneity and category imbalance.

The query complexity of these tasks is equal to the minimum number of times one must call an unknown channel to identify it within a desired threshold on the error probability. In this paper, we establish lower bounds on the query complexities of channel discrimination and estimation, in both the parallel and adaptive access models. We do so by establishing new or applying known upper bounds on the squared Bures distance and symmetric logarithmic derivative Fisher information of channels. Phrasing our statements and proofs in terms of isometric extensions of quantum channels allows us to give conceptually simple proofs for both novel and known bounds.

Accepted by AAAI 2026", "summary": "The inherent difficulty and limited scalability of collecting manipulation data using multi-fingered robot hand hardware platforms have resulted in severe data scarcity, impeding research on data-driven dexterous manipulation policy learning. To address this challenge, we present a hand-agnostic manipulation transfer system. It efficiently converts human hand manipulation sequences from demonstration videos into high-quality dexterous manipulation trajectories without requirements of massive training data. To tackle the multi-dimensional disparities between human hands and dexterous hands, as well as the challenges posed by high-degree-of-freedom coordinated control of dexterous hands, we design a progressive transfer framework: first, we establish primary control signals for dexterous hands based on kinematic matching; subsequently, we train residual policies with action space rescaling and thumb-guided initialization to dynamically optimize contact interactions under unified rewards; finally, we compute wrist control trajectories with the objective of preserving operational semantics. Using only human hand manipulation videos, our system automatically configures system parameters for different tasks, balancing kinematic matching and dynamic optimization across dexterous hands, object categories, and tasks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework can automatically generate smooth and semantically correct dexterous hand manipulation that faithfully reproduces human intentions, achieving high efficiency and strong generalizability with an average transfer success rate of 73%, providing an easily implementable and scalable method for collecting robot dexterous manipulation data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u624b\u90e8\u64cd\u4f5c\u89c6\u9891\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u591a\u6307\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u786c\u4ef6\u5e73\u53f0\u6536\u96c6\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u6709\u9650\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0e\u624b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u8f6c\u79fb\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8f6c\u79fb\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5339\u914d\u4e3a\u7075\u5de7\u624b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e3b\u8981\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u62c7\u6307\u5f15\u5bfc\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b8b\u5dee\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u5956\u52b1\u4e0b\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u63a5\u89e6\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8155\u90e8\u63a7\u5236\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u7075\u5de7\u624b\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5730\u590d\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u8f6c\u79fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e3a73%\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u6536\u96c6\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6613\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This study aims to investigate the mental workload (MWL) assessment of XoSoft, a lower-limb soft exoskeleton, using and comparing subjective and objective physiological metrics. The NASA-TLX questionnaire, the average percentage change in pupil size (APCPS), and the Baevsky stress index (SI) are compared. The experiments were conducted on 18 healthy subjects while walking and involved mathematical tasks to create a double-task condition. The results show a complex interaction between task difficulty, exoskeleton activation, and pupillary dynamics, suggesting that the subject might reach a saturated condition under a high mental load. Besides, the data indicate that pupil diameter may be an objective mental workload indicator that correlates with subjective NASA-TLX questionnaires. The discordant indications from the stress index suggest how different metrics of the ocular and cardiac levels respond differently to various stimuli and dynamics.

Presented at the AI for Financial Inclusion, Risk Modeling and Resilience in Emerging Markets workshop at ACM ICAIF 2025 Singapore", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text comprehension, but their ability to process complex, hierarchical tabular data remains underexplored. We present a novel approach to extracting structured data from multi-page government fiscal documents using LLM-based techniques. Applied to annual fiscal documents from the State of Karnataka in India (200+ pages), our method achieves high accuracy through a multi-stage pipeline that leverages domain knowledge, sequential context, and algorithmic validation. A large challenge with traditional OCR methods is the inability to verify the accurate extraction of numbers. When applied to fiscal data, the inherent structure of fiscal tables, with totals at each level of the hierarchy, allows for robust internal validation of the extracted data.

While such textures have been widely studied in two dimensions, three-dimensional (3D) systems can yield more complex configurations, resulting in richer topologies and dynamic behaviors. However, reliably nucleating these 3D textures has proven challenging, and so far, 3D configurations such as vortex rings and hopfions can often only be observed forming spontaneously in relatively uncontrolled manners. Here, we demonstrate that through the 3D nanopatterning of chiral single crystal helimagnets into nano-tori, the controlled formation of a magnetic double helix can be achieved. This surface-localized topological state is stabilized by the interplay of intrinsic exchange interactions of the single crystal with the extrinsic emergent effects of the patterned geometry. These double helices host magnetic defects akin to supercoiling in circular DNA and climbing vines. We expect this study to serve as a foundation for future research combining single crystal systems with 3D nanopatterning, offering a new degree of control over emergent phenomena in nanoscale magnets and wider quantum material systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e09\u7ef4\u7eb3\u7c73\u52a0\u5de5\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u63a7\u5730\u5f62\u6210\u78c1\u6027\u53cc\u87ba\u65cb\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e09\u7ef4\u78c1\u6027\u6784\u578b\u56e0\u5176\u590d\u6742\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e94\u7528\u800c\u5907\u53d7\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u5236\u9020\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u624b\u6027\u5355\u6676\u87ba\u65cb\u78c1\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u4e09\u7ef4\u7eb3\u7c73\u52a0\u5de5\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5236\u6210\u7eb3\u7c73\u73af\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8868\u9762\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u53cc\u87ba\u65cb\u62d3\u6251\u6001\uff0c\u8be5\u72b6\u6001\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u6362\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u5f97\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7ed3\u5408\u5355\u6676\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u4e09\u7ef4\u7eb3\u7c73\u52a0\u5de5\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5728\u7eb3\u7c73\u78c1\u4f53\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6750\u6599\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6d8c\u73b0\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

All transition-metal moments saturate below 1 T, while the rare-earth moments do not saturate even at 5 T, consistent with van Vleck paramagnetic contributions and crystal field suppression. While the sum rules are widely used to extract element-specific magnetic moments from XMCD, we show that for 3d transition metals, their application requires accurate estimates of the number of unoccupied 3d states. We observe a finite magnetic moment on Ni, challenging the common assumption of its nonmagnetic character in Laves phases. The orbital magnetic moments were determined using the spin rules, while the spin moments were estimated from single-ion values from multiplet calculations, due to the invalidity of the spin sum rule for light rare-earth elements. The magnetic moments of Nd and Pr are found to be suppressed relative to their free-ion values, with multiplet theory indicating that this is due to crystal field effects. Our results confirm that Nd and Pr maintain localized 4f3 and 4f2 configurations, respectively, and that their element-specific magnetic moments are robust to rare-earth substitution. Ce, on the other hand, exhibits a tunable mixed-valent ground state with both magnetic 4f1 and nonmagnetic 4f0 components. The relative fraction of these states varies with the electronegativity of the surrounding 3d transition metals, revealing a pathway to tune Ce magnetism via composition.

We demonstrate the capabilities of the platform through a case study on the flooding-related risk in Jacksonville, Florida, showing how it allows users to explore, generate, and evaluate regionalization interactively, combining computational rigor with user-driven decision making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u9762\u5411\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u707e\u5bb3\u89c4\u5212\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u89c4\u5212\u5355\u5143\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5355\u5143\uff08\u5982\u666e\u67e5\u533a\u3001\u90ae\u653f\u7f16\u7801\u6216\u793e\u533a\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5f53\u5730\u793e\u533a\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5b9e\u65bd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u707e\u5bb3\u9884\u9632\u6216\u54cd\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u65b9\u9762\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6620\u5c04\uff08RepSC-SOM\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7528\u6237\u5728\u707e\u5bb3\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u9762\u5411\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u533a\u57df\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684SOM\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u7406\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u533a\u57df\u751f\u957f\u7ec6\u5316\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u7528\u6237\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4f5b\u7f57\u91cc\u8fbe\u5dde\u6770\u514b\u900a\u7ef4\u5c14\u5e02\u8fdb\u884c\u6d2a\u6c34\u98ce\u9669\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u5e73\u53f0\u80fd\u591f\u8ba9\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5730\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u533a\u57df\u5212\u5206\uff0c\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7528\u6237\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4e3a\u521b\u5efa\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u9762\u5411\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5355\u5143\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u707e\u5bb3\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Accepted by EMNLP 2025. Code and additional details are available at: https://qihang-zhang.com/Learning-Sys-Blog/2025/10/15/weighted-product-of-experts.html", "summary": "Lossless compression techniques are crucial in an era of rapidly growing data. Traditional universal compressors like gzip offer low computational overhead, high speed, and broad applicability across data distributions. However, they often lead to worse compression rates than modern neural compressors, which leverage large-scale training data to model data distributions more effectively. Despite their advantages, neural compressors struggle to generalize to unseen data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that performs Test-Time Steering via a Weighted Product of Experts (wPoE). At inference, our method adaptively combines a universal compression model with a pretrained neural language model, ensuring the compression rate is at least as good as that of the best individual model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of text compression without requiring fine-tuning.

Here, first-principles calculations are used to contrast the thermal transport in covalent zincblende (zb) and metavalent rocksalt (rs) BeO. We find that the metavalent bonding in rs-BeO enhances lattice anharmonicity, activating multi-phonon scattering channels and suppressing phonon transport. This results in an ultralow $\u03ba_L$ of 24 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ at 300 K, starkly contrasting with the zb phase (357 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$). Accurately modeling such strongly anharmonic systems requires explicit inclusion of temperature-dependent phonon renormalization and four-phonon scattering.

However, monitoring is still often performed manually due to the lack of suitable algorithmic methods and data. This paper introduces a high-fidelity, physics-enhanced simulator of a three-pump wastewater station that captures transient hydro-mechanical dynamics at a one-second resolution. The simulator is fully parameter-driven, adaptable to other wastewater stations, and capable of generating datasets for data-driven analytics. It can also generate balanced faulty datasets when real failures are scarce or confidential. A comparison with high-frequency SCADA data from a municipal station shows strong agreement across key operational metrics. Furthermore, the paper proposes robust statistical and mathematical frameworks for fault detection and isolation, including a nested-model F-test to detect pump degradation or system faults, and a tangent residual approach to distinguish pump faults from system faults using operating-point kinematics. This framework enables what-if studies, facilitates early fault diagnosis based on flow rate and head, and provides actionable insights for condition-based maintenance in wastewater pumping infrastructure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u7269\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5e9f\u6c34\u6cf5\u7ad9\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u4e00\u79d2\u7684\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6355\u6349\u77ac\u6001\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u9694\u79bb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u3002", "motivation": "\u76d1\u6d4b\u5e9f\u6c34\u6cf5\u7ad9\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u662f\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5408\u9002\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u76d1\u6d4b\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u624b\u52a8\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u7269\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5e9f\u6c34\u6cf5\u7ad9\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u77ac\u6001\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5305\u62ec\u5d4c\u5957\u6a21\u578bF\u68c0\u9a8c\u548c\u5207\u7ebf\u6b8b\u5dee\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5185\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u9694\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645SCADA\u6570\u636e\u5728\u5173\u952e\u8fd0\u884c\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u5047\u8bbe\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u91cf\u548c\u626c\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548c\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5e9f\u6c34\u6cf5\u7ad9\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Alexander"], "title": "LLM enhanced graph inference for long-term disease progression modelling", "comment": null, "summary": "Understanding the interactions between biomarkers among brain regions during neurodegenerative disease is essential for unravelling the mechanisms underlying disease progression. For example, pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically describe how variables, such as regional levels of toxic proteins, interact spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying biological substrate, often based on brain connectivity. However, current methods grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality brain connectome as the disease-spreading substrate. This leads to inaccurate predictions of pathology spread, especially during the long-term progression period. Meanhwile, other methods of learning such a graph in a purely data-driven way face the identifiability issue due to lack of proper constraint. We thus present a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert guides on the interaction of regional variables to enhance learning of disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal patient data. By leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms, our method simultaneously optimizes 1) the construction of long-term disease trajectories from individual-level observations and 2) the biologically-constrained graph structure that captures interactions among brain regions with better identifiability. We demonstrate the new approach by estimating the pathology propagation using tau-PET imaging data from an Alzheimer's disease cohort. The new framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches while revealing additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity measures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u81f4\u75c5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u4ece\u4e2a\u4f53\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u957f\u671f\u75be\u75c5\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee5\u53ca\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u8fa8\u8bc6\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7 tau-PET \u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u4f30\u8ba1\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\uff08AD\uff09\u7684\u75c5\u7406\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9664\u4f20\u7edf\u8fde\u63a5\u7ec4\u5b66\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u81f4\u75c5\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u4e2d\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u5728\u8111\u533a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63ed\u793a\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u673a\u5236\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u4f20\u64ad\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u8111\u8fde\u63a5\u7ec4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u957f\u671f\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u800c\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u8fa8\u8bc6\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u81f4\u75c5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u75be\u75c5\u8f68\u8ff9\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8fa8\u8bc6\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7 tau-PET \u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u4f30\u8ba1\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\uff08AD\uff09\u7684\u75c5\u7406\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9664\u4f20\u7edf\u8fde\u63a5\u7ec4\u5b66\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u81f4\u75c5\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u65b0\u7684\u81f4\u75c5\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Accepted for publication in the Journal of Information Systems Engineering and Management", "summary": "Object detection using images or videos captured by drones is a promising technology with significant potential across various industries. However, a major challenge is that drone images are typically taken from high altitudes, making object identification difficult. This paper proposes an effective solution to address this issue. The base model used in the experiments is YOLOv11, the latest object detection model, with a specific implementation based on YOLOv11n. The experimental data were sourced from the widely used and reliable VisDrone dataset, a standard benchmark in drone-based object detection. This paper introduces an enhancement to the Head network of the YOLOv11 algorithm, called the GhostHead Network. The model incorporating this improvement is named YOLO-Drone. Experimental results demonstrate that YOLO-Drone achieves significant improvements in key detection accuracy metrics, including Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and mAP (0.5), compared to the original YOLOv11. Specifically, the proposed model recorded a 0.4% increase in Precision, a 0.6% increase in Recall, a 0.5% increase in F1-Score, and a 0.5% increase in mAP (0.5). Additionally, the Inference Speed metric, which measures image processing speed, also showed a notable improvement.

In contrast, world models that capture environmental dynamics in latent space have opened up new perspectives for navigation tasks, enabling systems to move beyond traditional multi-module pipelines. However, world model often suffers from high computational costs in both training and inference. To address this, we propose LS-NWM - a lightweight latent space navigation world model that is trained and operates entirely in latent space, compared to the state-of-the-art baseline, our method reduces training time by approximately 3.2x and planning time by about 447x,while further improving navigation performance with a 35% higher SR and an 11% higher SPL. The key idea is that accurate pixel-wise environmental prediction is unnecessary for navigation. Instead, the model predicts future latent states based on current observational features and action inputs, then performs path planning and decision-making within this compact representation, significantly improving computational efficiency. By incorporating an autoregressive multi-frame prediction strategy during training, the model effectively captures long-term spatiotemporal dependencies, thereby enhancing navigation performance in complex scenarios.

Such evaluations often rely on a curated benchmark set of input prompts provided to the LLM, where the output for each prompt may be assessed in a binary fashion (e.g., harmful/non-harmful or does not leak/leaks sensitive information), and the aggregation of binary scores is used to evaluate the LLM. However, existing approaches to evaluation often neglect statistical uncertainty quantification. With an applied statistics audience in mind, we provide background on LLM text generation and evaluation, and then describe a Bayesian approach for quantifying uncertainty in binary evaluation metrics. We focus in particular on uncertainty that is induced by the probabilistic text generation strategies typically deployed in LLM-based systems. We present two case studies applying this approach: 1) evaluating refusal rates on a benchmark of adversarial inputs designed to elicit harmful responses, and 2) evaluating pairwise preferences of one LLM over another on a benchmark of open-ended interactive dialogue examples. We demonstrate how the Bayesian approach can provide useful uncertainty quantification about the behavior of LLM-based systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u7531LLM\u7684\u6982\u7387\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u4e8c\u5143\u8bc4\u5206\u805a\u5408\uff09\u5e38\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u7406\u89e3LLM\uff08\u5982\u751f\u6210\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u6216\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff09\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u4e8c\u5143\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u8003\u8651LLM\u7684\u6982\u7387\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff08\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6709\u5bb3\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u7387\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2dLLM\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u504f\u597d\uff09\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u7528\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4e3aLLM\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u7528\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3002"}}

However, the ARPES fingerprint of charged excitons (trions), which plays a key role in all doped and gated 2D material systems, has remained unknown so far. We present a first theoretical analysis of trion signatures in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides, highlighting how the additional charge carrier modifies the spectral position and shape relative to neutral excitons in ARPES spectra. Interestingly, we further predict that mass-imbalanced trions yield a characteristic double-peak structure, clearly separated in energy and line shape from neutral excitons. The predicted temperature dependence of these features offers guidance for experimental investigations aimed at identifying trionic states, thereby establishing a framework for ARPES studies of many-body Coulomb complexes in doped two-dimensional semiconductors.", "AI": {"tldr": "ARPES\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u4e8c\u7ef4\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u6fc0\u5b50\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u5e26\u7535\u6fc0\u5b50\uff08\u4e09\u4f53\u6fc0\u5b50\uff09\u3002\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u5355\u5c42\u8fc7\u6e21\u91d1\u5c5e\u786b\u65cf\u5316\u5408\u7269\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u4f53\u6fc0\u5b50\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u5176\u5728ARPES\u8c31\u4e2d\u4e0e\u4e2d\u6027\u6fc0\u5b50\u7684\u533a\u522b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6e29\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e26\u7535\u6fc0\u5b50\uff08\u4e09\u4f53\u6fc0\u5b50\uff09\u5728\u6240\u6709\u63ba\u6742\u548c\u95e8\u63a7\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6750\u6599\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u90fd\u8d77\u7740\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728ARPES\uff08\u89d2\u5206\u8fa8\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u8c31\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u7279\u5f81\u4ecd\u7136\u672a\u77e5\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u5355\u5c42\u8fc7\u6e21\u91d1\u5c5e\u786b\u65cf\u5316\u5408\u7269\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u4f53\u6fc0\u5b50\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u5176\u5728ARPES\u8c31\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u5355\u5c42\u8fc7\u6e21\u91d1\u5c5e\u786b\u65cf\u5316\u5408\u7269\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u4f53\u6fc0\u5b50\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u989d\u5916\u7684\u8f7d\u6d41\u5b50\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u53d8\u6fc0\u5b50\u5728ARPES\u8c31\u4e2d\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u4e09\u4f53\u6fc0\u5b50\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u7279\u5f81\u6027\u7684\u53cc\u5cf0\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e0e\u4e2d\u6027\u6fc0\u5b50\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5e26\u7535\u6fc0\u5b50\uff08\u4e09\u4f53\u6fc0\u5b50\uff09\u5728ARPES\u8c31\u4e2d\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u4f1a\u53d1\u751f\u6539\u53d8\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5730\uff0c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u4e09\u4f53\u6fc0\u5b50\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0e\u4e2d\u6027\u6fc0\u5b50\u5728\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u7ebf\u578b\u4e0a\u660e\u663e\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u53cc\u5cf0\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u5355\u5c42\u8fc7\u6e21\u91d1\u5c5e\u786b\u65cf\u5316\u5408\u7269\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u4f53\u6fc0\u5b50\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9996\u6b21\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u5176\u5728ARPES\u8c31\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4e09\u4f53\u6fc0\u5b50\u72ec\u7279iti\u00e9\u53cc\u5cf0\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u5176\u6e29\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e09\u4f53\u6fc0\u5b50\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3aARPES\u7814\u7a76\u63ba\u6742\u4e8c\u7ef4\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u4f53\u5e93\u4ed1\u590d\u5408\u7269\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Reddy"], "title": "SURFACEBENCH: Can Self-Evolving LLMs Find the Equations of 3D Scientific Surfaces?", "comment": null, "summary": "Equation discovery from data is a core challenge in machine learning for science, requiring the recovery of concise symbolic expressions that govern complex physical and geometric phenomena. Recent approaches with large language models (LLMs) show promise in symbolic regression, but their success often hinges on memorized formulas or overly simplified functional forms. Existing benchmarks exacerbate this limitation: they focus on scalar functions, ignore domain grounding, and rely on brittle string-matching based metrics that fail to capture scientific equivalence. We introduce SurfaceBench, first comprehensive benchmark for symbolic surface discovery. SurfaceBench comprises 183 tasks across 15 categories of symbolic complexity, spanning explicit, implicit, and parametric equation representation forms. Each task includes ground-truth equations, variable semantics, and synthetically sampled three dimensional data. Unlike prior SR datasets, our tasks reflect surface-level structure, resist LLM memorization through novel symbolic compositions, and are grounded in scientific domains such as fluid dynamics, robotics, electromagnetics, and geometry. To evaluate equation discovery quality, we pair symbolic checks with geometry-aware metrics such as Chamfer and Hausdorff distances, capturing both algebraic fidelity and spatial reconstruction accuracy. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art frameworks, while occasionally successful on specific families, struggle to generalize across representation types and surface complexities. SurfaceBench thus establishes a challenging and diagnostic testbed that bridges symbolic reasoning with geometric reconstruction, enabling principled benchmarking of progress in compositional generalization, data-driven scientific induction, and geometry-aware reasoning with LLMs. We release the code here: https://github.com/Sanchit-404/surfacebench", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SurfaceBench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b183\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u8868\u9762\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u7a0b\u8868\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0cSurfaceBench\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdbLLM\u5728\u8fd9\u4e00\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u9762\u867d\u7136\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6210\u529f\u5f80\u5f80\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6216\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u5728\u4e8e\u5b83\u4eec\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6807\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u9886\u57df\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5339\u914d\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0a\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SurfaceBench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u8868\u9762\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b15\u4e2a\u7c7b\u522b\u5171183\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u6db5\u76d6\u663e\u5f0f\u3001\u9690\u5f0f\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u7a0b\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u8868\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u80cc\u666f\uff08\u5982\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u3001\u7535\u78c1\u5b66\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u5b66\uff09\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u7b26\u53f7\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982Chamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\u548cHausdorff\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u8861\u91cf\u4ee3\u6570\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u91cd\u6784\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5904\u7406SurfaceBench\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u5076\u5c14\u53d6\u5f97\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8de8\u8d8a\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u793a\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u8868\u9762\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6323\u624e\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u5728\u65b9\u7a0b\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u5f52\u7eb3\u4ee5\u53caLLM\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "SurfaceBench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4e14\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u91cd\u6784\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u63a8\u52a8LLM\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b\u53d1\u73b0\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8868\u9762\u53d1\u73b0\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cSurfaceBench\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u5728\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

In this article, we report on strong second and third-order nonlinear optical responses in visible and terahertz (THz) light in single crystals of the noble metal dichalcogenide PdTe2. We find that buried conduction and valence topological surface states of PdTe2 lead to resonant enhancement of optical second-harmonic generation. On the other hand, although the nonlinear responses obtained with THz excitation are not close to this resonance, they can be clearly observed in reflection geometry, even in the presence of broadband excitation, where optical filters are not necessary to observe the odd-order higher harmonic gain. By carefully considering the radiative photocurrent framework of stimulated THz emission, we are able to extract fingerprints of both second- and third-order processes in the THz regime, and show that PdTe2 is a promising material candidate for radio frequency rectification, frequency mixing, and beam focusing.", "AI": {"tldr": "PdTe2\u6676\u4f53\u5728\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u548c\u592a\u8d6b\u5179\u5149\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u548c\u4e09\u9636\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5149\u5b66\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u62d3\u6251\u8868\u9762\u6001\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e8c\u6b21\u8c10\u6ce2\u4ea7\u751f\u5171\u632f\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u800c\u592a\u8d6b\u5179\u6fc0\u53d1\u4e0b\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\u5219\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u8f90\u5c04\u5149\u7535\u6d41\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u53d6\u4e8c\u9636\u548c\u4e09\u9636\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8fc7\u7a0b\u514b\u670d\u73b0\u4ee3\u6210\u50cf\u3001\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u9891\u7387\u6df7\u5408\u8bbe\u5907\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86PdTe2\u5355\u6676\u5728\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u548c\u592a\u8d6b\u5179\u5149\u4e0b\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5149\u5b66\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e8c\u6b21\u8c10\u6ce2\u4ea7\u751f\u548c\u592a\u8d6b\u5179\u6fc0\u53d1\u4e0b\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8f90\u5c04\u5149\u7535\u6d41\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u4e0b\uff0cPdTe2\u6676\u4f53\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u8868\u9762\u6001\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e8c\u6b21\u8c10\u6ce2\u4ea7\u751f\u5171\u632f\u589e\u5f3a\u3002\u5728\u592a\u8d6b\u5179\u5149\u4e0b\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e86\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u53d6\u4e86\u4e8c\u9636\u548c\u4e09\u9636\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "PdTe2\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5c04\u9891\u6574\u6d41\u3001\u9891\u7387\u6df7\u5408\u548c\u6ce2\u675f\u805a\u7126\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

While challenges remain in ambiguous scenarios, these results show that domain specialization and coordinated reasoning can meaningfully improve legal AI performance, providing a scalable and regulation-aware framework for trustworthy and interpretable automated compliance verification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u4efb\u52a1\u5230\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff08\u5982\u6cd5\u5f8b\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u4e1a\u52a1\u80cc\u666f\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7efc\u5408\u534f\u8bae\u8fdb\u884c\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u65e5\u76ca\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u65e5\u672c\u300a\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u62a4\u6cd5\u300b\uff08APPI\uff09\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\uff08\u5982APPI\uff09\u7684\u65e5\u76ca\u4e25\u683c\uff0c\u5728AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7efc\u5408\u534f\u8bae\u8fdb\u884c\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u6cd5\u5b9a\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u4e1a\u52a1\u80cc\u666f\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728200\u4e2a\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684APPI\u7b2c16\u6761\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8672%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6bd4\u5355\u4e00\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8621\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002\u5728\u6e05\u6670\u5408\u89c4\u6848\u4f8b\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523090%\uff08\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e3a16%\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5b8c\u7f8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u51fa\u660e\u786e\u7684\u8fdd\u89c4\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u6cd5\u5f8bAI\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5408\u89c4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u6cd5\u89c4\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Recent methods based on submodular subset selection have achieved high faithfulness, but their efficiency limitations hinder practical deployment in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose PhaseWin, a novel phase-window search algorithm that enables faithful region attribution with near-linear complexity. PhaseWin replaces traditional quadratic-cost greedy selection with a phased coarse-to-fine search, combining adaptive pruning, windowed fine-grained selection, and dynamic supervision mechanisms to closely approximate greedy behavior while dramatically reducing model evaluations. Theoretically, PhaseWin retains near-greedy approximation guarantees under mild monotone submodular assumptions. Empirically, PhaseWin achieves over 95% of greedy attribution faithfulness using only 20% of the computational budget, and consistently outperforms other attribution baselines across object detection and visual grounding tasks with Grounding DINO and Florence-2.

To illuminate this phenomenon, we study an ensemble of two-level systems (TLS) and establish its associated nonlinear quantum master equation, for which self-consistent analytical solutions of quantum synchronization can be obtained. The trajectories on the Bloch sphere vividly illustrate how dissipation and interaction drive the system toward a synchronized state. We present a phase diagram for macroscopic synchronization as a function of interaction strength and the gain-to-damping ratio.

By activating pinching antennas (PAs) near both receivers and flexibly adjusting PAs' power radiation ratios, both energy harvesting efficiency and communication quality can be enhanced. A bi-level optimization problem is formulated to overcome the strong coupling between optimization variables. The upper level jointly optimizes transmit beamforming, PA positions, and feasible interval of power radiation ratios for power conversion efficiency (PCE) maximization under rate requirements, while the lower level refines power radiation ratio for the sum rate maximization. Efficient solutions are developed for both two-user and multi-user scenarios. 1) For the two-user case, where an EHR and an IDR coexist, the alternating optimization (AO)-based and weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE)-based algorithms are developed to achieve the stationary solutions of transmit beamforming, PA positions, and power radiation ratios. 2) For the multi-user case, a quadratic transform-Lagrangian dual transform (QT-LDT) algorithm is proposed to iteratively update PCE and sum rate by optimizing PA positions and power radiation ratios individually. Closed-form solutions are derived for both maximization problems. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PASS-WPT framework significantly outperforms conventional MIMO and the baseline PASS with fixed power radiation, which demonstrates that: i) Compared to the conventional MIMO and baseline PASS, the proposed PASS-WPT framework achieves 81.45% and 43.19% improvements in PCE of EHRs, and ii) also increases the sum rate by 77.81% and 31.91% for IDRs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u80fd\u91cf\u6536\u96c6\uff08EHR\uff09\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u89e3\u7801\uff08IDR\uff09\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u80fd\u91cf\u4f20\u8f93\uff08WPT\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08PASS\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u634f\u5408\u5929\u7ebf\uff08PA\uff09\u7684\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u80fd\u91cf\u6536\u96c6\u6548\u7387\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u65e0\u7ebf\u80fd\u91cf\u4f20\u8f93\uff08WPT\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u80fd\u91cf\u6536\u96c6\u63a5\u6536\u5668\uff08EHRs\uff09\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u89e3\u7801\u63a5\u6536\u5668\uff08IDRs\uff09\u5171\u5b58\u65f6\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u80fd\u91cf\u6536\u96c6\u6548\u7387\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u8d28\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u8fd9\u4e24\u8005\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u80fd\u91cf\u6536\u96c6\uff08EHR\uff09\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u89e3\u7801\uff08IDR\uff09\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u80fd\u91cf\u4f20\u8f93\uff08WPT\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08PASS\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u634f\u5408\u5929\u7ebf\uff08PA\uff09\u7684\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e0a\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u529f\u7387\u8f6c\u6362\u6548\u7387\uff08PCE\uff09\uff0c\u4e0b\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u901f\u7387\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u4e24\u7528\u6237\u548c\u591a\u7528\u6237\u573a\u666f\u7684\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\uff08AO\uff09\u3001\u52a0\u6743\u6700\u5c0f\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\uff08WMMSE\uff09\u548c\u4e8c\u6b21\u53d8\u6362-\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u5bf9\u5076\u53d8\u6362\uff08QT-LDT\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u7528\u6237\u548c\u591a\u7528\u6237\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684PASS-WPT\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684MIMO\u548c\u57fa\u7ebfPASS\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u5728PCE\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8681.45%\u548c43.19%\uff1b\u5728\u548c\u901f\u7387\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8677.81%\u548c31.91%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684PASS-WPT\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3EHRs\u548cIDRs\u5171\u5b58\u7684WPT\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6536\u96c6\u6548\u7387\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316PA\u7684\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

While Ti and Cu are among the most extensively studied light nonmagnetic metals (NMs) for OT devices, theoretical calculations of the resulting torque have remained limited. Here, we present a systematic and quantitative theoretical study of current-induced torques in Ti/FM and Cu/FM (FM = Co, Ni) bilayers using semi-realistic tight-binding models derived from ab initio electronic structures. We find that the torque in Ti/FM is larger for Ni than for Co, but this trend does not necessarily hold in Cu/FM, revealing that the FM dependence of OT is not universal but varies with the orbital current source. Moreover, the dependence of OT on NM thickness clearly indicates its NM bulk origin in both Ti- and Cu-based systems. Notwithstanding, the quantitative characteristics of OT cannot be explained by a simplified picture based on the individual bulk properties of the NM or FM layers.

Despite extensive training, these systems will inevitably encounter scenarios where no available course of action fully satisfies all operational constraints (e.g., operating procedures, rules, laws, norms, and goals). To achieve goals in accordance with human expectations and values, agents must go beyond their trained policies and instead construct, evaluate, and justify candidate courses of action. These processes require contextual \"knowledge\" that may lie outside prior (policy) training. This paper characterizes requirements for agent decision making in these contexts.

Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable OOD detection performance by integrating both visual and textual modalities. In this context, negative prompts are introduced to emphasize the dissimilarity between image features and prompt content. However, these prompts often include a broad range of non-ID features, which may result in suboptimal outcomes due to the capture of overlapping or misleading information. To address this issue, we propose Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision, which encourages negative prompts to capture inter-class features and transfers this semantic knowledge to the visual modality to enhance OOD detection performance. Our method begins with class-specific positive and negative prompts initialized by large language models (LLMs). These prompts are subsequently optimized, with positive prompts focusing on features within each class, while negative prompts highlight features around category boundaries. Additionally, a graph-based architecture is employed to aggregate semantic-aware supervision from the optimized prompt representations and propagate it to the visual branch, thereby enhancing the performance of the energy-based OOD detector. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K, across eight OOD datasets and five different LLMs, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u201c\u6b63\u8d1f\u63d0\u793a\u76d1\u7763\u201d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u6b63\u8d1f\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u6001\u7684OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7684OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5229\u7528\u8d1f\u9762\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u4e3a\u8d1f\u9762\u63d0\u793a\u5305\u542b\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5f81\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u91cd\u53e0\u6216\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528LLM\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6b63\u8d1f\u63d0\u793a\u3002\n2. \u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u6b63\u5411\u63d0\u793a\u5173\u6ce8\u7c7b\u522b\u5185\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8d1f\u5411\u63d0\u793a\u5173\u6ce8\u7c7b\u522b\u8fb9\u754c\u7279\u5f81\u3002\n3. \u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u805a\u5408\u6765\u81ea\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4f20\u9012\u7ed9\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u652f\u3002\n4. \u5229\u7528\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u7684OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-100\u548cImageNet-1K\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u516b\u4e2aOOD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e94\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u201c\u6b63\u8d1f\u63d0\u793a\u76d1\u7763\u201d\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5bfc\u8d1f\u9762\u63d0\u793a\u6355\u6349\u7c7b\u522b\u8fb9\u754c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u5347\u4e86OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, enabling a unified framework that generalizes across different tasks, objects, and environments while seamlessly integrating non-prehensile and prehensile (P) actions remains challenging: robots must determine when to invoke NP skills, select the appropriate primitive for each context, and compose P and NP strategies into robust, multi-step plans. We introduce ApaptPNP, a vision-language model (VLM)-empowered task and motion planning framework that systematically selects and combines P and NP skills to accomplish diverse manipulation objectives. Our approach leverages a VLM to interpret visual scene observations and textual task descriptions, generating a high-level plan skeleton that prescribes the sequence and coordination of P and NP actions. A digital-twin based object-centric intermediate layer predicts desired object poses, enabling proactive mental rehearsal of manipulation sequences. Finally, a control module synthesizes low-level robot commands, with continuous execution feedback enabling online task plan refinement and adaptive replanning through the VLM. We evaluate ApaptPNP across representative P&NP hybrid manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world environments.

To construct the SynthSoM-Twin dataset, we propose a new framework that can extend the quantity and missing modality of existing real-world multi-modal sensing-communication dataset. Specifically, we exploit multi-modal sensing-assisted object detection and tracking algorithms to ensure spatio-temporal consistency of static objects and dynamic objects across real world and simulation environments. The constructed scenario is imported into three high-fidelity simulators, i.e., AirSim, WaveFarer, and Sionna RT. The SynthSoM-Twin dataset contains spatio-temporally consistent data with the real world, including 66,868 snapshots of synthetic RGB images, depth maps, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds, millimeter wave (mmWave) radar point clouds, and large-scale and small-scale channel fading data. To validate the utility of SynthSoM-Twin dataset, we conduct Sim2Real transfer investigation by implementing two cross-modal downstream tasks via cross-modal generative models (CMGMs), i.e., cross-modal channel generation model and multi-modal sensing-assisted beam generation model. Based on the downstream tasks, we explore the threshold of real-world data injection that can achieve a decent trade-off between real-world data usage and models' practical performance. Experimental results show that the model training on the SynthSoM-Twin dataset achieves a decent practical performance, and the injection of real-world data further facilitates Sim2Real transferability. Based on the SynthSoM-Twin dataset, injecting less than 15% of real-world data can achieve similar and even better performance compared to that trained with all the real-world data only.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aSynthSoM-Twin\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f-\u901a\u4fe1\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u8054\u89c9\uff08SoM\uff09\u8fdb\u884cSim2Real\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u73b0\u6709\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f-\u901a\u4fe1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u8c61\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002SynthSoM-Twin\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b66,868\u4e2a\u5408\u6210RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u3001\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u70b9\u4e91\u3001\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u96f7\u8fbe\u70b9\u4e91\u4ee5\u53ca\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u4fe1\u9053\u8870\u843d\u6570\u636e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65bd\u4e24\u79cd\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u8f85\u52a9\u6ce2\u675f\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86Sim2Real\u8fc1\u79fb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6548\u7528\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728SynthSoM-Twin\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6ce8\u5165\u5c11\u91cf\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5c11\u4e8e15%\uff09\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u90e8\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f8\u4f3c\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e0a\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f-\u901a\u4fe1\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08SynthSoM-Twin\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u8054\u89c9\uff08SoM\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0Sim2Real\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u573a\u666f\u5bfc\u5165AirSim\u3001WaveFarer\u548cSionna RT\u4e09\u4e2a\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u3002\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b\u5408\u6210RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u3001\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u70b9\u4e91\u3001\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u96f7\u8fbe\u70b9\u4e91\u4ee5\u53ca\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u4fe1\u9053\u8870\u843d\u6570\u636e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08CMGMs\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u901a\u9053\u751f\u6210\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u8f85\u52a9\u6ce2\u675f\u751f\u6210\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8fdb\u884cSim2Real\u8fc1\u79fb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u6ce8\u5165\u7684\u9608\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u5728SynthSoM-Twin\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6ce8\u5165\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4fc3\u8fdbSim2Real\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6ce8\u5165\u5c11\u4e8e15%\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u90e8\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f8\u4f3c\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SynthSoM-Twin\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u652f\u6301Sim2Real\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

We show that even meaning-preserving paraphrases can cause large fluctuations in safety scores, revealing a lack of semantic grounding. To address this, we introduce a practical, self-supervised framework for improving the semantic robustness of guard models. Our method leverages paraphrase sets to enforce prediction consistency using a novel, skew-aware aggregation strategy for robust target computation. Notably, we find that standard aggregation methods like mean and median can degrade safety, underscoring the need for skew-aware alternatives. We analyze six open-source guard models and show that our approach reduces semantic variability across paraphrases by ~58%, improves benchmark accuracy by ~2.5% on average, and generalizes to unseen stylistic variations. Intriguingly, we discover a bidirectional relationship between model calibration and consistency: our robustness training improves calibration by up to 40%, revealing a fundamental connection between these properties. These results highlight the value of treating semantic consistency as a first-class training objective and provide a scalable recipe for building more reliable guard models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u5b88\u536b\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5b88\u536b\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7ec6\u5fae\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u53d8\u5316\u5f88\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u91ca\u4e49\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u5206\u5927\u5e45\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u5b83\u4eec\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u3001\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u91ca\u4e49\u96c6\u6765\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u3001\u504f\u659c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u9c81\u68d2\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u91ca\u4e49\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7ea658%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7ea62.5%\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u6821\u51c6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8640%\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5e94\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5b88\u536b\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To automate this process, large datasets are required for testing and training autotuning algorithms. To address the demand for such large datasets, we introduce RF-Squad, a physics-based simulator designed to realistically replicate radiofrequency (RF) reflectometry measurements of quantum dot arrays, with the ability to go beyond the Constant Interaction Model (CIM) and simulate physical phenomena such as tunnel coupling, tunnel rates, and quantum confinement. Implemented in JAX, an accelerated linear algebra library, RF-Squad achieves high computational speed, enabling the simulation of a 100x100 pixel charge stability diagram of a double quantum dot (DQD) in 52.1 $\\pm$0.2 milliseconds at the CIM level.

While prior works have proposed confidence representation methods for hallucination detection, most of these approaches rely on computationally expensive sampling strategies and often disregard the distinction between hallucination types. In this work, we introduce a principled evaluation framework that differentiates between extrinsic and intrinsic hallucination categories and evaluates detection performance across a suite of curated benchmarks. In addition, we leverage a recent attention-based uncertainty quantification algorithm and propose novel attention aggregation strategies that improve both interpretability and hallucination detection performance. Our experimental findings reveal that sampling-based methods like Semantic Entropy are effective for detecting extrinsic hallucinations but generally fail on intrinsic ones. In contrast, our method, which aggregates attention over input tokens, is better suited for intrinsic hallucinations. These insights provide new directions for aligning detection strategies with the nature of hallucination and highlight attention as a rich signal for quantifying model uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Fully leveraging AI agents, however, requires tightly coupled, collaborative workflows spanning hypothesis generation, experimental planning, execution, and interpretation. To address this, we develop and deploy a human-AI collaborative (HAIC) workflow that integrates large language models for hypothesis generation and analysis, with collaborative policy updates driving autonomous pulsed laser deposition (PLD) experiments for remote epitaxy of BaTiO$_3$/graphene. HAIC accelerated the hypothesis formation and experimental design and efficiently mapped the growth space to graphene-damage. In situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that chemistry drives degradation while the highest energy plume components seed defects, identifying a low-O$_2$ pressure low-temperature synthesis window that preserves graphene but is incompatible with optimal BaTiO$_3$ growth. Thus, we show a two-step Ar/O$_2$ deposition is required to exfoliate ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$ while maintaining a monolayer graphene interlayer.

Most existing studies evaluate these algorithms under the assumption of homogeneous platoons, i.e., when all platoon members adopt the same CACC. However, market competition is likely to result in vehicles from different manufacturers implementing distinct CACCs. This raises fundamental questions about whether heterogeneous vehicles can safely cooperate within a platoon and what performance can be achieved. To date, these questions have received little attention, as heterogeneous platoons are difficult to model and analyze. In this work, we introduce the concept of mixed platoons, i.e., platoons made of vehicles running heterogeneous CACCs, and we study their performance through simulation-based experiments. We consider mixtures of three well-established CACCs from the literature. In the first part of the paper, we study a single mixed platoon in isolation to understand the microscopic effects on safety: we evaluate the performance of various CACC-mixtures across speed change and emergency braking scenarios. In the second part, we examine a high-density ring-road scenario to assess macroscopic impacts on safety, comfort, and traffic throughput, especially comparing throughput results with those obtained from vehicles controlled by a standard Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) or by human drivers. Our findings highlight that some combinations of CACCs can operate robustly and safely, while others exhibit critical limitations in safety, comfort, or efficiency. These results emphasize the need for careful system design and the development of theoretical frameworks for modeling heterogeneous platoons.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f02\u6784\u8f66\u8f86\u5408\u4f5c\u7684CACC\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u4e0d\u540cCACC\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7f16\u961f\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u540c\u8d28\u7f16\u961f\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e02\u573a\u7ade\u4e89\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u540c\u5236\u9020\u5546\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684CACC\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u5f02\u6784\u8f66\u8f86\u80fd\u5426\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u4f5c\u4ee5\u53ca\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f55\u79cd\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u65b9\u9762\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u7f16\u961f\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u5df2\u5efa\u7acb\u7684CACC\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u5b64\u7acb\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u5355\u4e2a\u6df7\u5408\u7f16\u961f\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540cCACC\u7ec4\u5408\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u7d27\u6025\u5236\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u5728\u73af\u5f62\u9053\u8def\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6df7\u5408\u7f16\u961f\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u8212\u9002\u6027\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6ACC\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9bCACC\u7ec4\u5408\u53ef\u4ee5\u7a33\u5065\u5b89\u5168\u5730\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u7ec4\u5408\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u8212\u9002\u6027\u6216\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\u3002\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u73af\u5f62\u9053\u8def\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6ACC\u6216\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u7f16\u961f\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4ed4\u7ec6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u7528\u4e8e\u5efa\u6a21\u5f02\u6784\u7f16\u961f\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a structured, interpretable format to organize such data, yet constructing product-specific KGs remains a complex and manual process. This paper introduces a fully automated, AI agent-driven framework for constructing product knowledge graphs directly from unstructured product descriptions. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), our method operates in three stages using dedicated agents: ontology creation and expansion, ontology refinement, and knowledge graph population. This agent-based approach ensures semantic coherence, scalability, and high-quality output without relying on predefined schemas or handcrafted extraction rules. We evaluate the system on a real-world dataset of air conditioner product descriptions, demonstrating strong performance in both ontology generation and KG population. The framework achieves over 97\\% property coverage and minimal redundancy, validating its effectiveness and practical applicability. Our work highlights the potential of LLMs to automate structured knowledge extraction in retail, providing a scalable path toward intelligent product data integration and utilization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u7684\u3001\u7531AI\u4ee3\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u4ea7\u54c1\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u3002", "motivation": "\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4ea7\u54c1\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed9\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5730\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u6784\u5efa\u7279\u5b9a\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u624b\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\u6765\u5b8c\u6210\uff1a\u672c\u4f53\u521b\u5efa\u4e0e\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u672c\u4f53\u7ec6\u5316\u4ee5\u53ca\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u586b\u5145\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6a21\u5f0f\u6216\u624b\u52a8\u7f16\u5199\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u786e\u4fdd\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u7a7a\u8c03\u4ea7\u54c1\u63cf\u8ff0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u672c\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u586b\u5145\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5c5e\u6027\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u8d85\u8fc797%\uff0c\u5197\u4f59\u5ea6\u6781\u4f4e\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u96f6\u552e\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4ea7\u54c1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u5229\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

This study investigates the performance of two lightweight models, YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n, which are the nano variants of the latest official YOLO series, within a unified detection and classification framework for FER. Two benchmark classification datasets, FER2013 and KDEF, are converted into object detection format and model performance is evaluated using mAP 0.5, precision, recall, and confusion matrices. Results show that YOLOv12n achieves the highest overall performance on the clean KDEF dataset with a mAP 0.5 of 95.6, and also outperforms YOLOv11n on the FER2013 dataset in terms of mAP 63.8, reflecting stronger sensitivity to varied expressions. In contrast, YOLOv11n demonstrates higher precision 65.2 on FER2013, indicating fewer false positives and better reliability in noisy, real-world conditions. On FER2013, both models show more confusion between visually similar expressions, while clearer class separation is observed on the cleaner KDEF dataset. These findings underscore the trade-off between sensitivity and precision, illustrating how lightweight YOLO models can effectively balance performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate adaptability across both controlled and real-world conditions, establishing these models as strong candidates for real-time, resource-constrained emotion-aware AI applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7YOLO\u6a21\u578b\uff08YOLOv11n\u548cYOLOv12n\uff09\u5728\u4eba\u8138\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\uff08FER\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u975e\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08FER2013\u548cKDEF\uff09\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528mAP 0.5\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c\u6df7\u6dc6\u77e9\u9635\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cYOLOv12n\u5728KDEF\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff08mAP 0.5\u4e3a95.6%\uff09\uff0c\u5728FER2013\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e5f\u4f18\u4e8eYOLOv11n\uff08mAP\u4e3a63.8%\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5bf9\u5404\u79cd\u8868\u60c5\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0cYOLOv11n\u5728FER2013\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\uff0865.2%\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u5608\u6742\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8bef\u62a5\u66f4\u5c11\uff0c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002\u5728FER2013\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u8868\u60c5\u4e4b\u95f4\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\uff0c\u800c\u5728KDEF\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5219\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u79bb\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e0e\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u660e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7YOLO\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u662f\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u611f\u77e5\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6709\u529b\u5019\u9009\u8005\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u8138\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\uff08FER\uff09\u5728\u975e\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e24\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7YOLO\u6a21\u578b\uff08YOLOv11n\u548cYOLOv12n\uff09\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684FER\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e86\u89e3\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5c06FER2013\u548cKDEF\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u683c\u5f0f\u3002\u4f7f\u7528mAP 0.5\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c\u6df7\u6dc6\u77e9\u9635\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30YOLOv11n\u548cYOLOv12n\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "YOLOv12n\u5728KDEF\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u603b\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff08mAP 0.5\u4e3a95.6%\uff09\u3002\u5728FER2013\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cYOLOv12n\u7684mAP\uff0863.8%\uff09\u4e5f\u4f18\u4e8eYOLOv11n\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u60c5\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002YOLOv11n\u5728FER2013\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\uff0865.2%\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u5608\u6742\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8bef\u62a5\u66f4\u5c11\u3002\u5728FER2013\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533a\u5206\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u8868\u60c5\u65f6\u6df7\u6dc6\u8f83\u591a\uff1b\u800c\u5728KDEF\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u79bb\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u3002\u603b\u7684\u6765\u8bf4\uff0cYOLOv12n\u5728KDEF\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u597d\uff0c\u800cYOLOv11n\u5728FER2013\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7YOLO\u6a21\u578b\uff08YOLOv11n\u548cYOLOv12n\uff09\u5728\u4eba\u8138\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5e72\u51c0\u7684KDEF\u548c\u5608\u6742\u7684FER2013\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u53d7\u63a7\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u611f\u77e5AI\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Supplementary Material: 7 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "Quantum error correction (QEC) requires non-invasive measurements for fault tolerant quantum computing. Deviations from ideal quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements can disturb the encoded information. To address this challenge, we develop a readout protocol for a $D-$dimensional system that, after a single positive outcome, switches to probing only the $D{-}1$ remaining subspace. This adaptive switching strategy minimizes measurement-induced errors by relying on negative-result measurement results that do not perturb the Hamiltonian. We apply the protocol on an 8-dimensional $^{123}{\\rm Sb}$ nuclear qudit in silicon, and achieve an increase in the readout fidelity from $(98.93\\pm0.07)\\%$ to $(99.61\\pm0.04)\\%$, while reducing threefold the overall readout time. To highlight the broader relevance of measurement-induced errors, we study a 10-dimensional $^{73}{\\rm Ge}$ nuclear spin read out through Pauli spin blockade, revealing nuclear spin flips arising from hyperfine and quadrupole interactions. These results unveil the effect of non-ideal QND readout across diverse platforms, and introduce an efficient readout protocol that can be implemented with minimal FPGA logic on existing hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bfb\u51fa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u6d4b\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6838\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u975e\u7834\u574f\u6027\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5bb9\u9519\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u4f1a\u5e72\u6270\u7f16\u7801\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bf1\u5bfc\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u8bfb\u51fa\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5207\u6362\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8bfb\u51fa\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u6b63\u5411\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u540e\uff0c\u4ec5\u63a2\u6d4b\u5269\u4f59\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bf1\u5bfc\u8bef\u5dee\u3002\u534f\u8bae\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e8\u7ef4Sb\u6838\u91cf\u5ea6\u548c10\u7ef4Ge\u6838\u81ea\u65cb\u7684\u8bfb\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728Sb\u6838\u91cf\u5ea6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bfb\u51fa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4ece(98.93\u00b10.07)%\u63d0\u9ad8\u5230(99.61\u00b10.04)%\uff0c\u8bfb\u51fa\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u77ed\u4e86\u4e09\u5206\u4e4b\u4e8c\u3002\u5728Ge\u6838\u81ea\u65cb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7531\u8d85\u7cbe\u7ec6\u548c\u56db\u6781\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6838\u81ea\u65cb\u7ffb\u8f6c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bfb\u51fa\u534f\u8bae\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bfb\u51fa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5e76\u7f29\u77ed\u8bfb\u51fa\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Yet the real world is dynamic, quasi-static interactions are insufficient to cope with the various environmental conditions. As a step toward more dynamic interaction scenario, we present a reinforcement-learning-based training pipeline that produces a unified whole-body controller for humanoid badminton, enabling coordinated lower-body footwork and upper-body striking without any motion priors or expert demonstrations. Training follows a three-stage curriculum: first footwork acquisition, then precision-guided racket swing generation, and finally task-focused refinement, yielding motions in which both legs and arms serve the hitting objective. For deployment, we incorporate an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate and predict shuttlecock trajectories for target striking. We also introduce a prediction-free variant that dispenses with EKF and explicit trajectory prediction. To validate the framework, we conduct five sets of experiment in both simulation and the real world. In simulation, two robots sustain a rally of 21 consecutive hits. Moreover, the prediction-free variant achieves successful hits with comparable performance relative to the target-known policy. In real-world tests, both the prediction and controller module exhibit high accuracy, and on-court hitting achieves an outgoing shuttle speed up to 10 m/s with a mean return landing distance of 3.5 m.

True LLM understanding, analogous to human expertise, requires making consistent, well-founded decisions across multiple instances and diverse domains, relying on relevant and domain-grounded decision factors. We introduce Structured Tabular Decision Simulations (STaDS), a suite of expert-like decision settings that evaluate LLMs as if they were professionals undertaking structured decision ``exams''. In this context, understanding is defined as the ability to identify and rely on the correct decision factors, features that determine outcomes within a domain. STaDS jointly assesses understanding through: (i) question and instruction comprehension, (ii) knowledge-based prediction, and (iii) reliance on relevant decision factors. By analyzing 9 frontier LLMs across 15 diverse decision settings, we find that (a) most models struggle to achieve consistently strong accuracy across diverse domains; (b) models can be accurate yet globally unfaithful, and there are frequent mismatches between stated rationales and factors driving predictions.

Neural controlled differential equations provide a principled framework for such tasks, yet their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of control path constructed from discrete observations. Existing methods commonly employ fixed interpolation schemes, which impose simplistic geometric assumptions that often misrepresent the underlying data manifold, particularly under high missingness. We propose FlowPath, a novel approach that learns the geometry of the control path via an invertible neural flow. Rather than merely connecting observations, FlowPath constructs a continuous and data-adaptive manifold, guided by invertibility constraints that enforce information-preserving and well-behaved transformations.

Empirical evaluations on 18 benchmark datasets and a real-world case study demonstrate that FlowPath consistently achieves statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy over baselines using fixed interpolants or non-invertible architectures.

However, the profit allocation procedures that govern VPP participants become increasingly challenging to keep incentive-compatible due to the enlarged DER market power within each VPP, compared to directly bidding into the wholesale market. In this paper, we formulate both the VPP's market participation and its internal operation and profit allocation as consistent market-clearing processes. Building on this unified view, we propose the concept of a translation-symmetric market (TSM) framework, in which market-clearing models maintain identical structural forms across all hierarchical levels. We prove that translation symmetry induces an inductive property: once incentive compatibility holds at one level, it propagates downward to the internal settlements between the VPP and its constituent DERs. TSM also preserves service prices across levels, ensuring competitive conditions and enabling transparent valuation of resource contributions. Theoretical analysis and case studies illustrate how TSM secures incentive-compatible profit allocation in aggregating DERs to provide multiple services.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u865a\u62df\u7535\u5382 (VPP) \u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8c03\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u80fd\u6e90 (DER) \u53c2\u4e0e\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u4f46 DER \u5e02\u573a\u52bf\u529b\u589e\u5927\u5bfc\u81f4\u5229\u6da6\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5bf9\u79f0\u5e02\u573a (TSM) \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06 VPP \u7684\u5e02\u573a\u53c2\u4e0e\u3001\u5185\u90e8\u8fd0\u884c\u548c\u5229\u6da6\u5206\u914d\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u6e05\u7b97\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002TSM \u6846\u67b6\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u6fc0\u52b1\u76f8\u5bb9\u6027\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u7ea7\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u670d\u52a1\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 DER \u805a\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u591a\u79cd\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u6fc0\u52b1\u76f8\u5bb9\u7684\u5229\u6da6\u5206\u914d\u3002", "motivation": "\u865a\u62df\u7535\u5382 (VPP) \u5bf9\u4e8e\u534f\u8c03\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u80fd\u6e90 (DER) \u5e76\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u591a\u79cd\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u670d\u52a1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u968f\u7740 DER \u5728 VPP \u5185\u90e8\u5e02\u573a\u52bf\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u539f\u6709\u7684\u5229\u6da6\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u6fc0\u52b1\u76f8\u5bb9\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5bf9\u79f0\u5e02\u573a (TSM) \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06 VPP \u7684\u5e02\u573a\u53c2\u4e0e\u3001\u5185\u90e8\u8fd0\u884c\u548c\u5229\u6da6\u5206\u914d\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u6e05\u7b97\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5177\u6709\u5f52\u7eb3\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u6fc0\u52b1\u76f8\u5bb9\u6027\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u7ea7\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u670d\u52a1\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cTSM \u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u805a\u5408 DER \u63d0\u4f9b\u591a\u79cd\u670d\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6fc0\u52b1\u76f8\u5bb9\u7684\u5229\u6da6\u5206\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "TSM \u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06 VPP \u7684\u5e02\u573a\u53c2\u4e0e\u3001\u5185\u90e8\u8fd0\u884c\u548c\u5229\u6da6\u5206\u914d\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u6e05\u7b97\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6765\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6fc0\u52b1\u76f8\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u4ef7\u683c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86 DER \u5e02\u573a\u52bf\u529b\u589e\u5927\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5229\u6da6\u5206\u914d\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Using high-level modelling languages such as Essence, a modeller may express their problems in terms of abstract structures. These are structures not natively supported by the solvers, and so they have to be transformed into or represented as other structures before solving. For example, nested sets are abstract structures, and they can be represented as matrices in constraint solvers. Many problems contain symmetries and one very common and highly successful technique used in constraint programming is to \"break\" symmetries, to avoid searching for symmetric solutions. This can speed up the solving process by many orders of magnitude. Most of these symmetry-breaking techniques involve placing some kind of ordering for the variables of the problem, and picking a particular member under the symmetries, usually the smallest. Unfortunately, applying this technique to abstract variables produces a very large number of complex constraints that perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate a new incomplete method of breaking the symmetries of abstract structures by better exploiting their representations. We apply the method in breaking the symmetries arising from indistinguishable objects, a commonly occurring type of symmetry, and show that our method is faster than the previous methods proposed in (Akg\u00fcn et al. 2025).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8868\u793a\u6765\u6253\u7834\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea6\u675f\u7f16\u7a0b\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6253\u7834\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u5d4c\u5957\u96c6\uff09\u65f6\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6c42\u89e3\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5904\u7406\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u793a\u6765\u6253\u7834\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u8c61\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6253\u7834\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08Akg\u00fcn et al. 2025\uff09\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6253\u7834\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5904\u7406\u6d89\u53ca\u4e0d\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, heterogeneous architecture distillation, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) to ResNet18, faces challenges due to differences in spatial feature representations.Traditional KD methods are mostly designed for homogeneous architectures and hence struggle to effectively address the disparity. Although heterogeneous KD approaches have been developed recently to solve these issues, they often incur high computational costs and complex designs, or overly rely on logit alignment, which limits their ability to leverage the complementary features. To overcome these limitations, we propose Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation (HCD),a simple yet effective framework that integrates complementary teacher and student features to align representations in shared logits.These logits are decomposed and constrained to facilitate diverse knowledge transfer to the student. Specifically, HCD processes the student's intermediate features through convolutional projector and adaptive pooling, concatenates them with teacher's feature from the penultimate layer and then maps them via the Complementary Feature Mapper (CFM) module, comprising fully connected layer,to produce shared logits.We further introduce Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation (SDD) that partitions the shared logits into n sub-logits, which are fused with teacher's logits to rectify classification.To ensure sub-logit diversity and reduce redundant knowledge transfer, we propose an Orthogonality Loss

Motivated by these challenges, this article introduces Sashimi-Bot, an autonomous multi-robotic system for advanced manipulation and cutting, specifically the preparation of sashimi. The objects that we manipulate, salmon loins, are natural in origin and vary in size and shape, they are limp and deformable with poorly characterized elastoplastic parameters, while also being slippery and hard to hold. The three robots straighten the loin; grasp and hold the knife; cut with the knife in a slicing motion while cooperatively stabilizing the loin during cutting; and pick up the thin slices from the cutting board or knife blade. Our system combines deep reinforcement learning with in-hand tool shape manipulation, in-hand tool cutting, and feedback of visual and tactile information to achieve robustness to the variabilities inherent in this task. This work represents a milestone in robotic manipulation of deformable, volumetric objects that may inspire and enable a wide range of other real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Sashimi-Bot\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u89e6\u89c9/\u89c6\u89c9\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u6293\u53d6\u3001\u56fa\u5b9a\u548c\u5207\u5272\u4e09\u6587\u9c7c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6613\u53d8\u5f62\u3001\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7ea7\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u63a7\u6613\u53d8\u5f62\u3001\u4f53\u79ef\u5e9e\u5927\u7684\u7269\u4f53\uff08\u5982\u4e09\u6587\u9c7c\uff09\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7269\u4f53\u6613\u53d8\u5f62\u3001\u6613\u635f\u3001\u5f62\u72b6\u4e0d\u4e00\u4e14\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002Sashimi-Bot\u65e8\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u624b\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u5f62\u72b6\u64cd\u63a7\u3001\u624b\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u5207\u5272\u4ee5\u53ca\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u89e6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u53cd\u9988\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u673a\u5668\u4eba1\uff1a\u62c9\u76f4\u9c7c\u8089\uff1b\u673a\u5668\u4eba2\uff1a\u6293\u63e1\u5e76\u7a33\u5b9a\u5200\u5177\uff1b\u673a\u5668\u4eba3\uff1a\u5728\u5207\u5272\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u534f\u540c\u7a33\u5b9a\u9c7c\u8089\uff0c\u5e76\u6267\u884c\u5207\u5272\u52a8\u4f5c\uff1b\u673a\u5668\u4eba4\uff1a\u4ece\u7827\u677f\u6216\u5200\u5203\u4e0a\u62fe\u53d6\u8584\u9c7c\u7247\u3002", "result": "Sashimi-Bot\u80fd\u591f\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5bf9\u4e09\u6587\u9c7c\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5757\u548c\u5207\u5272\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u7269\u4f53\u6613\u53d8\u5f62\u3001\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u6027\u7b49\u56fa\u6709\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u662f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u63a7\u6613\u53d8\u5f62\u3001\u4f53\u79ef\u5e9e\u5927\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u6280\u672f\u91cc\u7a0b\u7891\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u542f\u53d1\u548c\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

This study aims to compare the accuracy of traditional machine learning (ML) to deep transfer learning (DTL) algorithms to predict post-CI spoken language development of children with bilateral SNHL using a binary classification model of high versus low language improvers. A total of 278 implanted children enrolled from three centers. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of prediction models based upon brain neuroanatomic features using traditional ML and DTL learning. DTL prediction models using bilinear attention-based fusion strategy achieved: accuracy of 92.39% (95% CI, 90.70%-94.07%), sensitivity of 91.22% (95% CI, 89.98%-92.47%), specificity of 93.56% (95% CI, 90.91%-96.21%), and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.977 (95% CI, 0.969-0.986). DTL outperformed traditional ML models in all outcome measures. DTL was significantly improved by direct capture of discriminative and task-specific information that are advantages of representation learning enabled by this approach over ML.

In this paper we leverage new results from off-policy evaluation; it has recently been shown that well-designed behaviour policies can be used to collect off-policy data for provably lower variance return estimates. This result is surprising as it means collecting data on-policy is not variance optimal. We extend this key insight to the online reinforcement learning setting, where both policy evaluation and improvement are interleaved to learn optimal policies. Off-policy RL has been well studied (e.g., IMPALA), with correct and truncated importance weighted samples for de-biasing and managing variance appropriately. Generally these approaches are concerned with reconciling data collected from multiple workers in parallel, while the policy is updated asynchronously, mismatch between the workers and policy is corrected in a mathematically sound way. Here we consider only one worker - the behaviour policy, which is used to collect data for policy improvement, with provably lower variance return estimates. In our experiments we extend two policy-gradient methods with this regime, demonstrating better sample efficiency and performance over a diverse set of environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u6765\u81ea\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u90a3\u4e9b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6536\u76ca\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fdb\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff09\u5728\u6536\u76ca\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u4ea4\u7ec7\u8fdb\u884c\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u66f4\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u6536\u76ca\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u6536\u76ca\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Conformal Prediction for Interactive Multi-Agent Systems", "comment": null, "summary": "Uncertainty-aware prediction is essential for safe motion planning, especially when using learned models to forecast the behavior of surrounding agents. Conformal prediction is a statistical tool often used to produce uncertainty-aware prediction regions for machine learning models. Most existing frameworks utilizing conformal prediction-based uncertainty predictions assume that the surrounding agents are non-interactive. This is because in closed-loop, as uncertainty-aware agents change their behavior to account for prediction uncertainty, the surrounding agents respond to this change, leading to a distribution shift which we call endogenous distribution shift. To address this challenge, we introduce an iterative conformal prediction framework that systematically adapts the uncertainty-aware ego-agent controller to the endogenous distribution shift. The proposed method provides probabilistic safety guarantees while adapting to the evolving behavior of reactive, non-ego agents. We establish a model for the endogenous distribution shift and provide the conditions for the iterative conformal prediction pipeline to converge under such a distribution shift. We validate our framework in simulation for 2- and 3- agent interaction scenarios, demonstrating collision avoidance without resulting in overly conservative behavior and an overall improvement in success rates of up to 9.6% compared to other conformal prediction-based baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8fed\u4ee3\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5185\u751f\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6982\u7387\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u907f\u78b0\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u5468\u56f4\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u884c\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5185\u751f\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8fed\u4ee3\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u8c03\u6574\u8003\u8651\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u5185\u751f\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5185\u751f\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u8fed\u4ee3\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u6d41\u7a0b\u5728\u6f02\u79fb\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6536\u655b\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u76842\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u907f\u78b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4fdd\u5b88\uff0c\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e869.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5185\u751f\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5305\u542b\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u7387\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

However, the critical aspect of role allocation strategies remains underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that allocating roles with differing viewpoints to specific positions significantly impacts MAD's performance in reasoning tasks. Specifically, we find a novel role allocation strategy, \"Truth Last\", which can improve MAD performance by up to 22% in reasoning tasks. To address the issue of unknown truth in practical applications, we propose the Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC) strategy, which systematically simulates and optimizes its core mechanisms.

Many existing works attempt to address this issue by leveraging model representations (e.g., mean feature vectors) to correct local training; however, they often face two key limitations: 1) Incomplete Contextual Representation Learning: Current approaches primarily focus on final-layer features, overlooking critical multi-level cues and thus diluting essential context for accurate segmentation. 2) Layerwise Style Bias Accumulation: Although utilizing representations can partially align global features, these methods neglect domain-specific biases within intermediate layers, allowing style discrepancies to build up and reduce model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose FedBCS to bridge feature representation gaps via domain-invariant contextual prototypes alignment. Specifically, we introduce a frequency-domain adaptive style recalibration into prototype construction that not only decouples content-style representations but also learns optimal style parameters, enabling more robust domain-invariant prototypes. Furthermore, we design a context-aware dual-level prototype alignment method that extracts domain-invariant prototypes from different layers of both encoder and decoder and fuses them with contextual information for finer-grained representation alignment. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits remarkable performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u9762\u4e34\u7279\u5f81\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u56e0\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u6d45\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u7d2f\u79ef\u5c42\u7ea7\u98ce\u683c\u504f\u5dee\u800c\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFedBCS\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u539f\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u533b\u7597\u673a\u6784\u95f4\u56e0\u4e0d\u540c\u626b\u63cf\u4eea\u6216\u534f\u8bae\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5c42\u7ea7\u98ce\u683c\u504f\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFedBCS\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9891\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u98ce\u683c\u91cd\u6821\u51c6\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u5185\u5bb9-\u98ce\u683c\u8868\u5f81\u5e76\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u98ce\u683c\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u539f\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u539f\u578b\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "FedBCS\u901a\u8fc7\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u539f\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Previous studies tend to rely on the model itself to implicitly learn semantic modeling during training, and resort to inefficient and costly manual annotations for these two challenges. To mitigate these limitations, we propose enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) speech projector, where each expert specializes in the semantic subspace of a specific language, enabling fine-grained modeling of speech features. Additionally, we introduce a multi-stage training paradigm that utilizes readily available monolingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) and monolingual ST data, facilitating speech-text alignment and improving translation capabilities. During training, we leverage a combination of language-specific loss and intra-group load balancing loss to guide the MoE speech projector in efficiently allocating tokens to the appropriate experts, across expert groups and within each group, respectively. To bridge the data gap across different training stages and improve adaptation to the CS scenario, we further employ a transition loss, enabling smooth transitions of data between stages, to effectively address the scarcity of high-quality CS speech translation data.

To bridge this gap, we introduce SandboxVLM, a simple yet effective framework that leverages abstract bounding boxes to encode geometric structure and physical kinematics for VLM. Specifically, we design a 3D Sandbox reconstruction and perception pipeline comprising four stages: generating multi-view priors with abstract control, proxy elevation, multi-view voting and clustering, and 3D-aware reasoning. Evaluated in zero-shot settings across multiple benchmarks and VLM backbones, our approach consistently improves spatial intelligence, achieving an 8.3\\% gain on SAT Real compared with baseline methods for instance. These results demonstrate that equipping VLMs with a 3D abstraction substantially enhances their 3D reasoning ability without additional training, suggesting new possibilities for general-purpose embodied intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "SandboxVLM\u5229\u7528\u62bd\u8c61\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u6765\u5f25\u5408\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (VLM) \u57283D\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc73D\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (VLM) \u5728\u5904\u74063D\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u7269\u7406\u7406\u89e3\uff09\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u8fd9\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u7b49\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u56f0\u96be\u6e90\u4e8e3D\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e2D\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ece2D\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d63D\u4fe1\u606f\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "SandboxVLM\u6846\u67b6\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a3D\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a1. \u4f7f\u7528\u62bd\u8c61\u63a7\u5236\u751f\u6210\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b2. \u4ee3\u7406\u9ad8\u7a0b\uff1b3. \u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6295\u7968\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\uff1b4. 3D\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u62bd\u8c61\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u6765\u7f16\u7801\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7269\u7406\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u548cVLM\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cSandboxVLM\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728SAT Real\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e868.3%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3aVLM\u914d\u59073D\u62bd\u8c61\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u51763D\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent advancements in technology led to a number of demonstrations which test non-classicality via specific computational tasks. Limitations of these experiments include dependence on complexity theory assumptions, susceptibility to hardware noise and inefficient verification, raising questions about their scalability. We propose to test non-classicality using a game based on complement sampling, an efficiently verifiable problem that achieves the largest possible separation between quantum and classical computation when both input and output represent samples from probability distributions. When restricting the input to instances inspired by the Bernstein-Vazirani problem, our game admits an exponentially large violation of classicality without relying on computational hardness assumptions. We execute the game on Quantinuum System Model H2 trapped-ion quantum computers, with experiments consisting of thousands of different circuits on up to 55 qubits. The observed scores can be explained by a systematic adoption of a quantum strategy, further corroborating the quantum nature of the hardware in an efficient and scalable way.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e92\u8865\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u6765\u68c0\u9a8c\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u6027\uff0c\u8be5\u6e38\u620f\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e14\u80fd\u6700\u5927\u5316\u533a\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u5047\u8bbe\u3001\u6613\u53d7\u786c\u4ef6\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\u4e14\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e92\u8865\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408 Bernstein-Vazirani \u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u5728 Quantinuum System Model H2 \u79bb\u5b50\u9631\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\u8be5\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u8fbe 55 \u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u548c\u6570\u5343\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7535\u8def\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u5206\u6570\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u91c7\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u8ba1\u7b97\u786c\u5ea6\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u5de8\u5927\u8fdd\u53cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e92\u8865\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u68c0\u9a8c\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6709\u529b\u5730\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6027\u8d28\u3002"}}

However, conventional approaches are computationally expensive and lack a high-quality labeled dataset for multi-joint applications. To address these challenges, we propose a physics-informed deep learning framework that estimates muscle activations and forces directly from kinematics. The framework employs a novel Multi-Joint Cross-Attention (MJCA) module with Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) layers to capture inter-joint coordination, enabling each joint to adaptively integrate motion information from others. By embedding multi-joint dynamics, inter-joint coupling, and external force interactions into the loss function, our Physics-Informed MJCA-BiGRU (PI-MJCA-BiGRU) delivers physiologically consistent predictions without labeled data while enabling time-efficient inference. Experimental validation on two datasets demonstrates that PI-MJCA-BiGRU achieves performance comparable to conventional supervised methods without requiring ground-truth labels, while the MJCA module significantly enhances inter-joint coordination modeling compared to other baseline architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u5173\u8282\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08MJCA\uff09\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u95e8\u63a7\u5faa\u73af\u5355\u5143\uff08BiGRU\uff09\u6765\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u4f30\u8ba1\u808c\u8089\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u8bbe\u5907\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u5173\u8282\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u808c\u8089\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u529b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u8bbe\u5907\u63a7\u5236\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPI-MJCA-BiGRU\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u591a\u5173\u8282\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08MJCA\uff09\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u95e8\u63a7\u5faa\u73af\u5355\u5143\uff08BiGRU\uff09\u5c42\uff0c\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u4f30\u8ba1\u808c\u8089\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u529b\u3002MJCA\u6a21\u5757\u65e8\u5728\u6355\u6349\u5173\u8282\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u800c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u5219\u88ab\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u751f\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0cPI-MJCA-BiGRU\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u5730\u9762\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14MJCA\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u5173\u8282\u534f\u8c03\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u7684PI-MJCA-BiGRU\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u808c\u8089\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u529b\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u5173\u8282\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u8bbe\u5907\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

GVF integrates explicit factual signals via three core mechanisms: Factual Anchor Data Augmentation, enriching training data with structured factual anchors and counter-factual prompts; Fact-Aware Instruction Tuning, embedding these cues into explicit instructions; and a Factual Consistency Loss function, specifically penalizing factual inaccuracies. Evaluated on LLaVA-1.5-13B, GVF Finetuning significantly outperforms standard fine-tuning on the VHTest benchmark for both Open-Ended Question (OEQ) and Yes/No Question (YNQ) formats.

Beyond its fundamental interest, photon and multi-photon blockade are actively studied as mechanisms for generating technologically-relevant quantum states of light. Although photon blockade typically requires achieving strong light-matter coupling, increasing the number of atoms fails to enhance antibunching. Here, we analyze the optical transmission properties of a quantum resonator that embeds a two-photon-coupled ensemble of emitters, combining an approximate analytical approach with full quantum numerical simulations. We show that when light and matter are coupled via a two-photon interaction, both single- and multi-photon blockade can benefit from a collective enhancement. We propose different driving schemes in which the second or third-order correlation functions are strongly suppressed with increasing atom number. Differently from established methods, this collective enhancement of non-classical properties occurs with unitary transmission and is ultimately constrained only by decoherence. This demonstrates that collective two-photon couplings are a powerful mechanism for realizing photon blockade even in platforms where individual strong coupling is not achievable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8c10\u632f\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u5149\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u8026\u5408\u7684\u96c6\u675f\u53d1\u5c04\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u548c\u591a\u5149\u5b50\u963b\u585e\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u5149\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u8c10\u632f\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u5149\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u8026\u5408\u7684\u96c6\u675f\u53d1\u5c04\u5668\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u548c\u591a\u5149\u5b50\u963b\u585e\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u6280\u672f\u4e0a\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5149\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd1\u4f3c\u89e3\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5168\u91cf\u5b50\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5d4c\u5165\u4e24\u5149\u5b50\u8026\u5408\u53d1\u5c04\u5668\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8c10\u632f\u5668\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u4f20\u8f93\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u5149\u4e0e\u7269\u8d28\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u5149\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u8026\u5408\u65f6\uff0c\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u548c\u591a\u5149\u5b50\u963b\u585e\u6548\u5e94\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u53d7\u76ca\u4e8e\u96c6\u4f53\u589e\u5f3a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u968f\u7740\u539f\u5b50\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5f3a\u70c8\u6291\u5236\u4e8c\u9636\u6216\u4e09\u9636\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u96c6\u4f53\u4e24\u5149\u5b50\u8026\u5408\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5149\u5b50\u963b\u585e\u7684\u6709\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2a\u4f53\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u4e5f\u662f\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u589e\u5f3a\u4ec5\u53d7\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}

To cope, code selection algorithms select the best program from multiple programs generated by an LLM. However, existing algorithms can fail to identify the correct program, either because they can misidentify nonequivalent programs or because they rely on an LLM and assume it always correctly determines the output for every input. We present ExPairT-LLM, an exact learning algorithm for code selection that selects a program by posing to an LLM oracle two new types of queries: pairwise membership and pairwise equivalence.

ARCTraj addresses this gap by recording temporally ordered, object-level actions that capture how humans iteratively transform inputs into outputs, revealing intermediate reasoning steps that conventional datasets overlook. Collected via the O2ARC web interface, it contains around 10,000 trajectories annotated with task identifiers, timestamps, and success labels across 400 training tasks from the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark. It further defines a unified reasoning pipeline encompassing data collection, action abstraction, Markov decision process (MDP) formulation, and downstream learning, enabling integration with reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and sequence modeling methods such as PPO, World Models, GFlowNets, Diffusion agents, and Decision Transformers.

Applying a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to this task enables spatio-temporal analysis of facial motion and provides interpretable descriptions. However, there are still two core challenges: (1) The entanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion cues prevents the model from focusing on subtle motion; (2) Textual labels in existing MER datasets do not fully correspond to underlying facial muscle movements, creating a semantic gap between text supervision and physical motion. To address these issues, we propose DEFT-LLM, which achieves motion semantic alignment by multi-expert disentanglement. We first introduce Uni-MER, a motion-driven instruction dataset designed to align text with local facial motion. Its construction leverages dual constraints from optical flow and Action Unit (AU) labels to ensure spatio-temporal consistency and reasonable correspondence to the movements. We then design an architecture with three experts to decouple facial dynamics into independent and interpretable representations (structure, dynamic textures, and motion-semantics). By integrating the instruction-aligned knowledge from Uni-MER into DEFT-LLM, our method injects effective physical priors for micro expressions while also leveraging the cross modal reasoning ability of large language models, thus enabling precise capture of subtle emotional cues.

To address this gap, we present SimTac, a physics-based simulation framework for the design and validation of biomorphic tactile sensors. SimTac consists of particle-based deformation modeling, light-field rendering for photorealistic tactile image generation, and a neural network for predicting mechanical responses, enabling accurate and efficient simulation across a wide range of geometries and materials. We demonstrate the versatility of SimTac by designing and validating physical sensor prototypes inspired by biological tactile structures and further demonstrate its effectiveness across multiple Sim2Real tactile tasks, including object classification, slip detection, and contact safety assessment. Our framework bridges the gap between bio-inspired design and practical realisation, expanding the design space of tactile sensors and paving the way for tactile sensing systems that integrate morphology and sensing to enable robust interaction in unstructured environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "SimTac\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4eff\u751f\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u7c92\u5b50\u53d8\u5f62\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u5149\u573a\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u5404\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u6750\u6599\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5df2\u6210\u529f\u7528\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53d7\u751f\u7269\u7ed3\u6784\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u6253\u6ed1\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176Sim2Real\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u96c6\u6210\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u4ea4\u4e92\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u89e6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u5176\u5f62\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u624b\u6307\u3001\u732b\u722a\u3001\u8c61\u9f3b\uff09\u7d27\u5bc6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e30\u5bcc\u591a\u6837\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5e73\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u4eff\u751f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u5f85\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSimTac\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4eff\u751f\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1. \u7c92\u5b50\u53d8\u5f62\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u6750\u6599\u5f62\u53d8\uff1b2. \u5149\u573a\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u7684\u89e6\u89c9\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b3. \u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u529b\u5b66\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u6750\u6599\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7SimTac\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u53d7\u751f\u7269\u89e6\u89c9\u7ed3\u6784\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u539f\u578b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u6253\u6ed1\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b49\u591a\u4e2aSim2Real\u89e6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SimTac\u6846\u67b6\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u4eff\u751f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u62d3\u5bbd\u4e86\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u96c6\u6210\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u7684\u89e6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002"}}

Zeroth-order methods have promise in mitigating the overhead, as they leverage function evaluations to approximate the gradients, hence significantly easier to privatize. While recent works have explored zeroth-order approaches in both private and non-private settings, they still suffer from relatively low utilities compared with DP-SGD, and have only been evaluated in limited application domains. In this work, we propose to leverage public information to guide and improve gradient approximation of private zeroth-order algorithms. We explore a suite of public-data-assisted zeroth-order optimizers (PAZO) with minimal overhead. We provide theoretical analyses of the PAZO framework under an assumption of the similarity between public and private data.

However, existing methods face challenges in capturing global dependencies in video content and accommodating multimodal user customization. Moreover, temporal proximity between video frames does not always correspond to semantic proximity. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Language-guided Graph Representation Learning Network (LGRLN) for video summarization. Specifically, we introduce a video graph generator that converts video frames into a structured graph to preserve temporal order and contextual dependencies. By constructing forward, backward and undirected graphs, the video graph generator effectively preserves the sequentiality and contextual relationships of video content. We designed an intra-graph relational reasoning module with a dual-threshold graph convolution mechanism, which distinguishes semantically relevant frames from irrelevant ones between nodes. Additionally, our proposed language-guided cross-modal embedding module generates video summaries with specific textual descriptions. We model the summary generation output as a mixture of Bernoulli distribution and solve it with the EM algorithm. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks.

Even though the charged particle is not allowed to interact with the magnetic field, it accumulates a phase shift that affects the interference pattern produced. Not surprisingly, this apparent nonlocality is puzzling and counter intuitive. In this work, we provide an explanation that explains the physics underlying this apparent nonlocality. We find that the role of the confined magnetic field is to impart a puncture in the configuration space, $\\mathbb{R}^2$, of the charge.

In these non-Markovian settings, key decision cues are often hidden in object-specific histories rather than the current scene. Without persistent memory of prior interactions (what has been interacted with, where it has been, or how it has changed) visuomotor policies may fail, repeat past actions, or overlook completed ones. To surface this challenge, we introduce LIBERO-Mem, a non-Markovian task suite for stress-testing robotic manipulation under object-level partial observability. It combines short- and long-horizon object tracking with temporally sequenced subgoals, requiring reasoning beyond the current frame. However, vision-language-action (VLA) models often struggle in such settings, with token scaling quickly becoming intractable even for tasks spanning just a few hundred frames. We propose Embodied-SlotSSM, a slot-centric VLA framework built for temporal scalability. It maintains spatio-temporally consistent slot identities and leverages them through two mechanisms: (1) slot-state-space modeling for reconstructing short-term history, and (2) a relational encoder to align the input tokens with action decoding. Together, these components enable temporally grounded, context-aware action prediction.

We design and evaluate multiple variations of a learning agent architecture that vary in how they capture and retrieve past experiences.

They are widely used in computational materials simulations. However, the development and application of MLFFs for lithium-ion battery cathode materials remain relatively limited. This is primarily due to the complex electronic structure characteristics of cathode materials and the resulting scarcity of high-quality computational datasets available for force field training. In this work, we develop a multi-fidelity machine learning force field framework to enhance the data efficiency of computational results, which can simultaneously utilize both low-fidelity non-magnetic and high-fidelity magnetic computational datasets of cathode materials for training. Tests conducted on the lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) cathode material system demonstrate the effectiveness of this multi-fidelity approach. This work helps to achieve high-accuracy MLFF training for cathode materials at a lower training dataset cost, and offers new perspectives for applying MLFFs to computational simulations of cathode materials.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u529b\u573a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u53ef\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u6b63\u6781\u6750\u6599\u7684\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u975e\u78c1\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u78c1\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9502\u9530\u94c1\u78f7\u9178\uff08LMFP\uff09\u6b63\u6781\u6750\u6599\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9502\u79bb\u5b50\u7535\u6c60\u6b63\u6781\u6750\u6599\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u529b\u573a\uff08MLFF\uff09\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6b63\u6781\u6750\u6599\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u5bfc\u81f4\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u529b\u573a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u975e\u78c1\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u78c1\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9502\u9530\u94c1\u78f7\u9178\uff08LMFP\uff09\u6b63\u6781\u6750\u6599\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4ee5\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6b63\u6781\u6750\u6599\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6 MLFF \u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5c06 MLFF \u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6b63\u6781\u6750\u6599\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

We classify the equilibria of the ``single-head'' self-attention system into four classes: consensus, bipartite consensus, clustering and polygonal equilibria.

Despite their unprecedented ability to synthesize information, a critical gap persists in evaluation: existing benchmarks primarily assess discriminative understanding or unconstrained image generation separately, failing to measure the integrated cognitive process of generative reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose that geometric construction provides an ideal testbed as it inherently demands a fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation. We introduce GGBench, a benchmark designed specifically to evaluate geometric generative reasoning. It provides a comprehensive framework for systematically diagnosing a model's ability to not only understand and reason but to actively construct a solution, thereby setting a more rigorous standard for the next generation of intelligent systems.

A key challenge in DFER is the many-to-one labeling problem, where a video composed of numerous frames is assigned a single emotion label. A common strategy to mitigate this issue is to formulate DFER as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. However, MIL-based approaches inherently suffer from the visual diversity of emotional expressions and the complexity of temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose TG-DFER, a text-guided weakly supervised framework that enhances MIL-based DFER by incorporating semantic guidance and coherent temporal modeling. We incorporate a vision-language pre-trained (VLP) model is integrated to provide semantic guidance through fine-grained textual descriptions of emotional context. Furthermore, we introduce visual prompts, which align enriched textual emotion labels with visual instance features, enabling fine-grained reasoning and frame-level relevance estimation. In addition, a multi-grained temporal network is designed to jointly capture short-term facial dynamics and long-range emotional flow, ensuring coherent affective understanding across time.

However, the selection of in-context demonstrations plays a crucial role and can significantly affect LLMs' performance. Most existing demonstration selection methods primarily focus on semantic similarity between test inputs and demonstrations, often overlooking the importance of label distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage demonstration selection method, TopK + Label Distribution Divergence (L2D), which leverages a fine-tuned BERT-like small language model (SLM) to generate label distributions and calculate their divergence for both test inputs and candidate demonstrations. This enables the selection of demonstrations that are not only semantically similar but also aligned in label distribution with the test input. Extensive experiments across seven text classification benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms previous demonstration selection strategies.

However, existing approaches typically rely on domain-specific knowledge to construct these graphs, limiting their applicability to new tasks. Other graph-based approaches create graphs dynamically during exploration but struggle to fully utilize them, because they have problems passing the information in the graphs to newly visited states. Additionally, current GCHRL methods face challenges such as sample inefficiency and poor subgoal representation. This paper proposes a solution to these issues by developing a graph encoder-decoder to evaluate unseen states. Our proposed method, Graph-Guided sub-Goal representation Generation RL (G4RL), can be incorporated into any existing GCHRL method when operating in environments with primarily symmetric and reversible transitions to enhance performance across this class of problems. We show that the graph encoder-decoder can be effectively implemented using a network trained on the state graph generated during exploration.

Standard solutions, such as auxiliary load-balancing losses, can reduce load disparities but often weaken expert specialization and hurt downstream performance. To address these issues, we propose ERMoE, a sparse MoE transformer that reparameterizes each expert in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis and replaces learned gating logits with an \"Eigenbasis Score\", defined as the cosine similarity between input features and an expert's basis. This content-aware routing ties token assignments directly to experts' representation spaces, stabilizing utilization and promoting interpretable specialization without sacrificing sparsity. Crucially, ERMoE removes the need for explicit balancing losses and avoids the interfering gradients they introduce. We show that ERMoE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification and cross-modal image-text retrieval benchmarks (e.g., COCO, Flickr30K), while naturally producing flatter expert load distributions. Moreover, a 3D MRI variant (ERMoE-ba) improves brain age prediction accuracy by more than 7\\% and yields anatomically interpretable expert specializations. ERMoE thus introduces a new architectural principle for sparse expert models that directly addresses routing instabilities and enables improved performance with scalable, interpretable specialization.", "AI": {"tldr": "ERMoE\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e13\u5bb6\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u7279\u5f81\u57fa\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u201c\u7279\u5f81\u57fa\u5f97\u5206\u201d\uff08\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u57fa\u7684\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff09\u66ff\u6362\u95e8\u63a7logit\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e3\u51b3Mixture-of-Experts\uff08MoE\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8def\u7531\u4e0d\u7a33\u548c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0d\u5747\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u7684MoE\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u8def\u7531\u4e0d\u7a33\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u635f\u5931\uff09\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "ERMoE\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u91cd\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u7279\u5f81\u57fa\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u57fa\u7684\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8def\u7531\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8def\u7531\u3002", "result": "ERMoE\u5728ImageNet\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u56fe\u6587\u68c0\u7d22\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5e73\u5766\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5206\u5e03\u3002ERMoE-ba\u5728\u8111\u9f84\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e867%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "ERMoE\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8def\u7531\u4e0d\u7a33\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Establishing connections between the RH and physical phenomena could offer new perspectives on its physical origin and verification. Here, we establish a direct correspondence between the nontrivial zeros of the zeta function and dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in two realizable quantum systems, characterized by the averaged accumulated phase factor and the Loschmidt amplitude, respectively. This precise correspondence reveals that the RH can be viewed as the emergence of DQPTs at a specific temperature. We experimentally demonstrate this correspondence on a five-qubit spin-based system and further propose an universal quantum simulation framework for efficiently realizing both systems with polynomial resources, offering a quantum advantage for numerical verification of the RH. These findings uncover an intrinsic link between nonequilibrium critical dynamics and the RH, positioning quantum computing as a powerful platform for exploring one of mathematics' most enduring conjectures and beyond.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9ece\u66fc\u731c\u60f3\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\uff08DQPTs\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9ece\u66fc\u731c\u60f3\u53ef\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3aDQPTs\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e94\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u81ea\u65cb\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u4ee5\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u9762\u83b7\u5f97\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u503c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9ece\u66fc\u731c\u60f3\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u5efa\u7acb\u9ece\u66fc\u731c\u60f3\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u9ece\u66fc\u731c\u60f3\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5176\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u9ece\u66fczeta\u51fd\u6570\u96f6\u70b9\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u7d2f\u79ef\u76f8\u4f4d\u56e0\u5b50\u548cLoschmidt\u5e45\u5ea6\u6765\u5efa\u7acb\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u9ece\u66fc\u731c\u60f3\u89c6\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\uff08DQPTs\uff09\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u81ea\u65cb\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u9ece\u66fc\u731c\u60f3\u4e0eDQPTs\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u8d44\u6e90\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u9762\u83b7\u5f97\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u4e34\u754c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u9ece\u66fc\u731c\u60f3\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u5728\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e73\u53f0\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u9ece\u66fc\u731c\u60f3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6570\u5b66\u96be\u9898\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose TLV-CoRe, a CLIP-based Tactile-Language-Vision Collaborative Representation learning method.

Additionally, a Unified Bridging Adapter is introduced to enhance tri-modal interaction within the shared representation space. To fairly evaluate the effectiveness of tactile models, we further propose the RSS evaluation framework, focusing on Robustness, Synergy, and Stability across different methods.

As MoE models only activate part of the experts, related work has proposed expert prediction and caching methods to prefetch the experts for faster inference. However, existing approaches utilize the activations from the previous layer for prediction, incurring low accuracy and leave the first layer unoptimized. Applying complex layers or even training standalone networks for better prediction introduces high computation overhead. In this paper, we propose pre-attention expert prediction to achieve accurate and lightweight expert prefetching. The key insight is that some functions in LLMs are ranking-preserving, indicating that matching the ranking of selected experts using simple linear functions is possible. Therefore, we utilize the activations before the attention block in the same layer with 2 linear functions and ranking-aware loss to achieve accurate prediction, which also supports prefetching in the first layer. Our lightweight, pre-attention expert routers achieve 93.03% accuracy on DeepSeek V2 Lite, 94.69% on Qwen3-30B, and 97.62% on Phi-mini-MoE, showing about 15% improvement on absolute accuracy over the state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u9884\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u79e9\u4fdd\u62a4\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e13\u5bb6\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2aMoE\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684MoE\u6a21\u578b\u4e13\u5bb6\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u524d\u4e00\u5c42\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f4e\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u7b2c\u4e00\u5c42\uff1b\u800c\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53c8\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9884\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e13\u5bb6\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u540c\u4e00\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ebf\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u79e9\u611f\u77e5\u635f\u5931\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7b2c\u4e00\u5c42\u9884\u53d6\u3002", "result": "\u5728DeepSeek V2 Lite\u3001Qwen3-30B\u548cPhi-mini-MoE\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523093.03%\u300194.69%\u548c97.62%\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea615%\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9884\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e13\u5bb6\u8def\u7531\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u4e13\u5bb6\u9884\u53d6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

During inference, STaR performs trajectory-level uncertainty quantification by integrating token-level confidence and answer consistency, enabling selection of more credible reasoning paths.

While recent advances in vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong generalization across domains, extending them to continual settings remains challenging. In particular, learning task-specific soft prompts for newly introduced classes often leads to severe classifier bias, as the text prototypes overfit to recent categories when prior data are unavailable. In this paper, we propose DMC, a simple yet effective two-stage framework for CLIP-based CIL that decouples the adaptation of the vision encoder and the optimization of textual soft prompts. Each stage is trained with the other frozen, allowing one modality to act as a stable semantic anchor for the other to preserve cross-modal alignment. Furthermore, current CLIP-based CIL approaches typically store class-wise Gaussian statistics for generative replay, yet they overlook the distributional drift that arises when the vision encoder is updated over time. To address this issue, we introduce DMC-OT, an enhanced version of DMC that incorporates an optimal-transport guided calibration strategy to align memory statistics across evolving encoders, along with a task-specific prompting design that enhances inter-task separability. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Imagenet-R, CUB-200, and UCF-101 demonstrate that both DMC and DMC-OT achieve state-of-the-art performance, with DMC-OT further improving accuracy by an average of 1.80%.", "AI": {"tldr": "DMC\u548cDMC-OT\u662f\u7528\u4e8eCLIP\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u6587\u672c\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f15\u5165\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7c7b\u522b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CIL\uff09\u65e8\u5728\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u9057\u5fd8\u65e7\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684CLIP\u57fa\u7840CIL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u539f\u578b\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5148\u524d\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f1a\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62df\u5408\u8fd1\u671f\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "method": "DMC\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u6587\u672c\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u5f00\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u51bb\u7ed3\u53e6\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002DMC-OT\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u7684\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "DMC\u548cDMC-OT\u5728CIFAR-100\u3001Imagenet-R\u3001CUB-200\u548cUCF-101\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0cDMC-OT\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e861.80%\u3002", "conclusion": "DMC\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86CLIP\u57fa\u7840CIL\u4e2d\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002DMC-OT\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Workshop website: https://sites.google.com/rice.edu/parallelized-planning-control/", "summary": "Coverage motion planning is essential to a wide range of robotic tasks. Unlike conventional motion planning problems, which reason over temporal sequences of states, coverage motion planning requires reasoning over the spatial distribution of entire trajectories, making standard motion planning methods limited in computational efficiency and less amenable to modern parallelization frameworks. In this work, we formulate the coverage motion planning problem as a statistical inference problem from the perspective of flow matching, a generative modeling technique that has gained significant attention in recent years. The proposed formulation unifies commonly used statistical discrepancy measures, such as Kullback-Leibler divergence and Sinkhorn divergence, with a standard linear quadratic regulator problem. More importantly, it decouples the generation of trajectory gradients for coverage from the synthesis of control under nonlinear system dynamics, enabling significant acceleration through parallelization on modern computational architectures, particularly Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). This paper focuses on the advantages of this formulation in terms of scalability through parallelization, highlighting its computational benefits compared to conventional methods based on waypoint tracking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u8986\u76d6\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u89c6\u4e3a\u6d41\u91cf\u5339\u914d\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u8f68\u8ff9\u68af\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e76\u884c\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8986\u76d6\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u4ece\u6d41\u91cf\u5339\u914d\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u5dee\u5f02\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08\u5982KL\u6563\u5ea6\u548cSinkhorn\u6563\u5ea6\uff09\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u4e8c\u6b21\u8c03\u8282\u5668\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u8f68\u8ff9\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0b\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5408\u6210\u5206\u79bb\u5f00\u6765\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u822a\u70b9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u5316\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728GPU\u4e0a\uff09\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u91cf\u5339\u914d\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8986\u76d6\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u52bf\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8986\u76d6\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

These emissions are largely contributed to by the production, use and disposal of consumer products. Thus, it is important to build tools to estimate the environmental impact of consumer goods, an essential part of which is conducting Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs). LCAs specify and account for the appropriate processes involved with the production, use, and disposal of the products. We present SpiderGen, an LLM-based workflow which integrates the taxonomy and methodology of traditional LCA with the reasoning capabilities and world knowledge of LLMs to generate the procedural information used for LCA. We additionally evaluate the output of SpiderGen using real-world LCA documents as ground-truth. We find that SpiderGen provides accurate LCA process information that is either fully correct or has minor errors, achieving an F1-Score of 62% across 10 sample data points. We observe that the remaining missed processes and hallucinated errors occur primarily due to differences in detail between LCA documents, as well as differences in the \"scope\" of which auxiliary processes must also be included. We also demonstrate that SpiderGen performs better than several baselines techniques, such as chain-of-thought prompting and one-shot prompting. Finally, we highlight SpiderGen's potential to reduce the human effort and costs for estimating carbon impact, as it is able to produce LCA process information for less than \\$1 USD in under 10 minutes as compared to the status quo LCA, which can cost over \\$25000 USD and take up to 21-person days.", "AI": {"tldr": "SpiderGen\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u4ea7\u54c1\u751f\u6210\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08LCA\uff09\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u6d88\u8d39\u54c1\u751f\u4ea7\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u5904\u7f6e\u5bf9\u6e29\u5ba4\u6c14\u4f53\u6392\u653e\u548c\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u6709\u91cd\u5927\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u4f30\u7b97\u6d88\u8d39\u54c1\u7684\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08LCA\uff09\u662f\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "method": "SpiderGen\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u4f20\u7edfLCA\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u4e0eLLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u751f\u6210LCA\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "SpiderGen\u572810\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8662%\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u751f\u6210\u7684LCA\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4fe1\u606f\u662f\u51c6\u786e\u7684\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u53ea\u6709\u5fae\u5c0f\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u4e0e\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u8003\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5355\u6b21\u63d0\u793a\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cSpiderGen\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002SpiderGen\u751f\u6210LCA\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4fe1\u606f\u6210\u672c\u4e0d\u52301\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u8017\u65f6\u4e0d\u523010\u5206\u949f\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684LCA\u53ef\u80fd\u8017\u8d44\u8d85\u8fc725000\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u8017\u65f6\u591a\u8fbe21\u4eba\u5929\u3002", "conclusion": "SpiderGen\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u4f4e\u4eba\u529b\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u4f30\u7b97\u78b3\u5f71\u54cd\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u6210\u4e3aLCA\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

To address this gap, we introduce UAVBench, an open benchmark dataset comprising 50,000 validated UAV flight scenarios generated through taxonomy-guided LLM prompting and multi-stage safety validation. Each scenario is encoded in a structured JSON schema that includes mission objectives, vehicle configuration, environmental conditions, and quantitative risk labels, providing a unified representation of UAV operations across diverse domains. Building on this foundation, we present UAVBench_MCQ, a reasoning-oriented extension containing 50,000 multiple-choice questions spanning ten cognitive and ethical reasoning styles, ranging from aerodynamics and navigation to multi-agent coordination and integrated reasoning. This framework enables interpretable and machine-checkable assessment of UAV-specific cognition under realistic operational contexts.

We trace this instability to the common extension of Rotary Position Embeddings to video through multimodal RoPE. The induced inverse Fourier time kernel exhibits frame-scale ripples that multiply adjacent frames by different factors, which perturbs attention that should otherwise be governed by the raw query key inner product. We present Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS), a simple, training-free mechanism that applies small opposed phase offsets across heads and then aggregates their outputs. PAS preserves the per-head spectrum magnitude, while the aggregation effectively smooths the temporal kernel and reduces phase sensitivity without changing the positional encoding structure. Our analysis shows that the RoPE rotated logit can be approximated as a content dot product scaled by a time kernel; smoothing this kernel yields Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts; multi phase averaging attenuates high frequency ripples while preserving per-head spectra under Nyquist-valid sampling. Experiments on multiple video understanding benchmarks under matched token budgets show consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead.

Despite its conceptual importance, however, explicit computations of relative entropy remain notoriously difficult. Thus far, results in closed form have only been obtained for ground states, coherent states, and, more recently, single-mode squeezed states. In this work, we extend the analysis to multi-mode squeezed states, imposing that the squeezing generators be local either in space or in spacetime, which results in a continuum of squeezed modes. We provide a detailed and self-contained analysis of such states for a free scalar quantum field on Minkowski spacetime, connecting also with older results on the essential self-adjointness of the Wick square, and showing that they lie in the folium of the Minkowski vacuum representation. Although the local squeezing is natural from a foundational standpoint, we uncover a severe incompatibility between locality and squeezing: the relative entropy between a locally squeezed state and the vacuum generally diverges, however small the squeezing is. This shows that while locally squeezed states are well-defined elements of the state space of a free quantum field, they are infinitely different from the vacuum, in contrast to coherent states whose relative entropy with respect to the vacuum is finite.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u591a\u6a21\u538b\u7f29\u6001\u4e0e\u771f\u7a7a\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u71b5\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u53d1\u6563\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u538b\u7f29\u5f88\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u76f8\u5bf9\u71b5\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u4e2d\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f88\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u4ee5\u524d\u53ea\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fc7\u57fa\u6001\u3001\u76f8\u5e72\u6001\u548c\u5355\u6a21\u538b\u7f29\u6001\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u71b5\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u591a\u6a21\u538b\u7f29\u6001\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u71b5\u3002", "method": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u5c40\u90e8\uff08\u7a7a\u95f4\u6216\u65f6\u7a7a\uff09\u538b\u7f29\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u6807\u91cf\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u5728\u95f5\u53ef\u592b\u65af\u57fa\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e0a\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u538b\u7f29\u6001\u4e0e\u771f\u7a7a\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u71b5\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u538b\u7f29\u6001\uff0c\u5176\u4e0e\u771f\u7a7a\u6001\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u71b5\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u53d1\u6563\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u5c40\u90e8\u538b\u7f29\u6001\u4e0e\u771f\u7a7a\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u5927\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e0e\u76f8\u5e72\u6001\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136\u5c40\u90e8\u538b\u7f29\u6001\u5728\u81ea\u7531\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6709\u660e\u786e\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0e\u771f\u7a7a\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u7684\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u903e\u8d8a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002"}}

However, evaluating these policies remains difficult because real-world testing is expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. It also requires frequent environment resets and carries safety risks when deploying unproven policies on physical robots. Manually creating and populating simulation environments with assets for robotic manipulation has not addressed these issues, primarily due to the significant engineering effort required and the often substantial sim-to-real gap, both in terms of physics and rendering. In this paper, we explore the use of action-conditional video generation models as a scalable way to learn world models for policy evaluation. We demonstrate how to incorporate action conditioning into existing pre-trained video generation models. This allows leveraging internet-scale in-the-wild online videos during the pre-training stage, and alleviates the need for a large dataset of paired video-action data, which is expensive to collect for robotic manipulation. Our paper examines the effect of dataset diversity, pre-trained weight and common failure cases for the proposed evaluation pipeline.Our experiments demonstrate that, across various metrics, including policy ranking and the correlation between actual policy values and predicted policy values, these models offer a promising approach for evaluating policies without requiring real-world interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u592a\u957f\uff1b\u6ca1\u8bfb\u6458\u8981", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u800c\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u7684\u521b\u5efa\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e5f\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u5de5\u7a0b\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u7eb3\u5165\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u6392\u540d\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u503c\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u503c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7b49\u5404\u79cd\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u65b9\u9762\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u5f25\u5408\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

We selected open source models based on the most common alignment methods, namely, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). We conducted a systematic analysis using statistical methods to verify how sensitive the Attack Success Rate (ASR) is when we apply variations to prompts designed to elicit inappropriate content from LLMs. Our results show that even small prompt modifications can significantly change the Attack Success Rate (ASR) according to the statistical tests we run, making the models more or less susceptible to types of attack. Critically, our results demonstrate that running existing 'attack benchmarks' alone may not be sufficient to elicit all possible vulnerabilities of both models and alignment methods.

Accurately predicting power outage recovery and impact is key to resilience of power grid. Recent advances in machine learning offer viable frameworks for estimating power outage duration from geospatial and weather data. However, three major challenges are inherent to the task in a real world setting: spatial dependency of the data, spatial heterogeneity of the impact, and moderate event data. We propose a novel approach to estimate the duration of severe weather-induced power outages through Graph Attention Networks (GAT). Our network uses a simple structure from unsupervised pre-training, followed by semi-supervised learning. We use field data from four major hurricanes affecting $501$ counties in eight Southeastern U.S. states.

Powered by an LLM-augmented multimodal domain foundation model for ILs, AIonopedia enables accurate property predictions and incorporates a hierarchical search architecture for molecular screening and design. Trained and evaluated on a newly curated and comprehensive IL dataset, our model delivers superior performance. Complementing these results, evaluations on literature-reported systems indicate that the agent can perform effective IL modification. Moving beyond offline tests, the practical efficacy was further confirmed through real-world wet-lab validation, in which the agent demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities on challenging out-of-distribution tasks, underscoring its ability to accelerate real-world IL discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "AIonopedia\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u5b50\u6db2\u4f53\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u9009\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6e7f\u6cd5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u5b50\u6db2\u4f53\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u53d7\u5230\u6027\u8d28\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e25\u5cfb\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5dee\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAIonopedia\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7531LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u79bb\u5b50\u6db2\u4f53\u53d1\u73b0\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6027\u8d28\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u641c\u7d22\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5b50\u7b5b\u9009\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65b0\u7684\u3001\u5168\u9762\u7684\u79bb\u5b50\u6db2\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u732e\u62a5\u9053\u7684\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u79bb\u5b50\u6db2\u4f53\u6539\u6027\u3002\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6e7f\u6cd5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "AIonopedia\u80fd\u591f\u52a0\u901f\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u79bb\u5b50\u6db2\u4f53\u53d1\u73b0\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9645\u6e7f\u6cd5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

We evaluate the workflow on referring expression grounding (REC), spatial reasoning (Spatial-Map, Spatial-Grid, Spatial-Maze), and BLINK-Jigsaw. Relative to answering open-ended queries directly, quantization to MCQ yields large gains, and True/False binarization provides a consistent additional boost. Across all tasks, the same workflow produces significant improvements, indicating generality. Our theory formalizes how open-ended vision queries can be quantized to MCQs and further binarized into True/False verifications, establishing a hardness ladder. A simple analysis explains why Boolean resolution boosts accuracy. Together, these components yield a simple and unified workflow that emphasizes inference-time design over task-specific training.

In this work, we present a recursive state preparation algorithm that combines logarithmic-depth Dicke state circuits with Hamming weight encoders for efficiently preparing ``leaf-separable\" quantum states. The algorithm is built on binary partition trees, generalized weight distribution blocks (gWDBs), and leaf-level encoders. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm by numerically simulating it on randomly generated target states with between 4 and 15 qubits. Compared to general state preparation approaches which require $O(2^n)$ CX gates, our algorithm achieves a circuit depth of $O(k\\log\\frac{n}{k} + 2^k)$ and uses $O(n(k+2^k))$ two-qubit gates, where $k < n$ denotes the subtree size. We also compare implementations of the algorithm with and without the use of ancilla qubits, providing a detailed analysis of the trade-offs in circuit depth and two-qubit gate counts. These results contribute to scalable state preparation for quantum algorithms that require structured inputs such as Dicke or near-Dicke states.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u72b6\u6001\u5236\u5907\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5bf9\u6570\u6df1\u5ea6Dicke\u72b6\u6001\u7535\u8def\u548c\u6c49\u660e\u6743\u91cd\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5236\u5907\u201c\u53f6\u5b50\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u201d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u5236\u5907\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8c\u5143\u5212\u5206\u6811\u3001\u5e7f\u4e49\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u5e03\u5757\uff08gWDBs\uff09\u548c\u53f6\u5b50\u7ea7\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5bf9\u6570\u6df1\u5ea6Dicke\u72b6\u6001\u7535\u8def\u548c\u6c49\u660e\u6743\u91cd\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u9700\u8981$O(2^n)$ CX\u95e8\u7684\u901a\u7528\u72b6\u6001\u5236\u5907\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728n\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86$O(k\text{log}\frac{n}{k} + 2^k)$\u7684\u7535\u8def\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c$O(n(k+2^k))$\u7684\u53cc\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u95e8\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dk\u662f\u5b50\u6811\u5927\u5c0f\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd8\u5bf9\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u8f85\u52a9\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u9700\u8981Dicke\u6216\u8fd1-Dicke\u7b49\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u5236\u5907\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Consequently, research has focused on evaluating the robustness of LLMs, an essential quality for real-world tasks. In this paper, we employ simple multi-turn follow-up prompts to evaluate models' answer changes, model accuracy dynamics across turns with Markov chains, and examine whether linear probes can predict these changes. Our results show significant vulnerabilities in LLM robustness: a simple \"Think again\" prompt led to an approximate 10% accuracy drop for Gemini 1.5 Flash over nine turns, while combining this prompt with a semantically equivalent reworded question caused a 7.5% drop for Claude 3.5 Haiku. Additionally, we find that model accuracy across turns can be effectively modeled using Markov chains, enabling the prediction of accuracy probabilities over time. This allows for estimation of the model's stationary (long-run) accuracy, which we find to be on average approximately 8% lower than its first-turn accuracy for Gemini 1.5 Flash. Our results from a model's hidden states also reveal evidence that linear probes can help predict future answer changes. Together, these results establish stationary accuracy as a principled robustness metric for interactive settings and expose the fragility of models under repeated questioning.

However, it is hampered by the flaw that current approaches are forced to accept a compromise between performance and privacy: \\textit{transmitting embedding representations risks sensitive data leakage, while sharing only abstract cluster prototypes leads to diminished model accuracy}. To resolve this dilemma, we propose Structural Privacy-Preserving Federated Graph Clustering (SPP-FGC), a novel algorithm that innovatively leverages local structural graphs as the primary medium for privacy-preserving knowledge sharing, thus moving beyond the limitations of conventional techniques. Our framework operates on a clear client-server logic; on the client-side, each participant constructs a private structural graph that captures intrinsic data relationships, which the server then securely aggregates and aligns to form a comprehensive global graph from which a unified clustering structure is derived. The framework offers two distinct modes to suit different needs. SPP-FGC is designed as an efficient one-shot method that completes its task in a single communication round, ideal for rapid analysis. For more complex, unstructured data like images, SPP-FGC+ employs an iterative process where clients and the server collaboratively refine feature representations to achieve superior downstream performance.

There is a substantial risk that some of these decision induce harm to people, by infringing their well-being or their fundamental human rights. The state-of-the-art in AI systems makes little effort with respect to appropriate documentation of the decision process. This obstructs the ability to trace what went into a decision, which in turn is a prerequisite to any attempt of reconstructing a responsibility chain. Specifically, such traceability is linked to a documentation that will stand up in court when determining the cause of some AI-based decision that inadvertently or intentionally violates the law.\n  This paper takes a radical, yet practical, approach to this problem, by enforcing the documentation of each and every component that goes into the training or inference of an automated decision. As such, it presents the first running workflow supporting the generation of tamper-proof, verifiable and exhaustive traces of AI decisions. In doing so, we expand the DBOM concept into an effective running workflow leveraging confidential computing technology.

This work re-thinks this paradigm, introducing a framework built on hierarchical parallelism and progressive adaptation that re-establishes pure autoregression as a top-performing and practical solution. Our approach is embodied in the Hierarchical Parallel Autoregressive ConvNet (HPAC), an ultra-lightweight pre-trained model using a hierarchical factorized structure and content-aware convolutional gating to efficiently capture spatial dependencies. We introduce two key optimizations for practicality: Cache-then-Select Inference (CSI), which accelerates coding by eliminating redundant computations, and Adaptive Focus Coding (AFC), which efficiently extends the framework to high bit-depth images. Building on this efficient foundation, our progressive adaptation strategy is realized by Spatially-Aware Rate-Guided Progressive Fine-tuning (SARP-FT). This instance-level strategy fine-tunes the model for each test image by optimizing low-rank adapters on progressively larger, spatially-continuous regions selected via estimated information density. Experiments on diverse datasets (natural, satellite, medical) validate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art compression.

This primarily results from the small nuclear gyromagnetic ratio and the difficulties in achieving high spin polarization. Here we develop a new approach to investigating the response of hyperpolarized molecular nuclear spins to magnetic fields and demonstrate orders-of-magnitude enhanced magnetic responsivity over state-of-the-art proton and Overhauser magnetometers. Using hyperpolarized molecules with proton spins, we report the realization of magnetic amplification in linear and nonlinear types.

We investigate gender bias dynamics across three generations of recursive text generation using three complementary evaluation frameworks: rule-based pattern matching, embedding-based semantic similarity, and downstream task performance. Experiments with three initial bias levels (0.1, 0.3, 0.6) and four mitigation strategies reveal equilibrium dynamics rather than monotonic amplification. The low initial bias amplifies toward the model's inherent bias level (+36%), whereas the high initial bias decays toward it (-26%). Among mitigation methods, contrastive augmentation, which introduces gender-swapped variants, achieves significant downstream bias reduction (98.8% for low initial bias and 91% on average) despite producing higher embedding-based bias scores.

Code will be available", "summary": "Graph unlearning has emerged as a promising solution for complying with \"the right to be forgotten\" regulations by enabling the removal of sensitive information upon request. However, this solution is not foolproof. The involvement of multiple parties creates new attack surfaces, and residual traces of deleted data can still remain in the unlearned graph neural networks. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to recover the supposedly erased samples, thereby undermining the inherent functionality of graph unlearning. In this work, we propose GraphToxin, the first graph reconstruction attack against graph unlearning. Specifically, we introduce a novel curvature matching module to provide a fine-grained guidance for full unlearned graph recovery. We demonstrate that GraphToxin can successfully subvert the regulatory guarantees expected from graph unlearning - it can recover not only a deleted individual's information and personal links but also sensitive content from their connections, thereby posing substantially more detrimental threats. Furthermore, we extend GraphToxin to multiple node removals under both white-box and black-box setting. We highlight the necessity of a worst-case analysis and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the attack performance under both random and worst-case node removals. This provides a more robust and realistic measure of the vulnerability of graph unlearning methods to graph reconstruction attacks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of GraphToxin. Notably, we show that existing defense mechanisms are largely ineffective against this attack and, in some cases, can even amplify its performance.

We present CLUE (Controllable Latent space of Unprompted Embeddings), a generative model framework that achieves diverse generation while maintaining stability through fixed-format prompts without requiring any additional data. Based on the Stable Diffusion architecture, CLUE employs a Style Encoder that processes images and prompts to generate style embeddings, which are subsequently fed into a new second attention layer of the U-Net architecture. Through Kullback-Leibler divergence, the latent space achieves continuous representation of image features within Gaussian regions, independent of prompts. Performance was assessed on otitis media dataset. CLUE reduced FID to 9.30 (vs. 46.81) and improved recall to 70.29% (vs. 49.60%). A classifier trained on synthetic-only data at 1000% scale achieved an F1 score of 83.21% (vs. 73.83%). Combining synthetic data with equal amounts of real data achieved an F1 score of 94.76%, higher than when using only real data. On an external dataset, synthetic-only training achieved an F1 score of 76.77% (vs. 60.61%) at 1000% scale. The combined approach achieved an F1 score of 85.78%, higher than when using only the internal dataset. These results demonstrate that CLUE enables diverse yet stable image generation from limited datasets and serves as an effective data augmentation method for domain-specific applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "CLUE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u683c\u5f0f\u7684\u63d0\u793a\uff08prompt\uff09\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8eStable Diffusion\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u98ce\u683c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u65b0\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u6765\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8868\u793a\u3002\u5728 otitis media \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCLUE\u5728FID\u548cRecall\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u533b\u7597\u7b49\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "CLUE\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u4e8eStable Diffusion\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u98ce\u683c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5d4c\u5165\u88ab\u8f93\u5165\u5230U-Net\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u65b0\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u4e2d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7Kullback-Leibler\u6563\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u533a\u57df\u5185\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728 otitis media \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCLUE\u5c06FID\u964d\u4f4e\u52309.30\uff08\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\u4e3a46.81\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06Recall\u63d0\u9ad8\u523070.29%\uff08\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\u4e3a49.60%\uff09\u3002\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u57281000%\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8683.21%\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff08\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\u4e3a73.83%\uff09\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u7b49\u91cf\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8694.76%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u3002\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u57281000%\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8676.77%\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff08\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\u4e3a60.61%\uff09\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8685.78%\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5185\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "CLUE\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this paper, we use the systems' preference bias to study their hidden language: During the process of compressing the input images (typically containing multiple concepts) into texts and then reconstructing them into images, the systems' inherent preference bias introduces specific shifts in the outputs, disrupting the original input concept co-occurrence. We employ the multi-round \"telephone game\" to strategically leverage this bias. By observing the co-occurrence frequencies of concepts in telephone games, we quantitatively investigate the concept connection strength in the understanding of multimodal systems, i.e., \"hidden language.\" We also contribute Telescope, a dataset of 10,000+ concept pairs, as the database of our telephone game framework. Our telephone game is test-time scalable: By iteratively running telephone games, we can construct a global map of concept connections in multimodal systems' understanding. Here we can identify preference bias inherited from training, assess generalization capability advancement, and discover more stable pathways for fragile concept connections. Furthermore, we use Reasoning-LLMs to uncover unexpected concept relationships that transcend textual and visual similarities, inferring how multimodal systems understand and simulate the world.

Fundamentally, aligning LVLMs is not just a safety challenge but a problem of economic efficiency. Current alignment methods struggle with the trade-off between safety, utility, and operational costs. Critically, a focus solely on final outputs (process-blindness) wastes significant computational budget on unsafe deliberation. This flaw allows harmful reasoning to be disguised with benign justifications, thereby circumventing simple additive safety scores. To address this, we propose EcoAlign, an inference-time framework that reframes alignment as an economically rational search by treating the LVLM as a boundedly rational agent. EcoAlign incrementally expands a thought graph and scores actions using a forward-looking function (analogous to net present value) that dynamically weighs expected safety, utility, and cost against the remaining budget. To prevent deception, path safety is enforced via the weakest-link principle. Extensive experiments across 3 closed-source and 2 open-source models on 6 datasets show that EcoAlign matches or surpasses state-of-the-art safety and utility at a lower computational cost, thereby offering a principled, economical pathway to robust LVLM alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "EcoAlign \u901a\u8fc7\u5c06 LVLM \u89c6\u4e3a\u6709\u754c\u7406\u6027\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5c06\u5bf9\u9f50\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7406\u6027\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3 LVLM \u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u6f0f\u6d1e\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6548\u7528\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6548\u7528\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\uff08\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76f2\u89c6\uff09\u4f1a\u6d6a\u8d39\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u6709\u5bb3\u63a8\u7406\u4f2a\u88c5\u6210\u826f\u6027\u7406\u7531\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9003\u907f\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7d2f\u52a0\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6570\u3002", "method": "EcoAlign \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06 LVLM \u89c6\u4e3a\u6709\u754c\u7406\u6027\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u671f\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6548\u7528\u548c\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u5269\u4f59\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u2018\u6700\u8584\u5f31\u73af\u8282\u2019\u539f\u5219\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u6765\u589e\u91cf\u5730\u6269\u5c55\u601d\u7ef4\u56fe\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "EcoAlign \u5728 3 \u4e2a\u95ed\u6e90\u548c 2 \u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u53ca 6 \u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEcoAlign \u4ee5\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "EcoAlign \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5927\u7684 LVLM \u5bf9\u9f50\u3002"}}

However, their effectiveness significantly declines in real-world situations where certain modalities are missing or unavailable. This degradation primarily stems from inconsistent representation learning between complete multimodal data and incomplete modality scenarios. Existing approaches typically address missing modalities through relatively simplistic generation methods, yet these approaches fail to adequately preserve cross-modal consistency, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework named PROMISE, a PROMpting-Attentive HIerarchical ContraStive LEarning approach designed explicitly for robust cross-modal representation under conditions of missing modalities. Specifically, PROMISE innovatively incorporates multimodal prompt learning into a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, equipped with a specially designed prompt-attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically generates robust and consistent representations for scenarios where particular modalities are absent, thereby effectively bridging the representational gap between complete and incomplete data.

The origin of this tension can be traced back mainly to the introduction of the measurement processes and the corresponding wave function reduction, which play a crucial role in Quantum Mechanics. We approach this problem within a recent proposal for a model of Quantum Mechanics, where the measurement is explicitly described as a specific stochastic process. This implements ordinary Quantum Mechanics, where measurement and reduction are treated as phenomenological events of unknown origin without any physical justification. To state clearly the question, we first discuss and establish the effect of a Lorentz transformation on a generic wave function in space-time. This allows to formulate the relativistic version of the model.

Although they are indispensable to evaluate model performance on various tasks, it is uncertain whether the models trained on Internet data have genuinely learned how to solve problems or merely seen the questions before. This potential data contamination issue presents a fundamental challenge to establishing trustworthy evaluation frameworks. Meanwhile, existing benchmarks predominantly assume benign, resource-rich settings, leaving the behavior of LLMs under pressure unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Squid Game, a dynamic and adversarial evaluation environment with resource-constrained and asymmetric information settings elaborated to evaluate LLMs through interactive gameplay against other LLM opponents. Notably, Squid Game consists of six elimination-style levels, focusing on multi-faceted abilities, such as instruction-following, code, reasoning, planning, and safety alignment. We evaluate over 50 LLMs on Squid Game, presenting the largest behavioral evaluation study of general LLMs on dynamic adversarial scenarios. We observe a clear generational phase transition on performance in the same model lineage and find evidence that some models resort to speculative shortcuts to win the game, indicating the possibility of higher-level evaluation paradigm contamination in static benchmarks. Furthermore, we compare prominent LLM benchmarks and Squid Game with correlation analyses, highlighting that dynamic evaluation can serve as a complementary part for static evaluations.

However, slow sampling speed is an essential challenge for recent developed DM-based schemes. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel flow matching (FM)-based generative model for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel estimation. We first formulate the channel estimation problem within FM framework, where the conditional probability path is constructed from the noisy channel distribution to the true channel distribution. In this case, the path evolves along the straight-line trajectory at a constant speed. Then, guided by this, we derive the velocity field that depends solely on the noise statistics to guide generative models training. Furthermore, during the sampling phase, we utilize the trained velocity field as prior information for channel estimation, which allows for quick and reliable noise channel enhancement via ordinary differential equation (ODE) Euler solver. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed FM-based channel estimation scheme can significantly reduce the sampling overhead compared to other popular DM-based schemes, such as the score matching (SM)-based scheme. Meanwhile, it achieves superior channel estimation accuracy under different channel conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff08CSI\uff09\u83b7\u53d6\u5bf9\u4e8e\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08DM\uff09\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff08FM\uff09\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u8f93\u5165\u591a\u8f93\u51fa\uff08MIMO\uff09\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u6784\u5efa\u5728FM\u6846\u67b6\u5185\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u4fe1\u9053\u5206\u5e03\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u4fe1\u9053\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u566a\u58f0\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u666e\u901a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08ODE\uff09\u6b27\u62c9\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u4fe1\u9053\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684FM\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u5f00\u9500\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f97\u5206\u5339\u914d\uff08SM\uff09\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u6d41\u884cDM\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4fe1\u9053\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "FM\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u6bb5\u5185\u4ee5\u6052\u5b9a\u901f\u5ea6\u6f14\u5316\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u8f68\u8ff9\u6765\u89e3\u51b3DM\u91c7\u6837\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002"}}

While rule-based approaches offer interpretability through predefined psychological principles, they often lack generalizability and flexibility. Conversely, data-driven methods can learn complex behaviors from large-scale datasets, but are typically inefficient, opaque, and difficult to align with human intuitions. To bridge this gap, we propose RLSLM, a hybrid Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model, grounded in empirical behavioral experiments, into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework. The social locomotion model generates an orientation-sensitive social comfort field that quantifies human comfort across space, enabling socially aligned navigation policies with minimal training. RLSLM then jointly optimizes mechanical energy and social comfort, allowing agents to avoid intrusions into personal or group space. A human-agent interaction experiment using an immersive VR-based setup demonstrates that RLSLM outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further show the model's significantly improved interpretability over conventional data-driven methods.

Although emotion analysis has made progress in the visual domain, the video community lacks dedicated resources to bridge emotion understanding with generative tasks, particularly for stylized and non-realistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce EmoVid, the first multimodal, emotion-annotated video dataset specifically designed for creative media, which includes cartoon animations, movie clips, and animated stickers. Each video is annotated with emotion labels, visual attributes (brightness, colorfulness, hue), and text captions. Through systematic analysis, we uncover spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions across diverse video forms. Building on these insights, we develop an emotion-conditioned video generation technique by fine-tuning the Wan2.1 model. The results show a significant improvement in both quantitative metrics and the visual quality of generated videos for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. EmoVid establishes a new benchmark for affective video computing.

Autonomous robots performing precise liquid manipulation tasks, such as dispensing, aspiration, and mixing, must handle containers in ways that inevitably induce these deformations, complicating accurate liquid state assessment. Current datasets lack comprehensive physics-informed simulation data representing realistic liquid behaviors under diverse dynamic scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Phys-Liquid, a physics-informed dataset comprising 97,200 simulation images and corresponding 3D meshes, capturing liquid dynamics across multiple laboratory scenes, lighting conditions, liquid colors, and container rotations. To validate the realism and effectiveness of Phys-Liquid, we propose a four-stage reconstruction and estimation pipeline involving liquid segmentation, multi-view mask generation, 3D mesh reconstruction, and real-world scaling. Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy and consistency in reconstructing liquid geometry and volume, outperforming existing benchmarks. The dataset and associated validation methods facilitate future advancements in transparent liquid perception tasks.

A Case of Politeness and Speech Rate", "comment": null, "summary": "Voice-based artificial intelligence is increasingly expected to adhere to human social conventions, but can it learn implicit cues that are not explicitly programmed? This study investigates whether state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems have internalized the human tendency to reduce speech rate to convey politeness - a non-obvious prosodic marker. We prompted 22 synthetic voices from two leading AI platforms (AI Studio and OpenAI) to read a fixed script under both \"polite and formal\" and \"casual and informal\" conditions and measured the resulting speech duration. Across both AI platforms, the polite prompt produced slower speech than the casual prompt with very large effect sizes, an effect that was statistically significant for all of AI Studio's voices and for a large majority of OpenAI's voices. These results demonstrate that AI can implicitly learn and replicate psychological nuances of human communication, highlighting its emerging role as a social actor capable of reinforcing human social norms.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\u8bed\u97f3\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u201c\u793c\u8c8c\u201d\u8bed\u5883\u4e0b\u4f1a\u6bd4\u201c\u968f\u610f\u201d\u8bed\u5883\u4e0b\u8bf4\u5f97\u66f4\u6162\uff0c\u8868\u660eAI\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u590d\u5236\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ea4\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u522b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76AI\u8bed\u97f3\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u50cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u5728\u8868\u8fbe\u793c\u8c8c\u65f6\u653e\u6162\u8bed\u901f\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u590d\u5236\u8fd9\u79cd\u975e\u663e\u6027\u7684\u97f5\u5f8b\u6807\u8bb0\u3002", "method": "\u8ba922\u4e2a\u6765\u81eaAI Studio\u548cOpenAI\u7684\u5408\u6210\u8bed\u97f3\u5728\u201c\u793c\u8c8c\u6b63\u5f0f\u201d\u548c\u201c\u968f\u610f\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\u201d\u4e24\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6717\u8bfb\u56fa\u5b9a\u811a\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bed\u97f3\u65f6\u957f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2aAI\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\uff0c\u793c\u8c8c\u63d0\u793a\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u6bd4\u968f\u610f\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u8bed\u901f\u66f4\u6162\uff0c\u6548\u5e94\u91cf\u975e\u5e38\u5927\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5bf9AI Studio\u7684\u6240\u6709\u8bed\u97f3\u548c\u5927\u90e8\u5206OpenAI\u8bed\u97f3\u90fd\u5177\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u663e\u8457\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u80fd\u591f\u5185\u9690\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u590d\u5236\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ea4\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u522b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5f3a\u5316\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u59cb\u626e\u6f14\u793e\u4f1a\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

This has sparked recent interest in controllable model merging, giving users the ability to explicitly balance performance trade-offs. Existing approaches employ a compile-then-query paradigm, performing a costly offline multi-objective optimization to enable fast, preference-aware model generation. This offline stage typically involves iterative search or dedicated training, with complexity that grows exponentially with the number of tasks. To overcome these limitations, we shift the perspective from parameter-space optimization to a direct correction of the model's final representation. Our approach models this correction as an optimal linear transformation, yielding a closed-form solution that replaces the entire offline optimization process with a single-step, architecture-agnostic computation. This solution directly incorporates user preferences, allowing a Pareto-optimal model to be generated on-the-fly with complexity that scales linearly with the number of tasks.

However, existing MIL methods face critical limitations: (1) they rely on attention mechanisms that lack causal interpretability, and (2) they fail to integrate patient demographics (age, gender, race), leading to fairness concerns across diverse populations. These shortcomings hinder clinical translation, where algorithmic bias can exacerbate health disparities. We introduce \\textbf{MeCaMIL}, a causality-aware MIL framework that explicitly models demographic confounders through structured causal graphs. Unlike prior approaches treating demographics as auxiliary features, MeCaMIL employs principled causal inference -- leveraging do-calculus and collider structures -- to disentangle disease-relevant signals from spurious demographic correlations. Extensive evaluation on three benchmarks demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across CAMELYON16 (ACC/AUC/F1: 0.939/0.983/0.946), TCGA-Lung (0.935/0.979/0.931), and TCGA-Multi (0.977/0.993/0.970, five cancer types). Critically, MeCaMIL achieves superior fairness -- demographic disparity variance drops by over 65% relative reduction on average across attributes, with notable improvements for underserved populations. The framework generalizes to survival prediction (mean C-index: 0.653, +0.017 over best baseline across five cancer types). Ablation studies confirm causal graph structure is essential -- alternative designs yield 0.048 lower accuracy and 4.2x times worse fairness. These results establish MeCaMIL as a principled framework for fair, interpretable, and clinically actionable AI in digital pathology.

In this work, we explore the potential and limitations of variational quantum algorithms in solving the particle track reconstruction problem. We present an analysis of two distinct formulations for identifying straight-line tracks in a multilayer detection system, inspired by the LHCb vertex detector. The first approach is formulated as a ground-state energy problem, while the second approach is formulated as a system of linear equations. This work addresses one of the main challenges when dealing with variational quantum algorithms on general problems, namely designing an expressive and efficient quantum ansatz working on tracking events with fixed detector geometry. For this purpose, we employed a quantum architecture search method based on Monte Carlo Tree Search to design the quantum circuits for different problem sizes. We provide experimental results to test our approach on both formulations for different problem sizes in terms of performance and computational cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u80fd\u7269\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u6311\u6218\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7c92\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u91cd\u5efa\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u80fd\u7269\u7406\u9886\u57df\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7c92\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u91cd\u5efa\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u7c92\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u6001\u80fd\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u7684\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ec4\u7684\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff08MCTS\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u95ee\u9898\u89c4\u6a21\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u95ee\u9898\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u7c92\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u91cd\u5efa\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7ebf\u8def\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

This paper focuses on 6D pose estimation of strawberries using purely synthetic data generated through a procedural pipeline for photorealistic rendering. We employ the YOLOX-6D-Pose algorithm, a single-shot approach that leverages the YOLOX backbone, known for its balance between speed and accuracy, and its support for edge inference. To address the lacking availability of training data, we introduce a robust and flexible pipeline for generating synthetic strawberry data from various 3D models via a procedural Blender pipeline, where we focus on enhancing the realism of the synthesized data in comparison to previous work to make it a valuable resource for training pose estimation algorithms. Quantitative evaluations indicate that our models achieve comparable accuracy on both the NVIDIA RTX 3090 and Jetson Orin Nano across several ADD-S metrics, with the RTX 3090 demonstrating superior processing speed. However, the Jetson Orin Nano is particularly suited for resource-constrained environments, making it an excellent choice for deployment in agricultural robotics. Qualitative assessments further confirm the model's performance, demonstrating its capability to accurately infer the poses of ripe and partially ripe strawberries, while facing challenges in detecting unripe specimens. This suggests opportunities for future improvements, especially in enhancing detection capabilities for unripe strawberries (if desired) by exploring variations in color. Furthermore, the methodology presented could be adapted easily for other fruits such as apples, peaches, and plums, thereby expanding its applicability and impact in the field of agricultural automation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528YOLOX-6D-Pose\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u7eaf\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8349\u8393\u76846D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3a\u519c\u4e1a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5148\u8fdb\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u4e2d\u519c\u4e1a\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u77ed\u7f3a\u548c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6c34\u679c\u91c7\u6458\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316Blender\u7ba1\u7ebf\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u8349\u8393\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528YOLOX-6D-Pose\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c6D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5728RTX 3090\u548cJetson Orin Nano\u4e0a\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u6bd4\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0cRTX 3090\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\uff0cJetson Orin Nano\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u6210\u719f\u548c\u534a\u6210\u719f\u8349\u8393\u7684\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u672a\u6210\u719f\u8349\u8393\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u548c6D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8349\u8393\u91c7\u6458\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u6613\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u6c34\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u519c\u4e1a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, the limited output length of LLMs constrains the depth of reasoning attainable in a single inference process. Multi-agent reasoning systems offer a promising alternative by employing multiple agents including Solver, Verifier, and Corrector, to iteratively refine solutions. While effective in closed-source models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, they struggle to generalize to open-source models due to insufficient critic and correction capabilities. To address this, we propose MarsRL, a novel reinforcement learning framework with agentic pipeline parallelism, designed to jointly optimize all agents in the system. MarsRL introduces agent-specific reward mechanisms to mitigate reward noise and employs pipeline-inspired training to enhance efficiency in handling long trajectories. Applied to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507, MarsRL improves AIME2025 accuracy from 86.5% to 93.3% and BeyondAIME from 64.9% to 73.8%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507.

This limitation highlights the absence of a quantitative measure of how much these models actually use visual information during reasoning. We propose Draft and Refine (DnR), an agent framework driven by a question-conditioned utilization metric. The metric quantifies the model's reliance on visual evidence by first constructing a query-conditioned relevance map to localize question-specific cues and then measuring dependence through relevance-guided probabilistic masking. Guided by this metric, the DnR agent refines its initial draft using targeted feedback from external visual experts. Each expert's output (such as boxes or masks) is rendered as visual cues on the image, and the model is re-queried to select the response that yields the largest improvement in utilization. This process strengthens visual grounding without retraining or architectural changes. Experiments across VQA and captioning benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains and reduced hallucination, demonstrating that measuring visual utilization provides a principled path toward more interpretable and evidence-driven multimodal agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "LVLM\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u56de\u7b54\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u6216\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDraft and Refine (DnR)\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u6761\u4ef6\u5229\u7528\u7387\u6307\u6807\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u56fe\u8c31\u6765\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6982\u7387\u63a9\u7801\u6765\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002DnR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5916\u90e8\u89c6\u89c9\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728VQA\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684LVLM\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u56de\u7b54\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u6216\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u91cf\u5316\u5176\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDraft and Refine (DnR)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u6761\u4ef6\u5229\u7528\u7387\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u56fe\u8c31\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6982\u7387\u63a9\u7801\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002DnR\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u89c6\u89c9\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "result": "\u5728VQA\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDnR\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u5229\u7528\u7387\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

In this work, we demonstrate spatially resolved single-shot measurements of photon number distributions using difference-frequency generation (DFG) in a nonlinear BBO crystal. We show that our platform can discriminate between coherent and thermal photon statistics across two spatial dimensions with picosecond resolution. At the same time, we find that the retrieved distributions deviate from the ideal ones, a consequence of vacuum contamination and the multimodal response of the amplifier. To explain this, we develop a temporal mode decomposition framework that captures the essential physics of signal amplification and fluorescence, and quantitatively reproduces the experimental findings.

This is the extended version of the paper accepted at AAAI 2026, which includes all technical appendices and additional experimental details", "summary": "This paper systematically examines nation-level biases exhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs) within the domain of International Relations (IR). Leveraging historical records from the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), we developed a bias evaluation framework comprising three distinct tests to explore nation-level bias in various LLMs, with a particular focus on the five permanent members of the UNSC. Experimental results show that, even with the general bias patterns across models (e.g., favorable biases toward the western nations, and unfavorable biases toward Russia), these still vary based on the LLM. Notably, even within the same LLM, the direction and magnitude of bias for a nation change depending on the evaluation context. This observation suggests that LLM biases are fundamentally multidimensional, varying across models and tasks. We also observe that models with stronger reasoning abilities show reduced bias and better performance. Building on this finding, we introduce a debiasing framework that improves LLMs' factual reasoning combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Reflexion-based self-reflection techniques. Experiments show it effectively reduces nation-level bias, and improves performance, particularly in GPT-4o-mini and LLama-3.3-70B.

Most UDA approaches emphasize transfer ability, but often overlook robustness against adversarial attacks. Although vanilla adversarial training (VAT) improves the robustness of deep neural networks, it has little effect on UDA. This paper focuses on answering three key questions: 1) Why does VAT, known for its defensive effectiveness, fail in the UDA paradigm? 2) What is the generalization bound theory under attacks and how does it evolve from classical UDA theory? 3) How can we implement a robustification training procedure without complex modifications? Specifically, we explore and reveal the inherent entanglement challenge in general UDA+VAT paradigm, and propose an unsupervised robust domain adaptation (URDA) paradigm. We further derive the generalization bound theory of the URDA paradigm so that it can resist adversarial noise and domain shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to establish the URDA paradigm and theory. We further introduce a simple, novel yet effective URDA algorithm called Disentangled Adversarial Robustness Training (DART), a two-step training procedure that ensures both transferability and robustness. DART first pre-trains an arbitrary UDA model, and then applies an instantaneous robustification post-training step via disentangled distillation.Experiments on four benchmark datasets with/without attacks show that DART effectively enhances robustness while maintaining domain adaptability, and validate the URDA paradigm and theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aURDA\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u9002\u5e94\uff08UDA\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u8fb9\u754c\u7406\u8bba\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDART\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u84b8\u998f\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684UDA\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709UDA\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u5173\u6ce8\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08VAT\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u5bf9UDA\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76VAT\u5728UDA\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faURDA\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86DART\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002DART\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1a1. \u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u610fUDA\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2. \u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u84b8\u998f\u8fdb\u884c\u5373\u65f6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eDART\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86URDA\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "URDA\u8303\u5f0f\u548cDART\u7b97\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86UDA\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

However, most existing approaches assume that communication is instantaneous, reliable, and has unlimited bandwidth; these conditions are rarely met in real-world deployments. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in robust and efficient communication strategies for MARL under realistic constraints, including message perturbations, transmission delays, and limited bandwidth. Furthermore, because the challenges of low-latency reliability, bandwidth-intensive data sharing, and communication-privacy trade-offs are central to practical MARL systems, we focus on three applications involving cooperative autonomous driving, distributed simultaneous localization and mapping, and federated learning. Finally, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, advocating a unified approach that co-designs communication, learning, and robustness to bridge the gap between theoretical MARL models and practical implementations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u901a\u4fe1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff08\u5982\u6d88\u606f\u6270\u52a8\u3001\u4f20\u8f93\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u6709\u9650\u5e26\u5bbd\uff09\u7684MARL\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u901a\u4fe1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u4e86\u5408\u4f5c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fSLAM\u548c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684MARL\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u901a\u4fe1\u662f\u77ac\u65f6\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e14\u5e26\u5bbd\u65e0\u9650\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5f88\u5c11\u89c1\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u901a\u4fe1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684MARL\u901a\u4fe1\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8c03\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u56de\u987e\u4e86MARL\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u901a\u4fe1\u7b56\u7565\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u4e86\u6d88\u606f\u6270\u52a8\u3001\u4f20\u8f93\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u6709\u9650\u5e26\u5bbd\u7b49\u73b0\u5b9e\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u91cd\u70b9\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u5408\u4f5c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fSLAM\u548c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd\u9650\u5236\u7b49\u73b0\u5b9e\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0cMARL\u901a\u4fe1\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5f25\u5408\u7406\u8bbaMARL\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5171\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Drawing inspiration from human cognitive memory theory, which distinguishes short-term visually-dominant memory and long-term semantically-dominant memory, we propose VisMem, a cognitively-aligned framework that equips VLMs with dynamic latent vision memories, a short-term module for fine-grained perceptual retention and a long-term module for abstract semantic consolidation. These memories are seamlessly invoked during inference, allowing VLMs to maintain both perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency across thinking and generation. Extensive experiments across diverse visual benchmarks for understanding, reasoning, and generation reveal that VisMem delivers a significant average performance boost of 11.8% relative to the vanilla model and outperforms all counterparts, establishing a new paradigm for latent-space memory enhancement.

As in the case of its digital gate-based counterpart, designing digital-analog circuits that employ optimal quantum resources often requires an exceedingly large classical computational time. In this work we find a suboptimal solution to this exponentially large problem, showing that it can be solved within polynomial computational time.

The periodic structure provides predictable coverage of distant tokens, while the sparse footprint keeps the per-layer complexity linear in context length. We prove that \\PiAttention achieves $\\mathcal{O}(kL + \u03c0\\log L)$ receptive field growth compared to $\\mathcal{O}(kL)$ for RingAttention, where $k$ is the local window size, $\u03c0$ is the skip period, and $L$ is the sequence length. Extensive experiments on language modeling, retrieval, and vision-language tasks demonstrate that \\PiAttention matches or surpasses dense attention quality with 8.3\\% lower perplexity than RingAttention while using 50\\% fewer GPUs for the same context length.

In the literature, classical GNNs may be classified into three variants: convolutional, attentional, and message-passing. While the standard message-passing variant is highly expressive, its typical pair-wise messages nevertheless only consider the features of the center node and each neighboring node individually. This design fails to incorporate the rich contextual information contained within the broader local neighborhood, potentially hindering its ability to learn complex relationships within the entire set of neighboring nodes. To address this limitation, this work first formalizes the concept of neighborhood-contextualization, rooted in a key property of the attentional variant. This then serves as the foundation for generalizing the message-passing variant to the proposed neighborhood-contextualized message-passing (NCMP) framework. To demonstrate its utility, a simple, practical, and efficient method to parametrize and operationalize NCMP is presented, leading to the development of the proposed Soft-Isomorphic Neighborhood-Contextualized Graph Convolution Network (SINC-GCN). A preliminary analysis on a synthetic binary node classification problem then underscores both the expressivity and efficiency of the proposed GNN architecture.

CURENet has been capable of capturing the intricate interaction between different forms of clinical data and creating a more reliable predictive model for chronic illnesses. We evaluated CURENet using the public MIMIC-III and private FEMH datasets, where it achieved over 94\\% accuracy in predicting the top 10 chronic conditions in a multi-label framework. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal EHR integration to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.", "AI": {"tldr": "CURENet\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\u3001\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u548cTransformer\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6162\u6027\u75c5\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5728MIMIC-III\u548cFEMH\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8694%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\uff08EHR\uff09\u4e2d\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u5982\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\u3001\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\uff09\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3001\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u533b\u751f\u505a\u51fa\u660e\u667a\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "CURENet\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\u3001\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ee5\u53ca\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5904\u7406\u4e34\u5e8a\u6587\u672c\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5316\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5904\u7406\u7eb5\u5411\u5e8f\u5217\u8bbf\u95ee\u3002", "result": "CURENet\u5728MIMIC-III\u548cFEMH\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u9884\u6d4b\u6392\u540d\u524d10\u7684\u6162\u6027\u75c5\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc794%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001EHR\u96c6\u6210\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u60a3\u8005\u9884\u540e\u3002"}}

One of the most important is the quantum coherence of the emitted single photons, which can be compromised by fast dephasing and spectral diffusion. In hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), blue-emitting color centers (or B centers) are seen as favorable in this regard, in the light of prior studies mainly based on resonant excitation. Yet, their coherence properties in the more accessible regime of non-resonant excitation (or photoluminescence) has not been extensively characterized. Here, we investigate the coherence and spectral diffusion of the photoluminescence from a B center in the continuous wave regime using photon correlation Fourier spectroscopy. We determine that the emission lineshape consists in a homogeneous contribution, whose linewidth increases with the laser power, and which is broadened by spectral diffusion at a timescale of 10 to 100 microseconds. At low power and short time, the emission line is only a factor ~2 above the Fourier limit, while at long times, the inhomogeneous linewidth increases up to more than a gigahertz.

On the other hand, systems that adapt more flexibly require offline optimization and remain static once deployed. We present Experience-Guided Reasoner (EGuR), which generates tailored strategies -- complete computational procedures involving LLM calls, tools, sampling parameters, and control logic -- dynamically at inference time based on accumulated experience. We achieve this using an LLM-based meta-strategy -- a strategy that outputs strategies -- enabling adaptation of all strategy components (prompts, sampling parameters, tool configurations, and control logic). EGuR operates through two components: a Guide generates multiple candidate strategies conditioned on the current problem and structured memory of past experiences, while a Consolidator integrates execution feedback to improve future strategy generation. This produces complete, ready-to-run strategies optimized for each problem, which can be cached, retrieved, and executed as needed without wasting resources. Across five challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, 3-SAT, and three Big Bench Extra Hard tasks), EGuR achieves up to 14% accuracy improvements over the strongest baselines while reducing computational costs by up to 111x, with both metrics improving as the system gains experience.", "AI": {"tldr": "EGuR\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08\u5305\u62ecLLM\u8c03\u7528\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u3001\u91c7\u6837\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u903b\u8f91\uff09\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u96be\u4ee5\u6839\u636e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u4fee\u6539\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7075\u6d3b\u6539\u53d8\u91c7\u6837\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6216\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aEGuR\uff08Experience-Guided Reasoner\uff09\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u201c\u5143\u7b56\u7565\u201d\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b56\u7565\u3002EGuR\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e2a\u201c\u5f15\u5bfc\u8005\u201d\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u5f53\u524d\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u7ecf\u9a8c\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u201c\u5de9\u56fa\u8005\u201d\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u6267\u884c\u53cd\u9988\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "EGuR\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8614%\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86111\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u968f\u7740\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u79ef\u7d2f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u90fd\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "EGuR\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86AI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Under review", "summary": "Skip-connected encoder-decoder architectures (U-Net variants) are widely adopted for inverse problems but still suffer from information loss, limiting recovery of fine high-frequency details. We present Selectively Suppressed Perfect Reconstruction (SUPER), which exploits the perfect reconstruction (PR) property of wavelets to prevent information degradation while selectively suppressing (SS) redundant features. Free from rigid framelet constraints, SUPER serves as a plug-and-play decoder block for diverse U-Net variants, eliminating their intrinsic reconstruction bottlenecks and enhancing representational richness. Experiments across diverse crack benchmarks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrate the structural potential of the proposed SUPER Decoder Block. Maintaining comparable computational cost, SUPER enriches representational diversity through increased parameterization. In small-scale in-domain experiments on the CrackVision12K dataset, SUPER markedly improves thin-crack segmentation performance, particularly for cracks narrower than 4 px, underscoring its advantage in high-frequency dominant settings. In smartphone image denoising on SIDD, where low-frequency components prevail, SUPER still achieves a moderate gain in PSNR, confirming its robustness across low- and high-frequency regimes.

Employing the LHCb vertex locator as a case study we investigate a novel approach for charged particle track reconstruction. The algorithm hinges on minimizing an Ising-like Hamiltonian using matrix inversion. Solving this matrix inversion classically achieves reconstruction efficiencies akin to current state-of-the-art algorithms. Exploiting the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) quantum algorithm for linear systems holds the promise of an exponential speedup in the number of input hits over its classical counterpart, contingent on the conditions of efficient quantum phase estimation (QPE) and effectively reading out the algorithm's output. This contribution builds on previous work by Nicotra et al and strives to fulfill these conditions and further streamlines the algorithm's circuit depth by a factor up to $10^4$. Our version of the HHL algorithm restricts the QPE precision to one bit, largely reducing circuit depth and addressing HHL's readout issue. Furthermore, this allows for the implementation of a post-processing algorithm that reconstructs event Primary Vertices (PVs). The findings presented here aim to further illuminate the potential of harnessing quantum computing for the future of particle track reconstruction in high-energy physics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u80fd\u7269\u7406\u4e8b\u4ef6\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u4eae\u5ea6LHC\u4e8b\u4ef6\u91cd\u5efa\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528HHL\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u7535\u8def\u6df1\u5ea6\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u6bd4\u7279\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u4f4d\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08QPE\uff09\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5e26\u7535\u7c92\u5b50\u5f84\u8ff9\u91cd\u5efa\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e26\u7535\u7c92\u5b50\u5f84\u8ff9\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7b97\u6cd5\u91cd\u5efa\u4e8b\u4ef6\u521d\u7ea7\u9876\u70b9\uff08PVs\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u672a\u6765\u9ad8\u80fd\u7269\u7406\u7c92\u5b50\u5f84\u8ff9\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

It focuses on the generalization ability of agents, requiring them to coordinate well with collaborators that are not seen before without any fine-tuning. Population-based training has been proven to provide good zero-shot coordination performance; nevertheless, existing methods are limited by computational resources, mainly focusing on optimizing diversity in small populations while neglecting the potential performance gains from scaling population size. To address this issue, this paper proposes the Scalable Population Training (ScaPT), an efficient training framework comprising two key components: a meta-agent that efficiently realizes a population by selectively sharing parameters across agents, and a mutual information regularizer that guarantees population diversity.

Agents trained solely to achieve their objectives may adopt harmful behavior, exposing a key trade-off between maximizing the reward function and maintaining the alignment. For the pre-trained agents, ensuring alignment is particularly challenging, as retraining can be a costly and slow process. This is further complicated by the diverse and potentially conflicting attributes representing the ethical values for alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a test-time alignment technique based on model-guided policy shaping. Our method allows precise control over individual behavioral attributes, generalizes across diverse reinforcement learning (RL) environments, and facilitates a principled trade-off between ethical alignment and reward maximization without requiring agent retraining. We evaluate our approach using the MACHIAVELLI benchmark, which comprises 134 text-based game environments and thousands of annotated scenarios involving ethical decisions. The RL agents are first trained to maximize the reward in their respective games. At test time, we apply policy shaping via scenario-action attribute classifiers to ensure decision alignment with ethical attributes.

This gap is critical, as multi-drone systems provide enhanced coverage, robustness, and collaboration compared to single-sensor setups. Existing multi-image benchmarks mainly target basic perception tasks using high-quality single-agent images, thus failing to evaluate MLLMs in more complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios, especially under real-world degraded perception conditions.To address these challenges, we introduce AirCopBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging perceptual conditions. AirCopBench includes 14.6k+ questions derived from both simulator and real-world data, spanning four key task dimensions: Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, and Collaborative Decision, across 14 task types. We construct the benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control. Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks. Fine-tuning experiments further confirm the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer in aerial collaborative perception and reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "AirCopBench\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b14.6k+\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u534f\u540c\u51b3\u7b56\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u3001\u4ee5\u81ea\u6211\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u5728\u591a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u964d\u7ea7\u611f\u77e5\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u3001\u4ee5\u81ea\u6211\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u573a\u666f\u8bc4\u4f30\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u591a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u534f\u540c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30MLLMs\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "AirCopBench\u5305\u542b14.6k+\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6765\u6e90\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e86\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u534f\u540c\u51b3\u7b56\u56db\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u517114\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u3002\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u964d\u7ea7\u611f\u77e5\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u91c7\u96c6\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u534f\u540c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u3001\u89c4\u5219\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728AirCopBench\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cMLLMs\u5728\u534f\u540c\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5f97\u5206\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f4e24.38%\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u5fae\u8c03\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u822a\u7a7a\u534f\u540c\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AirCopBench\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524dMLLMs\u5728\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMLLMs\u5728\u534f\u540c\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4ecd\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u8fc1\u79fb\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u3002"}}

While previous studies have benchmarked the humor capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have often relied on single-dimensional evaluations, such as judging whether something is simply ``funny.'' This paper argues that a multifaceted understanding of humor is necessary and addresses this gap by systematically evaluating LLMs through the lens of Oogiri, a form of Japanese improvisational comedy games. To achieve this, we expanded upon existing Oogiri datasets with data from new sources and then augmented the collection with Oogiri responses generated by LLMs. We then manually annotated this expanded collection with 5-point absolute ratings across six dimensions: Novelty, Clarity, Relevance, Intelligence, Empathy, and Overall Funniness. Using this dataset, we assessed the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on two core tasks: their ability to generate creative Oogiri responses and their ability to evaluate the funniness of responses using a six-dimensional evaluation. Our results show that while LLMs can generate responses at a level between low- and mid-tier human performance, they exhibit a notable lack of Empathy. This deficit in Empathy helps explain their failure to replicate human humor assessment. Correlation analyses of human and model evaluation data further reveal a fundamental divergence in evaluation criteria: LLMs prioritize Novelty, whereas humans prioritize Empathy. We release our annotated corpus to the community to pave the way for the development of more emotionally intelligent and sophisticated conversational agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65e5\u672c\u5927\u559c\u5229\u559c\u5267\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u5e7d\u9ed8\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u5728\u521b\u9020\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u5c1a\u53ef\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5171\u60c5\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u4fa7\u91cd\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u800c\u975e\u5171\u60c5\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u5e7d\u9ed8\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f80\u5f80\u5355\u4e00\u5316\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u4f53\u73b0\u5e7d\u9ed8\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7279\u6027\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65e5\u672c\u5927\u559c\u5229\u559c\u5267\uff0c\u5bf9LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5e7d\u9ed8\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8LLM\u5728\u5e7d\u9ed8\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u559c\u5229\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u5165LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u5de5\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u3001\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u3001\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u6027\u3001\u5171\u60c5\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u516d\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u3002\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86LLM\u751f\u6210\u5927\u559c\u5229\u56de\u590d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528\u516d\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6765\u5224\u65ad\u56de\u590d\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5927\u559c\u5229\u56de\u590d\u6c34\u5e73\u4ecb\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u4f4e\u4e2d\u7b49\u8868\u73b0\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5171\u60c5\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7f3a\u9677\u3002LLM\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u56de\u590d\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u65f6\uff0c\u66f4\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u65b0\u9896\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5219\u66f4\u770b\u91cd\u5171\u60c5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u4e24\u8005\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u5206\u6b67\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5e7d\u9ed8\u5185\u5bb9\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5171\u60c5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5177\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5e76\u63d0\u5347LLM\u7684\u5171\u60c5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u8c03\u6574\u5176\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e7d\u9ed8\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u4ee5\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u504f\u597d\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Although recent deep learning methods have achieved promising accuracy, existing discriminative models fail to utilize the distributional prior of embryonic development to improve accuracy. Moreover, their reliance on single-focal information leads to incomplete embryonic representations, making them susceptible to feature ambiguity under cell occlusions. To address these limitations, we propose EmbryoDiff, a two-stage diffusion-based framework that formulates the task as a conditional sequence denoising process. Specifically, we first train and freeze a frame-level encoder to extract robust multi-focal features. In the second stage, we introduce a Multi-Focal Feature Fusion Strategy that aggregates information across focal planes to construct a 3D-aware morphological representation, effectively alleviating ambiguities arising from cell occlusions. Building on this fused representation, we derive complementary semantic and boundary cues and design a Hybrid Semantic-Boundary Condition Block to inject them into the diffusion-based denoising process, enabling accurate embryonic stage classification. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results.

Deep vision models, trained on chest X-rays, can now detect not only disease but also invisible traces of social inequality. In this study, we show that state-of-the-art architectures (DenseNet121, SwinV2-B, MedMamba) can predict a patient's health insurance type, a strong proxy for socioeconomic status, from normal chest X-rays with significant accuracy (AUC around 0.67 on MIMIC-CXR-JPG, 0.68 on CheXpert). The signal persists even when age, race, and sex are controlled for, and remains detectable when the model is trained exclusively on a single racial group. Patch-based occlusion reveals that the signal is diffuse rather than localized, embedded in the upper and mid-thoracic regions. This suggests that deep networks may be internalizing subtle traces of clinical environments, equipment differences, or care pathways; learning socioeconomic segregation itself. These findings challenge the assumption that medical images are neutral biological data. By uncovering how models perceive and exploit these hidden social signatures, this work reframes fairness in medical AI: the goal is no longer only to balance datasets or adjust thresholds, but to interrogate and disentangle the social fingerprints embedded in clinical data itself.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u7247\u9884\u6d4b\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u4fdd\u9669\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5730\u4f4d\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u533b\u7597AI\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4ece\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u7247\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5730\u4f4d\u7684\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u533b\u7597\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7acb\u6027\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528DenseNet121\u3001SwinV2-B\u548cMedMamba\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728MIMIC-CXR-JPG\u548cCheXpert\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u5065\u5eb7\u4fdd\u9669\u7c7b\u578b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff08AUC\u7ea6\u4e3a0.67-0.68\uff09\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u4e86\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u79cd\u65cf\u548c\u6027\u522b\u540e\uff0c\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f9d\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u4fe1\u53f7\u662f\u5f25\u6563\u7684\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u80f8\u8154\u7684\u4e0a\u90e8\u548c\u4e2d\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u770b\u4f3c\u6b63\u5e38\u7684\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u7247\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5730\u4f4d\u7684\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u533b\u7597\u56fe\u50cf\u53ef\u80fd\u5185\u5d4c\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u3001\u8bbe\u5907\u5dee\u5f02\u6216\u62a4\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7eaf\u7cb9\u7684\u751f\u7269\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8fd9\u8981\u6c42\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u533b\u7597AI\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u601d\u8003\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8981\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u8fd8\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u7a76\u548c\u89e3\u6790\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u6307\u7eb9\u3002"}}

Do they form shared multilingual representations with language-specific decoding, and if so, why does performance still favor the dominant training language? To address this, we train a series of LLMs on different mixtures of multilingual data and analyze their internal mechanisms using cross-layer transcoders (CLT) and attribution graphs. Our results provide strong evidence for pivot language representations: the model employs nearly identical representations across languages, while language-specific decoding emerges in later layers. Attribution analyses reveal that decoding relies in part on a small set of high-frequency language features in the final layers, which linearly read out language identity from the first layers in the model. By intervening on these features, we can suppress one language and substitute another in the model's outputs. Finally, we study how the dominant training language influences these mechanisms across attribution graphs and decoding pathways. We argue that understanding this pivot-language mechanism is crucial for improving multilingual alignment in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLMs)\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\u4ecd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u540c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684LLMs\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u5c42\u8f6c\u7801\u5668(CLT)\u548c\u5f52\u56e0\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u63a5\u8fd1\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u540e\u671f\u5c42\u7ea7\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u591a\u8bed\u8a00LLMs\u5185\u90e8\u5982\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u504f\u5411\u4f18\u52bf\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u3002", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684LLMs\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u8de8\u5c42\u8f6c\u7801\u5668(CLT)\u548c\u5f52\u56e0\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u63a5\u8fd1\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u89e3\u7801\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u540e\u671f\u5c42\u7ea7\u3002\u540e\u671f\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e00\u5c0f\u7ec4\u9ad8\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ebf\u6027\u8bfb\u51fa\u8bed\u8a00\u8eab\u4efd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5e72\u9884\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u4e00\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u5e76\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u3002\u8fd8\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4f18\u52bf\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u79cd\u67a2\u7ebd\u8bed\u8a00\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u591a\u8bed\u8a00LLMs\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

However, such models must handle control conditions and content generation computational requirements, resulting in generally low generation efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a Hybrid-Grained Cache (HGC) approach that reduces computational overhead by adopting cache strategies with different granularities at different computational stages. Specifically, (1) we use a coarse-grained cache (block-level) based on feature reuse to dynamically bypass redundant computations in encoder-decoder blocks between each step of model reasoning. (2) We design a fine-grained cache (prompt-level) that acts within a module, where the fine-grained cache reuses cross-attention maps within consecutive reasoning steps and extends them to the corresponding module computations of adjacent steps. These caches of different granularities can be seamlessly integrated into each computational link of the controllable generation process. We verify the effectiveness of HGC on four benchmark datasets, especially its advantages in balancing generation efficiency and visual quality. For example, on the COCO-Stuff segmentation benchmark, our HGC significantly reduces the computational cost (MACs) by 63% (from 18.22T to 6.70T), while keeping the loss of semantic fidelity (quantized performance degradation) within 1.5%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u7c92\u5ea6\u7f13\u5b58\uff08HGC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\uff08\u5757\u7ea7\uff09\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\uff08\u63d0\u793a\u7ea7\uff09\u7f13\u5b58\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u63a7\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u666e\u904d\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u7c92\u5ea6\u7f13\u5b58\uff08HGC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1. \u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7f13\u5b58\uff08\u5757\u7ea7\uff09\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u590d\u7528\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u7ed5\u8fc7\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5757\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u30022. \u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7f13\u5b58\uff08\u63d0\u793a\u7ea7\uff09\uff1a\u5728\u6a21\u5757\u5185\u90e8\uff0c\u91cd\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u76f8\u90bb\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u76f8\u5e94\u6a21\u5757\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86HGC\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5728COCO-Stuff\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cHGC\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff08MACs\uff09\u4ece18.22T\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u52306.70T\uff08\u964d\u4f4e63%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff08\u91cf\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff09\u57281.5%\u4ee5\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "HGC\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, models often rely on annotations that reflect dominant cultural norms, limiting model ability to recognize emotional expression in dialects often excluded from training data distributions, such as African American Vernacular English (AAVE). This study examines emotion recognition model performance on AAVE compared to General American English (GAE). We analyze 2.7 million tweets geo-tagged within Los Angeles. Texts are scored for strength of AAVE using computational approximations of dialect features. Annotations of emotion presence and intensity are collected on a dataset of 875 tweets with both high and low AAVE densities. To assess model accuracy on a task as subjective as emotion perception, we calculate community-informed \"silver\" labels where AAVE-dense tweets are labeled by African American, AAVE-fluent (ingroup) annotators. On our labeled sample, GPT and BERT-based models exhibit false positive prediction rates of anger on AAVE more than double than on GAE. SpanEmo, a popular text-based emotion model, increases false positive rates of anger from 25 percent on GAE to 60 percent on AAVE. Additionally, a series of linear regressions reveals that models and non-ingroup annotations are significantly more correlated with profanity-based AAVE features than ingroup annotations.

This paper has been accepted by IJCNN 2025 but not published", "summary": "Automatic segmentation methods of polyps is crucial for assisting doctors in colorectal polyp screening and cancer diagnosis. Despite the progress made by existing methods, polyp segmentation faces several challenges: (1) small-sized polyps are prone to being missed during identification, (2) the boundaries between polyps and the surrounding environment are often ambiguous, (3) noise in colonoscopy images, caused by uneven lighting and other factors, affects segmentation results. To address these challenges, this paper introduces coupling gates as components in specific modules to filter noise and perform feature importance selection. Three modules are proposed: the coupling gates multiscale feature extraction (CGMFE) module, which effectively extracts local features and suppresses noise; the windows cross attention (WCAD) decoder module, which restores details after capturing the precise location of polyps; and the decoder feature aggregation (DFA) module, which progressively aggregates features, further extracts them, and performs feature importance selection to reduce the loss of small-sized polyps.

We address this limitation by first aligning the models' parameter spaces, leveraging the inherent permutation, rotation, and scaling symmetries of Transformer architectures. We adapt parameter space alignment for modern Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) and SwiGLU layers, exploring both weight-based and activation-based approaches. Using this alignment-first strategy, we successfully transfer advanced reasoning skills to a non-reasoning model. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms standard task arithmetic.

To enhance transparency while maintaining accuracy, we developed an interpretable deep learning framework for short-term precipitation prediction in four major Indian cities: Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata, spanning diverse climate zones. We implemented a hybrid Time-Distributed CNN-ConvLSTM (Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory) architecture, trained on multi-decadal ERA5 reanalysis data. The architecture was optimized for each city with a different number of convolutional filters: Bengaluru (32), Mumbai and Delhi (64), and Kolkata (128). The models achieved root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.21 mm/day (Bengaluru), 0.52 mm/day (Mumbai), 0.48 mm/day (Delhi), and 1.80 mm/day (Kolkata). Through interpretability analysis using permutation importance, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), temporal occlusion, and counterfactual perturbation, we identified distinct patterns in the model's behavior. The model relied on city-specific variables, with prediction horizons ranging from one day for Bengaluru to five days for Kolkata.

However, their ability to generalize compositionally across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type remains underexplored. We introduce CrossMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate compositional generalization (CG) in medical multimodal LLMs using a structured Modality-Anatomy-Task (MAT) schema. CrossMed reformulates four public datasets, CheXpert (X-ray classification), SIIM-ACR (X-ray segmentation), BraTS 2020 (MRI classification and segmentation), and MosMedData (CT classification) into a unified visual question answering (VQA) format, resulting in 20,200 multiple-choice QA instances. We evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs, LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B, on both Related and Unrelated MAT splits, as well as a zero-overlap setting where test triplets share no Modality, Anatomy, or Task with the training data. Models trained on Related splits achieve 83.2 percent classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU, while performance drops significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, demonstrating the benchmark difficulty.

Under review at IWSDS 2026", "summary": "LLMs are increasingly employed as judges across a variety of tasks, including those involving everyday social interactions. Yet, it remains unclear whether such LLM-judges can reliably assess tasks that require social or conversational judgment. We investigate how an LLM's conviction is changed when a task is reframed from a direct factual query to a Conversational Judgment Task. Our evaluation framework contrasts the model's performance on direct factual queries with its assessment of a speaker's correctness when the same information is presented within a minimal dialogue, effectively shifting the query from \"Is this statement correct?\" to \"Is this speaker correct?\". Furthermore, we apply pressure in the form of a simple rebuttal (\"The previous answer is incorrect.\") to both conditions. This perturbation allows us to measure how firmly the model maintains its position under conversational pressure. Our findings show that while some models like GPT-4o-mini reveal sycophantic tendencies under social framing tasks, others like Llama-8B-Instruct become overly-critical. We observe an average performance change of 9.24% across all models, demonstrating that even minimal dialogue context can significantly alter model judgment, underscoring conversational framing as a key factor in LLM-based evaluation.

Chamon"], "title": "Adaptive Symmetrization of the KL Divergence", "comment": null, "summary": "Many tasks in machine learning can be described as or reduced to learning a probability distribution given a finite set of samples. A common approach is to minimize a statistical divergence between the (empirical) data distribution and a parameterized distribution, e.g., a normalizing flow (NF) or an energy-based model (EBM). In this context, the forward KL divergence is a ubiquitous due to its tractability, though its asymmetry may prevent capturing some properties of the target distribution. Symmetric alternatives involve brittle min-max formulations and adversarial training (e.g., generative adversarial networks) or evaluating the reverse KL divergence, as is the case for the symmetric Jeffreys divergence, which is challenging to compute from samples. This work sets out to develop a new approach to minimize the Jeffreys divergence. To do so, it uses a proxy model whose goal is not only to fit the data, but also to assist in optimizing the Jeffreys divergence of the main model. This joint training task is formulated as a constrained optimization problem to obtain a practical algorithm that adapts the models priorities throughout training. We illustrate how this framework can be used to combine the advantages of NFs and EBMs in tasks such as density estimation, image generation, and simulation-based inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6770\u592b\u745e\u6563\u5ea6\uff08Jeffreys divergence\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8f85\u52a9\u4e3b\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u6784\u9020\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9NF\u548cEBM\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u88ab\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e3a\u4ece\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6563\u5ea6\u3002\u524d\u5411KL\u6563\u5ea6\u56e0\u5176\u6613\u5904\u7406\u6027\u800c\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u67d0\u4e9b\u7279\u6027\u3002\u5bf9\u79f0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5982\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GANs\uff09\u6216\u53cd\u5411KL\u6563\u5ea6\uff08\u5982\u5bf9\u79f0\u6770\u592b\u745e\u6563\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d77\u6765\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6770\u592b\u745e\u6563\u5ea6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u62df\u5408\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fd8\u8981\u8f85\u52a9\u4e3b\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u6770\u592b\u745e\u6563\u5ea6\u3002\u8be5\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u88ab\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u7ed3\u5408NF\u548cEBM\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eff\u771f\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6770\u592b\u745e\u6563\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86NF\u548cEBM\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, current methods face two major challenges: Hierarchy Representation Collapse (HRC) and Redundancy-Induced Saliency Dilution (RISD). HRC compresses abstract-to-specific and whole-to-part hierarchies in Euclidean embeddings, while RISD averages noisy fragments, obscuring critical semantic cues and diminishing the model's ability to distinguish hard negatives. To address these challenges, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Alignment Reasoning Network (H$^{2}$ARN) for text-3D retrieval. H$^{2}$ARN embeds both text and 3D data in a Lorentz-model hyperbolic space, where exponential volume growth inherently preserves hierarchical distances. A hierarchical ordering loss constructs a shrinking entailment cone around each text vector, ensuring that the matched 3D instance falls within the cone, while an instance-level contrastive loss jointly enforces separation from non-matching samples. To tackle RISD, we propose a contribution-aware hyperbolic aggregation module that leverages Lorentzian distance to assess the relevance of each local feature and applies contribution-weighted aggregation guided by hyperbolic geometry, enhancing discriminative regions while suppressing redundancy without additional supervision. We also release the expanded T3DR-HIT v2 benchmark, which contains 8,935 text-to-3D pairs, 2.6 times the original size, covering both fine-grained cultural artefacts and complex indoor scenes.

Previous research has focused on detecting and addressing negative attention heads that induce negative bias. However, the underlying detailed factors influencing negative bias remain underexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit format-level negative bias, meaning the prompt format more influences their responses than the semantics of the negative response. For the fine-grained study of the negative bias, we introduce a pipeline for constructing the evaluation set, which systematically categorizes the dataset into three subsets based on the model's parametric knowledge: correct, incorrect, and insufficient relevant knowledge. Through analysis of this evaluation set, we identify a shortcut behavior in which models tend to generate negative responses when they lack sufficient knowledge to answer a yes-no question, leading to negative bias. We further examine how negative bias changes under various prompting scenarios related to parametric knowledge.

By making a machine-learning based weather forecasting model generative and applying this non-linear aggregation method, we achieve better accuracy in predicting extreme heat events than with the typical mean prediction from the same model.

Supplementary material included after references. 27 pages, 21 figures, 11 tables", "summary": "4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a reliable, non-invasive approach for estimating blood flow velocities, vital for cardiovascular diagnostics. Unlike conventional MRI focused on anatomical structures, 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of critical conditions such as stenosis or aneurysms. However, achieving such resolution typically results in prolonged scan times, creating a trade-off between acquisition speed and prediction accuracy. Recent studies have leveraged physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for super-resolution of MRI data, but their practical applicability is limited as the prohibitively slow training process must be performed for each patient. To overcome this limitation, we propose PINGS-X, a novel framework modeling high-resolution flow velocities using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations. Inspired by the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) in novel view synthesis, PINGS-X extends this concept through several non-trivial novel innovations: (i) normalized Gaussian splatting with a formal convergence guarantee, (ii) axes-aligned Gaussians that simplify training for high-dimensional data while preserving accuracy and the convergence guarantee, and (iii) a Gaussian merging procedure to prevent degenerate solutions and boost computational efficiency. Experimental results on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and real 4D flow MRI datasets demonstrate that PINGS-X substantially reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy.

However, existing methods rely on weight-based merging, where one LoRA often dominates the other, leading to interference and degraded fidelity. This interference is structural: separately trained LoRAs occupy low-rank high-dimensional subspaces, leading to non-orthogonal and overlapping representations. In this work, we analyze the internal structure of LoRAs and find their generative behavior is dominated by a few principal directions in the low-rank subspace, which should remain free from interference during fusion. To achieve this, we propose Null Space Projection LoRA (NP-LoRA), a projection-based framework for LoRA fusion that enforces subspace separation to prevent structural interference among principal directions. Specifically, we first extract principal style directions via singular value decomposition (SVD) and then project the subject LoRA into its orthogonal null space. Furthermore, we introduce a soft projection mechanism that enables smooth control over the trade-off between subject fidelity and style consistency.

The rapid development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has established them as one of the mainstream approaches for multi-view clustering. Despite significant progress in GNNs-based IMVC, some challenges remain: (1) Most methods rely on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to construct static graphs from raw data, which introduces noise and diminishes the robustness of the graph topology. (2) Existing methods typically utilize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss between the reconstructed graph and the sparse adjacency graph directly as the graph reconstruction loss, leading to substantial gradient noise during optimization. To address these issues, we propose a novel \\textbf{D}ynamic Deep \\textbf{G}raph Learning for \\textbf{I}ncomplete \\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{V}iew \\textbf{C}lustering with \\textbf{M}asked Graph Reconstruction Loss (DGIMVCM). Firstly, we construct a missing-robust global graph from the raw data. A graph convolutional embedding layer is then designed to extract primary features and refined dynamic view-specific graph structures, leveraging the global graph for imputation of missing views. This process is complemented by graph structure contrastive learning, which identifies consistency among view-specific graph structures.

Gary Chan"], "title": "LoRaCompass: Robust Reinforcement Learning to Efficiently Search for a LoRa Tag", "comment": null, "summary": "The Long-Range (LoRa) protocol, known for its extensive range and low power, has increasingly been adopted in tags worn by mentally incapacitated persons (MIPs) and others at risk of going missing. We study the sequential decision-making process for a mobile sensor to locate a periodically broadcasting LoRa tag with the fewest moves (hops) in general, unknown environments, guided by the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). While existing methods leverage reinforcement learning for search, they remain vulnerable to domain shift and signal fluctuation, resulting in cascading decision errors that culminate in substantial localization inaccuracies. To bridge this gap, we propose LoRaCompass, a reinforcement learning model designed to achieve robust and efficient search for a LoRa tag. For exploitation under domain shift and signal fluctuation, LoRaCompass learns a robust spatial representation from RSSI to maximize the probability of moving closer to a tag, via a spatially-aware feature extractor and a policy distillation loss function.

Existing acceleration methods face a fundamental trade-off: dynamically estimating sparse attention patterns at each denoising step incurs high computational overhead and estimation errors, while static sparsity patterns remain fixed and often suboptimal throughout denoising. We identify a key structural property of diffusion attention, namely, its sparsity patterns exhibit strong temporal coherence across denoising steps. Tiles deemed non-essential at step $t$ typically remain so at step $t+\u03b4$. Leveraging this observation, we introduce LiteAttention, a method that exploits temporal coherence to enable evolutionary computation skips across the denoising sequence. By marking non-essential tiles early and propagating skip decisions forward, LiteAttention eliminates redundant attention computations without repeated profiling overheads, combining the adaptivity of dynamic methods with the efficiency of static ones. We implement a highly optimized LiteAttention kernel on top of FlashAttention and demonstrate substantial speedups on production video diffusion models, with no degradation in quality.

However, FL methods typically run for a predefined number of global rounds, often leading to unnecessary computation when optimal performance is reached earlier. In addition, training may continue even when the model fails to achieve meaningful performance.

A small dataset of 600 sentences labeled with six cognitive categories - Knowledge, Comprehension, Application, Analysis, Synthesis, and Evaluation - was processed using traditional machine learning (ML) models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines), recurrent neural network architectures (LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, BiGRU), transformer-based models (BERT and RoBERTa), and large language models (OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, Anthropic). Each model was evaluated under different preprocessing and augmentation strategies (for example, synonym replacement, word embeddings, etc.). Among traditional ML approaches, Support Vector Machines (SVM) with data augmentation achieved the best overall performance, reaching 94 percent accuracy, recall, and F1 scores with minimal overfitting. In contrast, the RNN models and BERT suffered from severe overfitting, while RoBERTa initially overcame it but began to show signs as training progressed. Finally, zero-shot evaluations of large language models (LLMs) indicated that OpenAI and Gemini performed best among the tested LLMs, achieving approximately 0.72-0.73 accuracy and comparable F1 scores. These findings highlight the challenges of training complex deep models on limited data and underscore the value of careful data augmentation and simpler algorithms (such as augmented SVM) for Bloom's Taxonomy classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

To achieve this, existing methods have leveraged the powerful cross-modal generation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focusing on optimizing cross-modal alignment between radiographs and reports through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, by only performing instance-level alignment with the image-text pairs, the standard SFT paradigm fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment, where the templated nature of reports often leads to sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose \\textsc{S2D-Align}, a novel SFT paradigm that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment by leveraging auxiliary signals of varying granularities. \\textsc{S2D-Align} implements a shallow-to-deep strategy, progressively enriching the alignment process: it begins with the coarse radiograph-report pairing, then introduces reference reports for instance-level guidance, and ultimately utilizes key phrases to ground the generation in specific anatomical details. To bridge the different alignment stages, we introduce a memory-based adapter that empowers feature sharing, thereby integrating coarse and fine-grained guidance. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on the public \\textsc{MIMIC-CXR} and \\textsc{IU X-Ray} benchmarks, where \\textsc{S2D-Align} achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.

We evaluated CNN and autoencoder architectures for user authentication through simple digit patterns (0-9) traced with finger input. Twenty participants contributed 2,000 finger-drawn digits each on personal touchscreen devices. We compared two CNN architectures: a modified Inception-V1 network and a lightweight shallow CNN for mobile environments. Additionally, we examined Convolutional and Fully Connected autoencoders for anomaly detection. Both CNN architectures achieved ~89% authentication accuracy, with the shallow CNN requiring fewer parameters. Autoencoder approaches achieved ~75% accuracy. The results demonstrate that finger-drawn symbol authentication provides a viable, secure, and user-friendly biometric solution for touchscreen devices.

While these translations demand discourse-level coherence and strict terminological precision, current evaluation methods predominantly focus on segment-level accuracy and fluency. To address this limitation, we introduce DiscoX, a new benchmark for discourse-level and expert-level Chinese-English translation. It comprises 200 professionally-curated texts from 7 domains, with an average length exceeding 1700 tokens. To evaluate performance on DiscoX, we also develop Metric-S, a reference-free system that provides fine-grained automatic assessments across accuracy, fluency, and appropriateness. Metric-S demonstrates strong consistency with human judgments, significantly outperforming existing metrics. Our experiments reveal a remarkable performance gap: even the most advanced LLMs still trail human experts on these tasks. This finding validates the difficulty of DiscoX and underscores the challenges that remain in achieving professional-grade machine translation.

Among these, direct preference optimization (DPO) has emerged as a widely adopted technique that fine-tunes LLMs on preferred completions over less favorable ones. While most frontier LLMs do not disclose their curated preference pairs, the broader LLM community has released several open-source DPO datasets, including TuluDPO, ORPO, UltraFeedback, HelpSteer, and Code-Preference-Pairs. However, systematic comparisons remain scarce, largely due to the high computational cost and the lack of rich quality annotations, making it difficult to understand how preferences were selected, which task types they span, and how well they reflect human judgment on a per-sample level. In this work, we present the first comprehensive, data-centric analysis of popular open-source DPO corpora. We leverage the Magpie framework to annotate each sample for task category, input quality, and preference reward, a reward-model-based signal that validates the preference order without relying on human annotations. This enables a scalable, fine-grained inspection of preference quality across datasets, revealing structural and qualitative discrepancies in reward margins.

However, it remains vulnerable to sophisticated data poisoning attacks targeting local features, labels, smashed data, and model weights. Existing defenses, primarily adapted from traditional Federated Learning (FL), are less effective under SFL due to limited access to complete model updates. This paper presents HealSplit, the first unified defense framework tailored for SFL, offering end-to-end detection and recovery against five sophisticated types of poisoning attacks. HealSplit comprises three key components: (1) a topology-aware detection module that constructs graphs over smashed data to identify poisoned samples via topological anomaly scoring (TAS); (2) a generative recovery pipeline that synthesizes semantically consistent substitutes for detected anomalies, validated by a consistency validation student; and (3) an adversarial multi-teacher distillation framework trains the student using semantic supervision from a Vanilla Teacher and anomaly-aware signals from an Anomaly-Influence Debiasing (AD) Teacher, guided by the alignment between topological and gradient-based interaction matrices. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that HealSplit consistently outperforms ten state-of-the-art defenses, achieving superior robustness and defense effectiveness across diverse attack scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "HealSplit\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9SFL\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6062\u590d\u4e94\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728SFL\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3aSFL\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u8bbf\u95ee\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u800cSFL\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u9488\u5bf9\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "method": "HealSplit\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1. \u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u90e8\u5206\u6570\u636e\u56fe\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u62d3\u6251\u5f02\u5e38\u8bc4\u5206\uff08TAS\uff09\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u6709\u6bd2\u6837\u672c\u30022. \u751f\u6210\u6062\u590d\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\uff0c\u5e76\u7531\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u30023. \u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u591a\u6559\u5e08\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Vanilla Teacher\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76d1\u7763\u548cAnomaly-Influence Debiasing (AD) Teacher\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u611f\u77e5\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHealSplit\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5341\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u6548\u679c\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "HealSplit\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9SFL\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u591f\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6062\u590d\u591a\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86SFL\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

For decades traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been state-of-the-art for precipitation forecasting. However, physically-parameterized models suffer from a few core limitations: first, solving PDEs to resolve atmospheric dynamics is computationally demanding, and second, these methods degrade in performance at nowcasting timescales (i.e., 0-4 hour lead-times). Motivated by these shortcomings, recent work proposes AI-weather prediction (AI-WP) alternatives that learn to emulate analysis data with neural networks. While these data-driven approaches have enjoyed enormous success across diverse spatial and temporal resolutions, applications of video-understanding architectures for weather forecasting remain underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose SaTformer: a video transformer built on full space-time attention that skillfully forecasts extreme precipitation from satellite radiances. Along with our novel architecture, we introduce techniques to tame long-tailed precipitation datasets. Namely, we reformulate precipitation regression into a classification problem, and employ a class-weighted loss to address label imbalances.

NASK leverages an exponential transformation of the Gower similarity coefficient to jointly model numerical and categorical features efficiently, and employs star substructures enhanced by Weisfeiler-Lehman iterations to integrate multi-scale neighborhood structural information. We theoretically prove that NASK is positive definite, ensuring compatibility with kernel-based learning frameworks such as SVMs. Extensive experiments are conducted on eleven attributed and four large-scale real-world graph benchmarks. The results demonstrate that NASK consistently achieves superior performance over sixteen state-of-the-art baselines, including nine graph kernels and seven Graph Neural Networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "NASK\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u56fe\u6838\uff0c\u5b83\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86Gower\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7cfb\u6570\u548cWeisfeiler-Lehman\u8fed\u4ee3\u6765\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u5c5e\u6027\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u90bb\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u56fe\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u5f02\u6784\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u65f6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u5c5e\u6027\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u90bb\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aNASK\uff08Neighborhood-Aware Star Kernel\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u56fe\u6838\u3002NASK\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86Gower\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u6307\u6570\u53d8\u6362\uff08\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u6570\u503c\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u5c5e\u6027\uff09\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u661f\u5f62\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u901a\u8fc7Weisfeiler-Lehman\u8fed\u4ee3\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u90bb\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b11\u4e2a\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u548c4\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cNASK\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e16\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5305\u62ec9\u4e2a\u56fe\u6838\u548c7\u4e2a\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "NASK\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u56fe\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, CT is costly and impractical for large-scale screening, while chest X-rays (CXRs) are inexpensive but lack reliable ground truth labels, constraining deep learning development. Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) offer a scalable alternative by projecting CT volumes into CXR-like images while inheriting precise labels. In this work, we provide the first systematic evaluation of DRRs as a surrogate training domain for CAC detection. Using 667 CT scans from the COCA dataset, we generate synthetic DRRs and assess model capacity, super-resolution fidelity enhancement, preprocessing, and training strategies. Lightweight CNNs trained from scratch outperform large pretrained networks; pairing super-resolution with contrast enhancement yields significant gains; and curriculum learning stabilises training under weak supervision. Our best configuration achieves a mean AUC of 0.754, comparable to or exceeding prior CXR-based studies.

Predictive models using electronic health records (EHRs), which capture large-scale longitudinal patient-level health information, may provide a more effective tool for identifying high-risk groups by detecting subtle prediagnostic signals of cancer. Recent advances in large language and foundation models have further expanded this potential, yet evidence remains limited on how useful HER-based models are compared with traditional risk factors currently used in screening guidelines. We systematically evaluated the clinical utility of EHR-based predictive models against traditional risk factors, including gene mutations and family history of cancer, for identifying high-risk individuals across eight major cancers (breast, lung, colorectal, prostate, ovarian, liver, pancreatic, and stomach), using data from the All of Us Research Program, which integrates EHR, genomic, and survey data from over 865,000 participants. Even with a baseline modeling approach, EHR-based models achieved a 3- to 6-fold higher enrichment of true cancer cases among individuals identified as high risk compared with traditional risk factors alone, whether used as a standalone or complementary tool. The EHR foundation model, a state-of-the-art approach trained on comprehensive patient trajectories, further improved predictive performance across 26 cancer types, demonstrating the clinical potential of EHR-based predictive modeling to support more precise and scalable early detection strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\uff08EHR\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u764c\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u764c\u75c7\u7b5b\u67e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u764c\u75c7\u7b5b\u67e5\u6307\u5357\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u72ed\u7a84\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4e2a\u4f53\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\uff08EHR\uff09\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u6d4b\u764c\u75c7\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4eba\u7fa4\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u201cAll of Us\u201d\u7814\u7a76\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eEHR\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u56e0\u7a81\u53d8\u548c\u764c\u75c7\u5bb6\u65cf\u53f2\u5728\u5185\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u516b\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u764c\u75c7\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4e2a\u4f53\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u6548\u7528\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u751a\u81f3\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eEHR\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5373\u4f7f\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4f20\u7edf\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eEHR\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4eba\u7fa4\u4e2d\uff0c\u771f\u5b9e\u764c\u75c7\u75c5\u4f8b\u7684\u5bcc\u96c6\u5ea6\u4e5f\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e863\u52306\u500d\u3002\u57fa\u4e8eEHR\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8626\u79cd\u764c\u75c7\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eEHR\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u764c\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u65b9\u9762\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

This paper proposes a few-shot learning approach leveraging contrastive learning to detect bark beetle infestations using satellite PRISMA hyperspectral data. The methodology is based on a contrastive learning framework to pre-train a one-dimensional CNN encoder, enabling the extraction of robust feature representations from hyperspectral data. These extracted features are subsequently utilized as input to support vector regression estimators, one for each class, trained on few labeled samples to estimate the proportions of healthy, attacked by bark beetle, and dead trees for each pixel. Experiments on the area of study in the Dolomites show that our method outperforms the use of original PRISMA spectral bands and of Sentinel-2 data.

In this work, we investigate the trade-off between expressiveness and latency in MTP within the framework of probabilistic circuits (PCs). Our framework, named MTPC, allows one to explore different ways to encode the joint distributions over future tokens by selecting different circuit architectures, generalising classical models such as (hierarchical) mixture models, hidden Markov models and tensor networks. We show the efficacy of MTPC by retrofitting existing byte-level LLMs, such as EvaByte. Our experiments show that, when combined with speculative decoding, MTPC significantly speeds up generation compared to MTP with independence assumptions, while guaranteeing to retain the performance of the original verifier LLM.

Advances in deep learning and transformer-based models, particularly BERT and large language models (LLMs) have created new opportunities for automated detection of harmful language. Motivated by these developments, we present a framework for analysing personal attacks in U.S. presidential debates. Our work involves manual annotation of debate transcripts across the 2016, 2020 and 2024 election cycles, followed by statistical and language-model based analysis. We investigate the potential of fine-tuned transformer models alongside general-purpose LLMs to detect personal attacks in formal political speech.

Conventional backpropagation (BP)-based training requires storing layer activations and optimizer states, a demand that can be only partially alleviated through checkpointing. In edge deployments in which the model weights must reside entirely in device memory, this overhead severely limits the maximum model size that can be deployed. Memory-efficient zeroth-order optimization (MeZO) alleviates this bottleneck by estimating gradients using forward evaluations alone, eliminating the need for storing intermediate activations or optimizer states.

This has sparked growing interest in Meme Emotion Understanding (MEU), which aims to classify the emotional intent behind memes by leveraging their multimodal contents. While existing efforts have achieved promising results, two major challenges remain: (1) a lack of fine-grained multimodal fusion strategies, and (2) insufficient mining of memes' implicit meanings and background knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose MemoDetector, a novel framework for advancing MEU. First, we introduce a four-step textual enhancement module that utilizes the rich knowledge and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to progressively infer and extract implicit and contextual insights from memes. These enhanced texts significantly enrich the original meme contents and provide valuable guidance for downstream classification. Next, we design a dual-stage modal fusion strategy: the first stage performs shallow fusion on raw meme image and text, while the second stage deeply integrates the enhanced visual and textual features. This hierarchical fusion enables the model to better capture nuanced cross-modal emotional cues. Experiments on two datasets, MET-MEME and MOOD, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, MemoDetector improves F1 scores by 4.3\\% on MET-MEME and 3.4\\% on MOOD. Further ablation studies and in-depth analyses validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, highlighting its strong potential for advancing MEU.

However, most computational models treat genes as isolated numerical features, ignoring the rich biological semantics encoded in their symbols. This prevents a truly deep understanding of critical biological characteristics. To overcome this limitation, we present SemST, a semantic-guided deep learning framework for spatial transcriptomics data clustering. SemST leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable genes to \"speak\" through their symbolic meanings, transforming gene sets within each tissue spot into biologically informed embeddings. These embeddings are then fused with the spatial neighborhood relationships captured by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), achieving a coherent integration of biological function and spatial structure. We further introduce the Fine-grained Semantic Modulation (FSM) module to optimally exploit these biological priors. The FSM module learns spot-specific affine transformations that empower the semantic embeddings to perform an element-wise calibration of the spatial features, thus dynamically injecting high-order biological knowledge into the spatial context.

Then we self-distill Hindsight-Zero into Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Generator and Knowledge Generator, enabling the generation of sequential steps and discrete facts. Secondly, to tackle the misalignment between knowledge correctness and confidence, we optimize the Knowledge Generator with KEPO, preferring under-confident but helpful knowledge over the over-confident but unhelpful one. The generated CoT and sampled knowledge are then exploited for answer prediction. Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA validate the effectiveness of HinD, showing that HinD with elicited reasoning from 7B-size MLLM achieves superior performance without commercial model APIs or outside knowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "KBVQA \u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7 Hindsight Distilled Reasoning (HinD) \u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528 MLLM \u7684\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408 Knowledge Encouragement Preference Optimization (KEPO) \u6765\u4f18\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5728 OK-VQA \u548c A-OKVQA \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684 KBVQA \u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56 MLLM \u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u5229\u7528 MLLM \u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Hindsight Distilled Reasoning (HinD) \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u5206\uff1a1.

This challenge arises primarily due to constrained model context windows and the sparsity of relevant information within extensive contextual noise. To solve this, we propose the SAP$^{2}$ method, a novel framework that dynamically prunes and integrates relevant contextual keywords in two stages. Specifically, each stage leverages our proposed Speech-Driven Attention-based Pooling mechanism, enabling efficient compression of context embeddings while preserving speech-salient information. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of SAP$^{2}$ on the SlideSpeech and LibriSpeech datasets, achieving word error rates (WER) of 7.71% and 1.12%, respectively. On SlideSpeech, our method notably reduces biased keyword error rates (B-WER) by 41.1% compared to non-contextual baselines. SAP$^{2}$ also exhibits robust scalability, consistently maintaining performance under extensive contextual input conditions on both datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "SAP\u00b2\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u4fee\u526a\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\uff08ASR\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9700\u8981\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\uff08ASR\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5e38\u89c1\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9700\u8981\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u573a\u666f\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u4f1a\u8bae\u6f14\u793a\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u7a00\u758f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSAP\u00b2\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u4fee\u526a\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u90fd\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u97f3\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6c60\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "SAP\u00b2\u5728SlideSpeech\u548cLibriSpeech\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff08WER\uff09\u5206\u522b\u4e3a7.71%\u548c1.12%\u3002\u5728SlideSpeech\u4e0a\uff0cSAP\u00b2\u5c06\u504f\u501a\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff08B-WER\uff09\u76f8\u6bd4\u975e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u57fa\u7ebf\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8641.1%\u3002", "conclusion": "SAP\u00b2\u5728SlideSpeech\u548cLibriSpeech\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8f93\u5165\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u59cb\u7ec8\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

Treating the parametric microstructure as design variables, batched first-order optimization with a single surrogate matches target tensors within a few percent and returns diverse near-optimal designs.

To address these issues, we propose a novel I2I translation framework, OT-ALD, grounded in optimal transport (OT) theory, which retains the strengths of DDIB-based approach. Specifically, we compute an OT map from the latent distribution of the source domain to that of the target domain, and use the mapped distribution as the starting point for the reverse diffusion process in the target domain. Our error analysis confirms that OT-ALD eliminates latent distribution mismatches. Moreover, OT-ALD effectively balances faster image translation with improved image quality. Experiments on four translation tasks across three high-resolution datasets show that OT-ALD improves sampling efficiency by 20.29% and reduces the FID score by 2.6 on average compared to the top-performing baseline models.", "AI": {"tldr": "DDIB\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002OT-ALD\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u6700\u4f18\u8f93\u8fd0\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "DDIB\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ece\u6e90\u57df\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u7684OT\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6620\u5c04\u540e\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e2d\u53cd\u5411\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8d77\u70b9\u3002", "result": "OT-ALD\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5931\u914d\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u738720.29%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747FID\u5206\u6570\u964d\u4f4e\u4e862.6\u3002", "conclusion": "OT-ALD\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

While it performs strongly on zero-shot and few-shot tasks, its robustness to linguistic variation, particularly paraphrasing, remains underexplored. Paraphrase robustness is essential for reliable deployment, especially in socially sensitive contexts where inconsistent representations can amplify demographic biases. In this paper, we introduce the Paraphrase Ranking Stability Metric (PRSM), a novel measure for quantifying CLIP's sensitivity to paraphrased queries. Using the Social Counterfactuals dataset, a benchmark designed to reveal social and demographic biases, we empirically assess CLIP's stability under paraphrastic variation, examine the interaction between paraphrase robustness and gender, and discuss implications for fairness and equitable deployment of multimodal systems.

Despite great efforts, it remains challenging to explicitly learn and predict latencies, the temporal delays with which agents respond to different trajectory-changing events and adjust their future paths, whether on their own or interactively. Different agents may exhibit distinct latency preferences for noticing, processing, and reacting to any specific trajectory-changing event. The lack of consideration of such latencies may undermine the causal continuity of the forecasting system and also lead to implausible or unintended trajectories. Inspired by the reverberation curves in acoustics, we propose a new reverberation transform and the corresponding Reverberation (short for Rev) trajectory prediction model, which simulates and predicts different latency preferences of each agent as well as their stochasticity by using two explicit and learnable reverberation kernels, allowing for the controllable trajectory prediction based on these forecasted latencies. Experiments on multiple datasets, whether pedestrians or vehicles, demonstrate that Rev achieves competitive accuracy while revealing interpretable latency dynamics across agents and scenarios.

Results from a pilot annotation study demonstrate that these categories provide broad coverage of adverbs in natural text and can be reliably assigned by human annotators. Incorporating this typology extends WordNet's coverage, aligns it more closely with linguistic theory, and facilitates downstream NLP applications such as word sense disambiguation, event extraction, sentiment analysis, and discourse modeling.

While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in individual astrodynamics tasks, existing approaches often require separate policies for distinct mission phases, limiting adaptability and increasing operational complexity. This work introduces a transformer-based RL framework that unifies multi-phase trajectory optimization through a single policy architecture, leveraging the transformer's inherent capacity to model extended temporal contexts. Building on proximal policy optimization (PPO), our framework replaces conventional recurrent networks with a transformer encoder-decoder structure, enabling the agent to maintain coherent memory across mission phases spanning seconds to minutes during critical operations. By integrating a Gated Transformer-XL (GTrXL) architecture, the framework eliminates manual phase transitions while maintaining stability in control decisions. We validate our approach progressively: first demonstrating near-optimal performance on single-phase benchmarks (double integrator and Van der Pol oscillator), then extending to multiphase waypoint navigation variants, and finally tackling a complex multiphase rocket ascent problem that includes atmospheric flight, stage separation, and vacuum operations. Results demonstrate that the transformer-based framework not only matches analytical solutions in simple cases but also effectively learns coherent control policies across dynamically distinct regimes, establishing a foundation for scalable autonomous mission planning that reduces reliance on phase-specific controllers while maintaining compatibility with safety-critical verification protocols.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e Transformer \u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u822a\u5929\u5668\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u9636\u6bb5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u72ec\u7acb\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u822a\u5929\u5668\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8fd9\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5e76\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u7528 Transformer \u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7ed3\u6784\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86 Gated Transformer-XL (GTrXL) \u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u5305\u62ec\u53d1\u5c04\u3001\u4e0a\u5347\u3001\u7ea7\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u8f68\u9053\u63d2\u5165\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u9636\u6bb5\u4e2d\u7ef4\u6301\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u63a7\u5236\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u5207\u6362\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u53cc\u79ef\u5206\u5668\u548c Van der Pol \u632f\u5b50\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u822a\u70b9\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u706b\u7bad\u4e0a\u5347\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u5b66\u4e60\u4e86\u8de8\u8d8a\u5927\u6c14\u5c42\u98de\u884c\u3001\u7ea7\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u771f\u7a7a\u4f5c\u4e1a\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e Transformer \u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u8de8\u8d8a\u52a8\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u9636\u6bb5\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002"}}

The lack of specificity is a significant research gap, as identifying the type of anomaly (e.g., \"Crack\" vs. \"Scratch\") is crucial for accurate diagnosis that facilitates cost-saving operational decisions across diverse application domains. While some recent large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have begun to address this, they are computationally intensive and memory-heavy, restricting their use in real-time or embedded systems. We propose MultiTypeFCDD, a simple and lightweight convolutional framework designed as a practical alternative for explainable multi-type anomaly detection. MultiTypeFCDD uses only image-level labels to learn and produce multi-channel heatmaps, where each channel is trained to correspond to a specific anomaly type. The model functions as a single, unified framework capable of differentiating anomaly types across multiple object categories, eliminating the need to train and manage separate models for each object category.

We propose a novel adversarial training strategy, called LANE, to address this limitation by deliberately shifting the model's learning focus to the target word. This method generates challenging negative training examples through the selective marking of alternate words in the training set. The goal is to force the model to create a greater separability between same sentences with different marked words. Experimental results on lexical semantic change detection and word sense disambiguation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach yields more discriminative word representations, improving performance over standard contrastive learning baselines. We further provide qualitative analyses showing that the proposed negatives lead to representations that better capture subtle meaning differences even in challenging environments.

If the predictor is the Bayes optimal one, then computing the best matching based on the predicted weights is optimal. However, in practice, this perfect information scenario is not realistic. Given an imperfect predictor, a suboptimal decision rule may compensate for the induced error and thus outperform the standard optimal rule.\n  In this paper, we propose multicalibration as a way to address this problem. This fairness notion requires a predictor to be unbiased on each element of a family of protected sets of contexts. Given a class of matching algorithms $\\mathcal C$ and any predictor $\u03b3$ of the edge-weights, we show how to construct a specific multicalibrated predictor $\\hat \u03b3$, with the following property. Picking the best matching based on the output of $\\hat \u03b3$ is competitive with the best decision rule in $\\mathcal C$ applied onto the original predictor $\u03b3$.

Meanwhile, data serves as the fundamental infrastructure for modern autonomous driving AI. However, due to stringent data collection requirements, existing datasets focus primarily on ordinary traffic scenarios, constraining the benefits of cooperative perception. To address this challenge, we introduce CATS-V2V, the first-of-its-kind real-world dataset for V2V cooperative perception under complex adverse traffic scenarios. The dataset was collected by two hardware time-synchronized vehicles, covering 10 weather and lighting conditions across 10 diverse locations. The 100-clip dataset includes 60K frames of 10 Hz LiDAR point clouds and 1.26M multi-view 30 Hz camera images, along with 750K anonymized yet high-precision RTK-fixed GNSS and IMU records. Correspondingly, we provide time-consistent 3D bounding box annotations for objects, as well as static scenes to construct a 4D BEV representation. On this basis, we propose a target-based temporal alignment method, ensuring that all objects are precisely aligned across all sensor modalities. We hope that CATS-V2V, the largest-scale, most supportive, and highest-quality dataset of its kind to date, will benefit the autonomous driving community in related tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CATS-V2V\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6076\u52a3\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5bf9\u8f66\u8f66\u534f\u540c\u611f\u77e5\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u8986\u76d6\u590d\u6742\u6076\u52a3\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8f66\u8f66\u534f\u540c\u611f\u77e5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u652f\u6301\u8f66\u8f66\u534f\u540c\u611f\u77e5\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c6\u4e86\u5305\u542b10\u79cd\u5929\u6c14\u548c\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u8de8\u8d8a10\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u70b9\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u7531\u4e24\u53f0\u786c\u4ef6\u65f6\u95f4\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u6536\u96c6\u3002\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542bLiDAR\u70b9\u4e91\u3001\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u76f8\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u3001GNSS\u548cIMU\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e863D\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u548c\u9759\u6001\u573a\u666f\u76844D BEV\u8868\u793a\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u8fc4\u4eca\u4e3a\u6b62\u6700\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u6700\u5177\u652f\u6301\u6027\u3001\u6700\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8f66\u8f66\u534f\u540c\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08CATS-V2V\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b60K\u5e27LiDAR\u70b9\u4e91\u30011.26M\u5e27\u76f8\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u548c750K\u6761GNSS/IMU\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u76843D\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u548c4D BEV\u8868\u793a\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "conclusion": "CATS-V2V\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u63a8\u51fa\u5c06\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u793e\u533a\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6076\u52a3\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u529b\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8f66\u8f66\u534f\u540c\u611f\u77e5\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches often struggle with scalability, linguistic quality, and factual consistency. This paper presents a scalable and deterministic pipeline for generating natural language QA from KGs, with an additional refinement step using LLMs to further enhance linguistic quality. The approach first clusters KG triplets based on their relations, creating reusable templates through natural language rules derived from the entity types of objects and relations.

First, we show that JAX-FEM's automatic differentiation (AD) enables direct gradient-based estimation of complex boundary admittance from sparse pressure measurements, achieving 3-digit precision without requiring manual derivation of adjoint equations. Second, we apply randomized finite differences to acoustic shape optimization, combining JAX-FEM for forward simulation with PyTorch3D for mesh manipulation through AD. By separating physics-driven boundary optimization from geometry-driven interior mesh adaptation, we achieve 48.1% energy reduction at target frequencies with 30-fold fewer FEM solutions compared to standard finite difference on the full mesh.

Accepted to Special Track on AI Alignment, AAAI 2026. Project Page- https://refine-align.github.io/", "summary": "In the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Agentic AI, calibration refers to how closely an AI system's confidence in its answers reflects their actual correctness. This aspect becomes especially important when such systems operate autonomously and must make decisions under visual uncertainty. While modern VQA systems, powered by advanced vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used in high-stakes domains like medical diagnostics and autonomous navigation due to their improved accuracy, the reliability of their confidence estimates remains under-examined. Particularly, these systems often produce overconfident responses. To address this, we introduce AlignVQA, a debate-based multi-agent framework, in which diverse specialized VLM -- each following distinct prompting strategies -- generate candidate answers and then engage in two-stage interaction: generalist agents critique, refine and aggregate these proposals. This debate process yields confidence estimates that more accurately reflect the model's true predictive performance. We find that more calibrated specialized agents produce better aligned confidences. Furthermore, we introduce a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss function called aligncal designed to fine-tune the specialized agents by minimizing an upper bound on the calibration error.

While recent advances such as 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in dynamic scene reconstruction, they typically rely on the assumption that input video streams are temporally synchronized. However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption often fails due to factors like camera trigger delays or independent recording setups, leading to temporal misalignment across views and reduced reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, a novel temporal alignment strategy is proposed for high-quality 4DGS reconstruction from unsynchronized multi-view videos. Our method features a coarse-to-fine alignment module that estimates and compensates for each camera's time shift. The method first determines a coarse, frame-level offset and then refines it to achieve sub-frame accuracy. This strategy can be integrated as a readily integrable module into existing 4DGS frameworks, enhancing their robustness when handling asynchronous data. Experiments show that our approach effectively processes temporally misaligned videos and significantly enhances baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u6b65\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf4D\u9ad8\u65af\u55b7\u6d82\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u7531\u4e8e\u76f8\u673a\u89e6\u53d1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6216\u72ec\u7acb\u5f55\u5236\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65f6\u95f4\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u6b65\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u5230\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9996\u5148\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e76\u8865\u507f\u6bcf\u4e2a\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u65f6\u79fb\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u9010\u5e27\u7684\u7c97\u7565\u504f\u79fb\u91cf\u786e\u5b9a\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u4e9a\u5e27\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u7ec6\u5316\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u73b0\u67094D\u9ad8\u65af\u55b7\u6d82\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u9519\u4f4d\u7684\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4ee5\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u67094D\u9ad8\u65af\u55b7\u6d82\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6b65\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u9519\u4f4d\u7684\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, recent research has shown that machine learning models may be vulnerable in a number of ways, putting both the models and the systems theyre used in at risk. In this paper, we intend to analyze and experiment with the best of existing adversarial attack recipes and create new ones. We concentrated on developing a novel adversarial attack strategy on current state-of-the-art machine learning models by producing ambiguous inputs for the models to confound them and then constructing the path to the future development of the robustness of the models.

While continual learning (CL) offers a promising paradigm to maintain model effectiveness, many approaches rely on full retraining or data replay, which are infeasible in data-sensitive environments. Moreover, existing methods remain inadequate for security-critical scenarios, facing two coupled challenges in knowledge transfer: preserving prior knowledge without old data and integrating new knowledge with minimal interference.\n  We propose RETROFIT, a data retrospective-free continual learning method that achieves bounded forgetting for effective knowledge transfer. Our key idea is to consolidate previously trained and newly fine-tuned models, serving as teachers of old and new knowledge, through parameter-level merging that eliminates the need for historical data. To mitigate interference, we apply low-rank and sparse updates that confine parameter changes to independent subspaces, while a knowledge arbitration dynamically balances the teacher contributions guided by model confidence. Our evaluation on two representative applications demonstrates that RETROFIT consistently mitigates forgetting while maintaining adaptability. In malware detection under temporal drift, it substantially improves the retention score, from 20.2% to 38.6% over CL baselines, and exceeds the oracle upper bound on new data. In binary summarization across decompilation levels, where analyzing stripped binaries is especially challenging, RETROFIT achieves around twice the BLEU score of transfer learning used in prior work and surpasses all baselines in cross-representation generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "RETROFIT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u8fdb\u884c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5408\u5e76\u548c\u4f4e\u79e9\u7a00\u758f\u66f4\u65b0\u6765\u4fdd\u7559\u65e7\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u65b0\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u8870\u9000\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5a01\u80c1\u4e0d\u65ad\u6f14\u53d8\u548c\u6570\u636e\u8868\u793a\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4f1a\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CL\uff09\u867d\u7136\u6709\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u653e\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u6570\u636e\u654f\u611f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u65e7\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4fdd\u7559\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u6574\u5408\u65b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "RETROFIT\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee5\u4e0b\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\uff1a1. \u53c2\u6570\u7ea7\u5408\u5e76\uff1a\u6574\u5408\u5148\u524d\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u65b0\u8fd1\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u201c\u6559\u5e08\u201d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e7\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u65b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u30022. \u4f4e\u79e9\u7a00\u758f\u66f4\u65b0\uff1a\u9650\u5236\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u5728\u72ec\u7acb\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5e72\u6270\u30023. \u77e5\u8bc6\u4ef2\u88c1\uff1a\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u6559\u5e08\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u4ee5\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e3a\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6458\u8981\u4e24\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0cRETROFIT\u5747\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002\u5728\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5176\u4fdd\u7559\u7387\u4ece20.2%\u63d0\u9ad8\u523038.6%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eCL\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u7684Oracle\u4e0a\u9650\u3002\u5728\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cRETROFIT\u7684BLEU\u5206\u6570\u662f\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u4e24\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u8de8\u8868\u793a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "RETROFIT\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u9700\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u3001\u6709\u6548\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6458\u8981\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Most existing methods rely on Transformer-based cross-attention, whose quadratic complexity hinders efficiency. Moreover, small vision-language models often struggle to precisely capture fine-grained, task-relevant visual regions, leading to degraded performance on fine-grained reasoning tasks that limit their effectiveness in the real world. To address these issues, we introduce Viper-F1, a Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model that replaces attention with efficient Liquid State-Space Dynamics. To further enhance visual grounding, we propose a Token-Grid Correlation Module, which computes lightweight correlations between text tokens and image patches and modulates the state-space dynamics via FiLM conditioning.

Large language models (LLMs) like BloombergGPT and FinMA have set new benchmarks across various financial NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, stock movement prediction, and credit risk assessment. Furthermore, FinMA-ES, a bilingual financial LLM, has also demonstrated strong performance using the FLARE and FLARE-ES benchmarks. However, the high computational demands of these models limit the accessibility of many organizations. To address this, we propose Layer-wise Adaptive Ensemble Tuning (LAET), a novel strategy that selectively fine-tunes the most effective layers of pre-trained LLMs by analyzing hidden state representations while freezing less critical layers. LAET significantly reduces computational overhead while enhancing task-specific performance. Our approach shows strong results in financial NLP tasks, outperforming existing benchmarks and state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4, even with smaller LLMs ($\\sim$3B parameters).

Quantitative evaluation shows NOVA outperforms coding-agent baselines, and a pathologist-verified case study links morphology to prognostically relevant PAM50 subtypes, demonstrating its scalable discovery potential.", "AI": {"tldr": "NOVA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u79d1\u5b66\u67e5\u8be2\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u5206\u6790\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8fd0\u884cPython\u4ee3\u7801\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u96c6\u6210\u4e8649\u79cd\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5728\u9700\u8981\u65f6\u521b\u5efa\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b64\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SlideQuest\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b90\u4e2a\u7531\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u548c\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u3001\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u3002\u4e0e\u4fa7\u91cd\u77e5\u8bc6\u56de\u5fc6\u6216\u8bca\u65ad\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cSlideQuest\u8981\u6c42\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cNOVA\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u7531\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c06\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u4e0e\u9884\u540e\u76f8\u5173\u7684PAM50\u4e9a\u578b\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u75c5\u7406\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u590d\u6742\u3001\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aNOVA\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u79d1\u5b66\u67e5\u8be2\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002\u5176\u5de5\u4f5c\u65b9\u5f0f\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5730\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8fd0\u884cPython\u4ee3\u7801\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u3002NOVA\u96c6\u6210\u4e8649\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u7ec6\u80de\u6838\u5206\u5272\u3001\u5168\u5207\u7247\u7f16\u7801\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd8\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u9700\u8981\u5373\u65f6\u521b\u5efa\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b64\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aSlideQuest\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8be5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5305\u542b90\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u548c\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u3001\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cNOVA\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u7531\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5177\u6709\u9884\u540e\u610f\u4e49\u7684PAM50\u4e9a\u578b\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "NOVA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u7b80\u5316\u75c5\u7406\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u80fd\u529b\u3002SlideQuest\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u63d0\u51fa\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b64\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

However, the lack of transparency has raised concerns about whether these data-informed AI software decisions secure fairness against people of all racial, gender, or age groups. Despite extensive research on emerging fairness-aware AI software, up to now most efforts to solve this issue have been dedicated to binary classification tasks. Fairness in regression is relatively underexplored. In this work, we adopted a mutual information-based metric to assess separation violations. The metric is also extended so that it can be directly applied to both classification and regression problems with both binary and continuous sensitive attributes. Inspired by the Reweighing algorithm in fair classification, we proposed a FairReweighing pre-processing algorithm based on density estimation to ensure that the learned model satisfies the separation criterion. Theoretically, we show that the proposed FairReweighing algorithm can guarantee separation in the training data under a data independence assumption. Empirically, on both synthetic and real-world data, we show that FairReweighing outperforms existing state-of-the-art regression fairness solutions in terms of improving separation while maintaining high accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFairReweighing\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3AI\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u56de\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u79bb\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u516c\u5171\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u5c1a\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u79bb\u5ea6\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u56de\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u53d7Reweighing\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684FairReweighing\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6ee1\u8db3\u5206\u79bb\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "result": "FairReweighing\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u79bb\u5ea6\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u56de\u5f52\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "FairReweighing\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002"}}

A single SEVIRI infrared channel (10.8 \u03bcm wavelength) is used as input, which consists of four observations over a one-hour period. A two-stage training strategy is applied to generate rainfall estimates up to four hours ahead. In the first stage, ConvGRU is trained to forecast the brightness temperatures from SEVIRI, enabling the model to capture relevant spatiotemporal patterns. In the second stage, an empirically derived nonlinear transformation maps the predicted fields to OPERA-compatible rainfall rates.\n  For the event-prediction task, the transformed rainfall forecasts are processed using 3D event detection followed by spatiotemporal feature extraction to identify and characterize precipitation events.

Our data construction pipeline integrates expert human curation with automated agent-assisted verification, ensuring linguistic accuracy, cultural relevance, and educational value. Benchmarking multiple state-of-the-art LLMs on LaoBench reveals that current models still face significant challenges in mastering Lao across diverse tasks. We hope LaoBench will catalyze further research and development of AI technologies for underrepresented Southeast Asian languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\u5728\u8001\u631d\u8bed\u7b49\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6ede\u540e\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LaoBench\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8001\u631d\u8bed\u4e0a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u672a\u80fd\u5339\u914d\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u8001\u631d\u8bed\u7b49\u4e1c\u5357\u4e9a\u8bed\u8a00\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u8861\u91cfLLM\u5728\u8001\u631d\u8bed\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b17,000\u591a\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u7684LaoBench\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e94\u7528\u3001K12\u57fa\u7840\u6559\u80b2\u3001\u8001\u631d\u8bed\u4e0e\u4e2d\u6587\u3001\u82f1\u6587\u7684\u53cc\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5206\u4e3a\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u95ed\u6e90\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u95ed\u6e90\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5b98\u65b9\u5e73\u53f0\u8fdb\u884c\u9ed1\u76d2\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u6d41\u7a0b\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e13\u5bb6\u4eba\u5de5\u7b56\u5212\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u8f85\u52a9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728LaoBench\u4e0a\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdbLLM\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u638c\u63e1\u8001\u631d\u8bed\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u4e25\u5cfb\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "LaoBench\u7684\u63a8\u51fa\u65e8\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u5bf9\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u4e1c\u5357\u4e9a\u8bed\u8a00\u7684AI\u6280\u672f\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

We revisit this belief by decomposing the expected multi-step forecast error into three parts: irreducible noise, a structural approximation gap, and an estimation-variance term. For linear predictors we show that the structural gap is identically zero for any dataset. For nonlinear predictors, however, the repeated composition used in recursion can increase model expressivity, making the structural gap depend on both the model and the data. We further show that the estimation variance of the recursive strategy at any horizon can be written as the one-step variance multiplied by a Jacobian-based amplification factor that measures how sensitive the composed predictor is to parameter error. This perspective explains when recursive forecasting may simultaneously have lower bias and higher variance than direct forecasting. Experiments with multilayer perceptrons on the ETTm1 dataset confirm these findings. The results offer practical guidance for choosing between recursive and direct strategies based on model nonlinearity and noise characteristics, rather than relying on traditional bias-variance intuition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9012\u5f52\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u53ef\u4ee5\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\u3002\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u4e2d\u7ed3\u6784\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a\u96f6\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u4e2d\u9012\u5f52\u7ec4\u5408\u53ef\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u8bef\u5dee\u3002\u9012\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u7684\u653e\u5927\u56e0\u5b50\u6765\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u8be5\u56e0\u5b50\u8861\u91cf\u4e86\u7ec4\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8e\u9012\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u9ad8\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\uff09\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u4f4e\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\uff09\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6cd5\u5219\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u591a\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff1a\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\u3002\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u9012\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u9884\u6d4b\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u7684\u653e\u5927\u56e0\u5b50\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u8bef\u5dee\u6052\u4e3a\u96f6\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u9012\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u6784\u8bef\u5dee\u3002\u9012\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\u4f1a\u968f\u7740\u9884\u6d4b\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0e\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u653e\u5927\u56e0\u5b50\u6709\u5173\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u9012\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9009\u62e9\u9012\u5f52\u8fd8\u662f\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u5e94\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u6027\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

We propose a VQA framework that integrates CoT reasoning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve interpretability, robustness, and accuracy. By generating intermediate rationales, the model better handles tasks involving detection, classification, spatial relations, and comparative analysis, which are critical for reliable decision support in high stakes climate domains. Experiments show that CoT supervision improves accuracy by 34.9\\% over direct baselines, while DPO yields additional gains in accuracy and reasoning quality.

In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Domain Detection of AI-Generated Text (M-DAIGT) shared task, which focuses on detecting AI-generated text across multiple domains, particularly in news articles and academic writing. M-DAIGT comprises two binary classification subtasks: News Article Detection (NAD) (Subtask 1) and Academic Writing Detection (AWD) (Subtask 2). To support this task, we developed and released a new large-scale benchmark dataset of 30,000 samples, balanced between human-written and AI-generated texts.

We formulate MoCap-to-spectrogram translation as a windowed sequence-to-sequence task using a transformer-based model that jointly captures spatial relations among MoCap markers and temporal dynamics across frames. Real-world experiments show that the proposed approach produces visually and quantitatively plausible doppler radar spectrograms and achieves good generalizability. Ablation experiments show that the learned model includes both the ability to convert multi-part motion into doppler signatures and an understanding of the spatial relations between different parts of the human body.\n  The result is an interesting example of using transformers for time-series signal processing. It is especially applicable to edge computing and Internet of Things (IoT) radars. It also suggests the ability to augment scarce radar datasets using more abundant MoCap data for training higher-level applications. Finally, it requires far less computation than physics-based methods for generating radar data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7eaf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u52a8\u4f5c\u6355\u6349(MoCap)\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u4e3a\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u96f7\u8fbe\u9891\u8c31\u56fe\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u96f7\u8fbe\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6269\u5145\u96f7\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u96f7\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u5229\u7528\u66f4\u6613\u83b7\u53d6\u7684MoCap\u6570\u636e\u6765\u751f\u6210\u96f7\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5c06MoCap\u5230\u9891\u8c31\u56fe\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e26\u7a97\u53e3\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u5230\u5e8f\u5217\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349MoCap\u6807\u8bb0\u7269\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u8de8\u5e27\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u96f7\u8fbe\u9891\u8c31\u56fe\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u4e0a\u90fd\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u826f\u597d\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u90e8\u5206\u8fd0\u52a8\u5230\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u7b7e\u540d\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u4ee5\u53ca\u4eba\u4f53\u4e0d\u540c\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5229\u7528Transformer\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6709\u8da3\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u96f7\u8fbe\u3002\u5b83\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684MoCap\u6570\u636e\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u96f7\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5c42\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u3002\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u96f7\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u6240\u9700\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\u5927\u51cf\u5c11\u3002"}}

We present the first large-scale, systematic study of VLM robustness to benign visual and textual perturbations: pixel-level shifts, light geometric transformations, padded rescaling, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites that do not alter the underlying semantics of an image-question pair. Across a broad set of models and datasets, we find that modern VLMs are highly sensitive to such minor perturbations: a substantial fraction of samples change their predicted answer under at least one visual or textual modification. We characterize how this instability varies across perturbation types, question categories, and models, revealing that even state-of-the-art systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) frequently fail under shifts as small as a few pixels or harmless rephrasings. We further show that sample-level stability serves as a strong indicator of correctness: stable samples are consistently far more likely to be answered correctly. Leveraging this, we demonstrate that the stability patterns of small, accessible open-source models can be used to predict the correctness of much larger closed-source models with high precision. Our findings expose a fundamental fragility in current VLMs and highlight the need for robustness evaluations that go beyond adversarial perturbations, focusing instead on invariances that models should reliably uphold.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u5fae\u5c0f\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6270\u52a8\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u6837\u672c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u5c0f\u578b\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u5fae\u5c0f\u8f93\u5165\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u63a2\u7a76VLM\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u4e86VLM\u5bf9\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u79fb\u4f4d\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\u3001\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\u3001\u91ca\u4e49\u548c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6539\u5199\u7b49\u826f\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8fd8\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u5927\u578b\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41VLM\uff08\u5305\u62ecGPT-4o\u548cGemini 2.0 Flash\uff09\u5bf9\u5fae\u5c0f\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\uff08\u5982\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u79fb\u4f4d\uff09\u548c\u6587\u672c\uff08\u5982\u91ca\u4e49\uff09\u6270\u52a8\u975e\u5e38\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u76f8\u5f53\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u6837\u672c\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7b54\u6848\u53d1\u751f\u6539\u53d8\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u6709\u529b\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6837\u672c\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u6b63\u786e\u56de\u7b54\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5c0f\u578b\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u5927\u578b\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dVLM\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684VLM\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Beyond the coverage guarantee, adaptiveness to example difficulty is an important property. It means that the method should produce larger prediction sets for more difficult examples, and smaller ones for easier examples. Existing evaluation methods for adaptiveness typically analyze coverage rate violation or average set size across bins of examples grouped by difficulty. However, these approaches often suffer from imbalanced binning, which can lead to inaccurate estimates of coverage or set size. To address this issue, we propose a binning method that leverages input transformations to sort examples by difficulty, followed by uniform-mass binning. Building on this binning, we introduce two metrics to better evaluate adaptiveness. These metrics provide more reliable estimates of coverage rate violation and average set size due to balanced binning, leading to more accurate adaptivity assessment. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed metric correlates more strongly with the desired adaptiveness property compared to existing ones. Furthermore, motivated by our findings, we propose a new adaptive prediction set algorithm that groups examples by estimated difficulty and applies group-conditional conformal prediction. This allows us to determine appropriate thresholds for each group. Experimental results on both (a) an Image Classification (ImageNet) (b) a medical task (visual acuity prediction) show that our method outperforms existing approaches according to the new metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u7387\u8986\u76d6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e5f\u5e94\u5177\u5907\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u96be\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5206\u7bb1\u4e0d\u5747\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u5747\u5300\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u7bb1\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u6765\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u671f\u671b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u6839\u636e\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7ec4\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5404\u7ec4\u5e94\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u89c6\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8861\u91cf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u96be\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u5206\u7bb1\u4e0d\u5747\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u7bb1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9996\u5148\u5229\u7528\u8f93\u5165\u53d8\u6362\u5bf9\u6837\u672c\u6309\u96be\u5ea6\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u5747\u5300\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u7bb1\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u6839\u636e\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7ec4\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5404\u7ec4\u5e94\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u671f\u671b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\uff08ImageNet\uff09\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u89c6\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u4e0a\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u6570\u636e\u5206\u7bb1\u548c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u96be\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing backdoor attacks for 3D point clouds have been limited to a rigid one-to-one paradigm. To address this, we present the first one-to-N backdoor framework for 3D vision, based on a novel, configurable spherical trigger. Our key insight is to leverage the spatial properties of spheres as a parameter space, allowing a single trigger design to encode multiple target classes. We establish a theoretical foundation for one-to-N backdoor attacks in 3D, demonstrating that poisoned models can map distinct trigger configurations to different target labels. Experimental results systematically validate this conclusion across multiple datasets and model architectures, achieving high attack success rates (up to 100\\%) while maintaining accuracy on clean data.

However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Instead of building separate models, we propose MAFM^3 (Modular Adaptation of Foundation Models for Multi-Modal Medical AI), a framework that enables a single foundation model to expand into diverse domains, tasks, and modalities through lightweight modular components. These components serve as specialized skill sets that allow the system to flexibly activate the appropriate capability at the inference time, depending on the input type or clinical objective. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat each new task or modality in isolation, MAFM^3 provides a unified and expandable framework for efficient multitask and multimodality adaptation. Empirically, we validate our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for classification into prognosis and segmentation modules. Our results show improved performance on both tasks. Furthermore, by incorporating PET scans, MAFM^3 achieved an improvement in the Dice score 5% compared to the respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models, when equipped with modular components, are not inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve into multitask, multimodality systems for medical imaging.

Our system operates on egocentric binaural audio and uses the wearer's self-speech as an anchor, leveraging turn-taking behavior and dialogue dynamics to infer conversational partners and suppress others. To enable real-time, on-device operation, we propose a dual-model architecture: a lightweight streaming model runs every 12.5 ms for low-latency extraction of the conversation partners, while a slower model runs less frequently to capture longer-range conversational dynamics. Results on real-world 2- and 3-speaker conversation test sets, collected with binaural egocentric hardware from 11 participants totaling 6.8 hours, show generalization in identifying and isolating conversational partners in multi-conversation settings.

We examine how the iD estimates vary as a function of Bayesian neural network (BNN) energy scores, which measure how similar the radio sources are to the MiraBest subset of the RGZ dataset. We find that out-of-distribution sources exhibit higher iD values, and that the overall iD for RGZ exceeds those typically reported for natural image datasets.

However, when the input comprises sparse training views, 3DGS is prone to overfitting, primarily due to the lack of intermediate-view supervision. Inspired by the recent success of Video Diffusion Models (VDM), we propose a framework called Guidance Score Distillation (GSD) to extract the rich multi-view consistency priors from pretrained VDMs. Building on the insights from Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), GSD supervises rendered images from multiple neighboring views, guiding the Gaussian splatting representation towards the generative direction of VDM. However, the generative direction often involves object motion and random camera trajectories, making it challenging for direct supervision in the optimization process. To address this problem, we introduce an unified guidance form to correct the noise prediction result of VDM. Specifically, we incorporate both a depth warp guidance based on real depth maps and a guidance based on semantic image features, ensuring that the score update direction from VDM aligns with the correct camera pose and accurate geometry.

Training-time alignment methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) face prohibitive costs in expert supervision and inherent scalability limitations, offering limited dynamic control during inference. Consequently, there is an urgent need for scalable and adaptable alignment mechanisms. To address this, we propose W2S-AlignTree, a pioneering plug-and-play inference-time alignment framework that synergistically combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with the Weak-to-Strong Generalization paradigm for the first time. W2S-AlignTree formulates LLM alignment as an optimal heuristic search problem within a generative search tree. By leveraging weak model's real-time, step-level signals as alignment proxies and introducing an Entropy-Aware exploration mechanism, W2S-AlignTree enables fine-grained guidance during strong model's generation without modifying its parameters. The approach dynamically balances exploration and exploitation in high-dimensional generation search trees. Experiments across controlled sentiment generation, summarization, and instruction-following show that W2S-AlignTree consistently outperforms strong baselines.

Despite achieving impressive accuracy on benchmarks, these models produce confident hallucinations, even when wrong answers carry catastrophic consequences. Our evaluations on GSM8K, MedQA and GPQA show frontier models almost never abstain despite explicit warnings of severe penalties, suggesting that prompts cannot override training that rewards any answer over no answer. As a remedy, we propose Reinforced Hesitation (RH): a modification to Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to use ternary rewards (+1 correct, 0 abstention, -$\u03bb$ error) instead of binary. Controlled experiments on logic puzzles reveal that varying $\u03bb$ produces distinct models along a Pareto frontier, where each training penalty yields the optimal model for its corresponding risk regime: low penalties produce aggressive answerers, high penalties conservative abstainers. We then introduce two inference strategies that exploit trained abstention as a coordination signal: cascading routes queries through models with decreasing risk tolerance, while self-cascading re-queries the same model on abstention. Both outperform majority voting with lower computational cost. These results establish abstention as a first-class training objective that transforms ``I don't know'' from failure into a coordination signal, enabling models to earn trust through calibrated honesty about their limits.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

While recent research has extensively examined positional bias in text generation models, its presence and effects in representation models remain underexplored. Even less is known about such biases in multimodal models. In this work, we investigate positional bias in multimodal representation models, specifically in the context of image-text retrieval. We begin by distinguishing between context importance and positional bias, and then assess the presence and extent of positional bias across different models and datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that positional bias is prevalent in multimodal models, but manifests differently across modalities: text encoders tend to exhibit bias toward the beginning of the input, whereas image encoders show bias at both the beginning and end. Furthermore, we find that this bias arises from, or is amplified by, a combination of factors, including the positional encoding scheme, training loss, context importance, and the nature of using image-text pairs in multimodal training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u504f\u5411\u8f93\u5165\u5f00\u5934\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u504f\u5411\u5f00\u5934\u548c\u7ed3\u5c3e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5bf9\u8868\u793a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u89c1\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u533a\u5206\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u548c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u504f\u5411\u8f93\u5165\u5f00\u5934\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u504f\u5411\u8f93\u5165\u5f00\u5934\u548c\u7ed3\u5c3e\u3002\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u89c1\u53d7\u5230\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u56fe\u6587\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u5f0f\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u6216\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u8be5\u504f\u89c1\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4e14\u53d7\u591a\u79cd\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

To address this, we introduce Professional Reasoning Bench (PRBench), a realistic, open-ended, and difficult benchmark of real-world problems in Finance and Law. We open-source its 1,100 expert-authored tasks and 19,356 expert-curated criteria, making it, to our knowledge, the largest public, rubric-based benchmark for both legal and finance domains. We recruit 182 qualified professionals, holding JDs, CFAs, or 6+ years of experience, who contributed tasks inspired by their actual workflows. This process yields significant diversity, with tasks spanning 114 countries and 47 US jurisdictions. Our expert-curated rubrics are validated through a rigorous quality pipeline, including independent expert validation. Subsequent evaluation of 20 leading models reveals substantial room for improvement, with top scores of only 0.39 (Finance) and 0.37 (Legal) on our Hard subsets. We further catalog associated economic impacts of the prompts and analyze performance using human-annotated rubric categories. Our analysis shows that models with similar overall scores can diverge significantly on specific capabilities.

In this paper, we propose DiT-Gaze, a framework that enhances 3D gaze redirection models using a novel combination of Diffusion Transformer (DiT), weak supervision across gaze angles, and an orthogonality constraint loss. DiT allows higher-fidelity image synthesis, while our weak supervision strategy using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles provides a smooth manifold of gaze directions during training. The orthogonality constraint loss mathematically enforces the disentanglement of internal representations for gaze, head pose, and expression. Comprehensive experiments show that DiT-Gaze sets a new state-of-the-art in both perceptual quality and redirection accuracy, reducing the state-of-the-art gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees, providing a superior method for creating synthetic training data.

As a result, there is a growing need to enhance the fairness of clustering outcomes, ideally by making minimal modifications, possibly as a post-processing step after conventional clustering. Recently, Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25] initiated the study of \\emph{closest fair clustering}, though in a restricted scenario where data points belong to only two groups. In practice, however, data points are typically characterized by many groups, reflecting diverse protected attributes such as age, ethnicity, gender, etc.\n  In this work, we generalize the study of the \\emph{closest fair clustering} problem to settings with an arbitrary number (more than two) of groups. We begin by showing that the problem is NP-hard even when all groups are of equal size -- a stark contrast with the two-group case, for which an exact algorithm exists. Next, we propose near-linear time approximation algorithms that efficiently handle arbitrary-sized multiple groups, thereby answering an open question posed by Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25].\n  Leveraging our closest fair clustering algorithms, we further achieve improved approximation guarantees for the \\emph{fair correlation clustering} problem, advancing the state-of-the-art results established by Ahmadian et al. [AISTATS'20] and Ahmadi et al. [2020].

Most existing approaches focus exclusively on either domain-aware or domain-general features, overlooking the potential synergy between them. To address this, we propose DoReMi (Domain-Representation Mixture), a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that jointly models Domain-aware Experts branch and a unified Representation branch to enable cooperative learning between specialized and generalizable knowledge. DoReMi dynamically activates domain-aware expert branch via Domain-Guided Spatial Routing (DSR) for context-aware expert selection and employs Entropy-Controlled Dynamic Allocation (EDA) for stable and efficient expert utilization, thereby adaptively modeling diverse domain distributions. Complemented by a frozen unified representation branch pretrained through robust multi-attribute self-supervised learning, DoReMi preserves cross-domain geometric and structural priors while maintaining global consistency. We evaluate DoReMi across multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. Notably, DoReMi achieves 80.1% mIoU on ScanNet Val and 77.2% mIoU on S3DIS, demonstrating competitive or superior performance compared to existing approaches, and showing strong potential as a foundation framework for future 3D understanding research.

However, general image editing models often fail to produce satisfactory results when confronted with new styles. The challenge lies in how to effectively fine-tune general image editing models to new styles using only a limited amount of paired data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel few-shot style editing framework. For this task, we construct a benchmark dataset that encompasses five distinct styles. Correspondingly, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-style Mixture-of-Experts Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE LoRA) with style-specific and style-shared routing mechanisms for jointly fine-tuning multiple styles. The style-specific routing ensures that different styles do not interfere with one another, while the style-shared routing adaptively allocates shared MoE LoRAs to learn common patterns. Our MoE LoRA can automatically determine the optimal ranks for each layer through a novel metric-guided approach that estimates the importance score of each single-rank component. Additionally, we explore the optimal location to insert LoRA within the Diffusion in Transformer (DiT) model and integrate adversarial learning and flow matching to guide the diffusion training process.

This failure stems from a dual-bottleneck: input-stage conflict between computationally exorbitant geometric-aware encoders and superficial 2D-only features, and output-stage misalignment where discrete tokenizers are structurally incapable of producing precise, continuous numerical values. To break this impasse, we introduce GEODE (Geometric-Output and Decoupled-Input Engine), a novel architecture that resolves this dual-bottleneck by decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical generation. GEODE augments main VLM with two specialized, plug-and-play modules: Decoupled Rationale Module (DRM) that acts as spatial co-processor, aligning explicit 3D data with 2D visual features via cross-attention and distilling spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic into injectable Rationale Tokens; and Direct Regression Head (DRH), an \"Embedding-as-Value\" paradigm which routes specialized control tokens to a lightweight MLP for precise, continuous regression of scalars and 3D bounding boxes.

However, the design principles governing MoBA's performance are poorly understood, and it lacks an efficient GPU implementation, hindering its practical adoption. In this paper, we first develop a statistical model to analyze MoBA's underlying mechanics. Our model reveals that performance critically depends on the router's ability to accurately distinguish relevant from irrelevant blocks based on query-key affinities. We derive a signal-to-noise ratio that formally connects architectural parameters to this retrieval accuracy. Guided by our analysis, we identify two key pathways for improvement: using smaller block sizes and applying a short convolution on keys to cluster relevant signals, which enhances routing accuracy. While theoretically better, small block sizes are inefficient on GPUs. To bridge this gap, we introduce FlashMoBA, a hardware-aware CUDA kernel that enables efficient MoBA execution even with the small block sizes our theory recommends. We validate our insights by training LLMs from scratch, showing that our improved MoBA models match the performance of dense attention baselines. FlashMoBA achieves up to 14.7x speedup over FlashAttention-2 for small blocks, making our theoretically-grounded improvements practical.

Along this line, recent \"Mamba-for-vision\" variants largely explore multiple scan orders to relax strict causality for non-sequential signals (e.g., images). Rather than preserving cross-block memory, the conventional formulation of the selective-scan operation in Mamba reinitializes each block's state-space dynamics from zero, discarding the terminal state-space representation (SSR) from the previous block. Arcee, a cross-block recurrent state chain, reuses each block's terminal state-space representation as the initial condition for the next block. Handoff across blocks is constructed as a differentiable boundary map whose Jacobian enables end-to-end gradient flow across terminal boundaries. Key to practicality, Arcee is compatible with all prior \"vision-mamba\" variants, parameter-free, and incurs constant, negligible cost. As a modeling perspective, we view terminal SSR as a mild directional prior induced by a causal pass over the input, rather than an estimator of the non-sequential signal itself. To quantify the impact, for unconditional generation on CelebA-HQ (256$\\times$256) with Flow Matching, Arcee reduces FID$\\downarrow$ from $82.81$ to $15.33$ ($5.4\\times$ lower) on a single scan-order Zigzag Mamba baseline.

This paper introduces a new, real-world AI application for gaze target detection in autistic children, which predicts a child's point of gaze from an activity image. This task is foundational for building automated systems that can measure joint attention-a core challenge in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To facilitate the study of this challenging application, we collected the first-ever Autism Gaze Target (AGT) dataset. We further propose a novel Socially Aware Coarse-to-Fine (SACF) gaze detection framework that explicitly leverages the social context of a scene to overcome the class imbalance common in autism datasets-a consequence of autistic children's tendency to show reduced gaze to faces. It utilizes a two-pathway architecture with expert models specialized in social and non-social gaze, guided by a context-awareness gate module.

This observation suggests that the model already encodes a latent notion of numerical correctness, which can be harnessed to guide generation more precisely. Building on this intuition, we introduce CountSteer, a training-free method that improves generation of specified object counts by steering the model's cross-attention hidden states during inference.

While there has been work trying to acquire this kind of knowledge in the space of vision and language, it has mostly focused on aligning the image patches with the tokens on the language side. However, image patches do not have any meaning to the human eye, and individual tokens do not necessarily carry groundable information in the image. It is groups of tokens which describe different aspects of the scene. In this work, we propose a model which groups the caption tokens as part of its architecture in order to capture a fine-grained representation of the language. We expect our representations to be at the level of objects present in the image, and therefore align our representations with the output of an image encoder trained to discover objects. We show that by learning to group the tokens, the vision-language model has a better fine-grained understanding of vision and language. In addition, the token groups that our model discovers are highly similar to groundable phrases in text, both qualitatively and quantitatively.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes a model that groups caption tokens to better understand the relationship between images and text, achieving a more fine-grained representation at the object level.", "motivation": "Current vision-language models struggle with fine-grained understanding because they align image patches with individual tokens, which lack inherent meaning.

However, existing models are typically trained without supervision that explicitly encodes these relational dependencies, limiting their ability to infer how agents and other traffic entities influence one another from raw sensor data. In this work, we bridge this gap with a novel model-agnostic method that conditions language-based driving models on structured relational context in the form of traffic scene graphs. We serialize scene graphs at various abstraction levels and formats, and incorporate them into the models via structured prompt templates, enabling a systematic analysis of when and how relational supervision is most beneficial. Extensive evaluations on the public LangAuto benchmark show that scene graph conditioning of state-of-the-art approaches yields large and persistent improvement in driving performance. Notably, we observe up to a 15.6\\% increase in driving score for LMDrive and 17.5\\% for BEVDriver, indicating that models can better internalize and ground relational priors through scene graph-conditioned training, even without requiring scene graph input at test-time.

However, current self-supervised features entangle high-level semantics with low-level physical factors, such as geometry and illumination, hindering their use in tasks requiring explicit physical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce $\u03a6$eat, a novel physically-grounded visual backbone that encourages a representation sensitive to material identity, including reflectance cues and geometric mesostructure. Our key idea is to employ a pretraining strategy that contrasts spatial crops and physical augmentations of the same material under varying shapes and lighting conditions. While similar data have been used in high-end supervised tasks such as intrinsic decomposition or material estimation, we demonstrate that a pure self-supervised training strategy, without explicit labels, already provides a strong prior for tasks requiring robust features invariant to external physical factors. We evaluate the learned representations through feature similarity analysis and material selection, showing that $\u03a6$eat captures physically-grounded structure beyond semantic grouping.

However, this process is often prone to biases, errors, and distribution imbalance, resulting in overfitting and imbalanced performance. Although a few studies have tried to address this problem by generating synthetic data, they lacked control over distribution bias and annotation quality. To address these challenges, we redesign the fine-tuning process in two ways. First, we control the generation of data and its annotations, ensuring it is free from bias, distribution imbalance, and annotation errors. We automatically construct the dataset by comprehensively sampling objects' attributes, including color, shape, size, and position within the scene.

While recent methods have shown promise by contrasting spatial relationships between slices, they rely on hard binary thresholds to define positive and negative samples, thereby discarding valuable continuous information about anatomical similarity. Moreover, these methods overlook the global directional consistency of anatomical progression, resulting in distorted feature spaces that fail to capture the canonical anatomical manifold shared across patients. To address these limitations, we propose Coordinative Ordinal-Relational Anatomical Learning (CORAL) to capture both local and global structure in volumetric images. First, CORAL employs a contrastive ranking objective to leverage continuous anatomical similarity, ensuring relational feature distances between slices are proportional to their anatomical position differences. In addition, CORAL incorporates an ordinal objective to enforce global directional consistency, aligning the learned feature distribution with the canonical anatomical progression across patients. Learning these inter-slice relationships produces anatomically informed representations that benefit the downstream segmentation task. Through this coordinative learning framework, CORAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets under limited-annotation settings while learning representations with meaningful anatomical structure.

Generic augmentations show inconsistent gains under such shifts, whereas dataset-specific augmentations require expert knowledge and prior analysis. Moreover, prior studies show that neural networks adapt poorly to domain shifts because they exhibit a learning bias to domain-specific frequency components. Perturbing frequency values can mitigate such bias but overlooks pixel-level details, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these problems, we propose D-GAP (Dataset-agnostic and Gradient-guided augmentation in Amplitude and Pixel spaces), improving OOD robustness by introducing targeted augmentation in both the amplitude space (frequency space) and pixel space. Unlike conventional handcrafted augmentations, D-GAP computes sensitivity maps in the frequency space from task gradients, which reflect how strongly the model responds to different frequency components, and uses the maps to adaptively interpolate amplitudes between source and target samples.

To address this, we propose DocLens, a tool-augmented multi-agent framework that effectively ``zooms in'' on evidence like a lens.

Current deep learning-based methods rely on training with hand-crafted noise simulation layers, which inherently limit their generalization to unforeseen distortions. In this work, we propose $\\textbf{SimuFreeMark}$, a noise-$\\underline{\\text{simu}}$lation-$\\underline{\\text{free}}$ water$\\underline{\\text{mark}}$ing framework that circumvents this limitation by exploiting the inherent stability of image low-frequency components. We first systematically establish that low-frequency components exhibit significant robustness against a wide range of attacks.

Code: https://github.com/HaokunChen245/AUVIC", "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve impressive performance once optimized on massive datasets. Such datasets often contain sensitive or copyrighted content, raising significant data privacy concerns. Regulatory frameworks mandating the 'right to be forgotten' drive the need for machine unlearning. This technique allows for the removal of target data without resource-consuming retraining. However, while well-studied for text, visual concept unlearning in MLLMs remains underexplored. A primary challenge is precisely removing a target visual concept without disrupting model performance on related entities. To address this, we introduce AUVIC, a novel visual concept unlearning framework for MLLMs. AUVIC applies adversarial perturbations to enable precise forgetting. This approach effectively isolates the target concept while avoiding unintended effects on similar entities. To evaluate our method, we construct VCUBench. It is the first benchmark designed to assess visual concept unlearning in group contexts.

While synthetic data has become fundamental in frame-based computer vision, event-based vision lacks comparable comprehensive resources. Addressing this gap, we present 50,000 event sequences of 34 ms duration each, synthesized from Physically Based Rendering (PBR) scenes of YCB-Video objects following the Benchmark for 6D Object Pose (BOP) methodology. Our generation framework employs simulated linear camera motion to ensure complete scene coverage, including background activity.\n  Through systematic evaluation of event representations for CNN-based inference, we demonstrate that time-surfaces with linear decay and dual-channel polarity encoding achieve superior pose estimation performance, outperforming exponential decay and single-channel alternatives by significant margins. Our analysis reveals that polarity information contributes most substantially to performance gains, while linear temporal encoding preserves critical motion information more effectively than exponential decay. The dataset is provided in a structured format with both raw event streams and precomputed optimal representations to facilitate immediate research use and reproducible benchmarking.\n  The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/paroj/ycbev_sd.", "AI": {"tldr": "YCB-Ev SD\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e6DoF\u7269\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u50cf\u4f20\u7edf\u5e27\u57fa\u89c6\u89c9\u90a3\u6837\u5168\u9762\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u800c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u751f\u6210\u4e8650,000\u4e2a\u65f6\u957f\u4e3a34\u6beb\u79d2\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e8f\u5217\u662f\u4f7f\u7528YCB-Video\u7269\u4f53\u5728\u7269\u7406\u6e32\u67d3(PBR)\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u9075\u5faaBOP\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u751f\u6210\u7684\u3002\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u573a\u666f\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u80cc\u666f\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u7528\u4e8e\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc(CNN)\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u9762\u8868\u793a\uff08\u7ebf\u6027\u8870\u51cf\u3001\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\uff09\u548c\u6781\u6027\u7f16\u7801\uff08\u53cc\u901a\u9053\u3001\u5355\u901a\u9053\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u9762\u7ed3\u5408\u7ebf\u6027\u8870\u51cf\u548c\u53cc\u901a\u9053\u6781\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u5728\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u548c\u5355\u901a\u9053\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6781\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8d21\u732e\u6700\u5927\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u6bd4\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u66f4\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "YCB-Ev SD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89c6\u89c9\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9d\u8d35\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u5728CNN\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6781\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u9762\u8868\u793a\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7269\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Free3D introduces a Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ) that maps 2D motion sequences into 3D-consistent latent spaces, and a suite of 3D-free regularization objectives enforcing view consistency, orientation coherence, and physical plausibility. Trained entirely on 2D motion data, Free3D generates diverse, temporally coherent, and semantically aligned 3D motions, achieving performance comparable to or even surpassing fully 3D-supervised counterparts.

However, these models are often trained in a supervised manner, which requires large labeled datasets. Unsupervised approaches do not require ground-truth data for learning, but suffer from long segmentation times and often worse segmentation accuracy. Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) are an unsupervised segmentation approach that incorporates concepts of neighborhood and class distributions. We present a method that integrates HMRF theory and CNN segmentation, leveraging the advantages of both areas: unsupervised learning and fast segmentation times. We investigate the contribution of different neighborhood terms and components for the unsupervised HMRF loss. We demonstrate that the HMRF-UNet enables high segmentation accuracy without ground truth on a Micro-Computed Tomography ($\u03bc$CT) image dataset of Polyurethane (PU) foam structures.

Since the meaning of different emotional fluctuations may differ under different emotional contexts, the core limitation is the lack of a hierarchical structural mechanism to disentangle distinct affective components, i.e., emotional bases (the long-term emotional tone), and transient fluctuations (the short-term emotional fluctuations). To address this, we propose the Low-Rank Sparse Emotion Understanding Framework (LSEF), a unified model grounded in the Low-Rank Sparse Principle, which theoretically reframes affective dynamics as a hierarchical low-rank sparse compositional process. LSEF employs three plug-and-play modules, i.e., the Stability Encoding Module (SEM) captures low-rank emotional bases; the Dynamic Decoupling Module (DDM) isolates sparse transient signals; and the Consistency Integration Module (CIM) reconstructs multi-scale stability and reactivity coherence. This framework is optimized by a Rank Aware Optimization (RAO) strategy that adaptively balances gradient smoothness and sensitivity. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets confirm that LSEF significantly enhances robustness and dynamic discrimination, which further validates the effectiveness and generality of hierarchical low-rank sparse modeling for understanding affective dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLSEF\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u7a00\u758f\u60c5\u611f\u7406\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u9891\u60c5\u611f\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u7a33\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u9000\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u60c5\u611f\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08VAC\uff09\u5bf9\u4e8e\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u7a33\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u5728\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u611f\u6210\u5206\uff08\u957f\u671f\u60c5\u611f\u57fa\u8c03\u548c\u77ed\u671f\u60c5\u611f\u6ce2\u52a8\uff09\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f4e\u79e9\u7a00\u758f\u60c5\u611f\u7406\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff08LSEF\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4e\u79e9\u7a00\u758f\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u5c06\u60c5\u611f\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u7a00\u758f\u7ec4\u5408\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002LSEF\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u5757\uff08SEM\uff09\u6355\u83b7\u4f4e\u79e9\u60c5\u611f\u57fa\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u89e3\u8026\u6a21\u5757\uff08DDM\uff09\u5206\u79bb\u7a00\u758f\u77ac\u6001\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6574\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff08CIM\uff09\u91cd\u5efa\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u79e9\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\uff08RAO\uff09\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLSEF\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u4f4e\u79e9\u7a00\u758f\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u60c5\u611f\u52a8\u6001\u65b9\u9762\u662f\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u3002"}}

To bridge this gap, we propose Q-Doc, a three-tiered evaluation framework for systematically probing DIQA capabilities of MLLMs at coarse, middle, and fine granularity levels. a) At the coarse level, we instruct MLLMs to assign quality scores to document images and analyze their correlation with Quality Annotations. b) At the middle level, we design distortion-type identification tasks, including single-choice and multi-choice tests for multi-distortion scenarios. c) At the fine level, we introduce distortion-severity assessment where MLLMs classify distortion intensity against human-annotated references. Our evaluation demonstrates that while MLLMs possess nascent DIQA abilities, they exhibit critical limitations: inconsistent scoring, distortion misidentification, and severity misjudgment. Significantly, we show that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting substantially enhances performance across all levels.

Vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong transferable representations via multi-modal supervision, making them promising for CIL. However, applying CLIP to CIL poses two major challenges: (1) adapting to downstream tasks often requires additional learnable modules, increasing model complexity and susceptibility to forgetting; and (2) while multi-modal representations offer complementary strengths, existing methods have yet to fully realize their potential in effectively integrating visual and textual modalities. To address these issues, we propose BOFA (Bridge-layer Orthogonal Fusion for Adaptation), a novel framework for CIL. BOFA confines all model adaptation exclusively to CLIP's existing cross-modal bridge-layer, thereby adding no extra parameters or inference cost. To prevent forgetting within this layer, it leverages Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion, a mechanism that constrains parameter updates to a low-rank ``safe subspace\" mathematically constructed to be orthogonal to past task features.

We argue that the relationship between visual and brain modalities is fundamentally asymmetric, characterized by two critical gaps: a Fidelity Gap (stemming from EEG's inherent noise and signal degradation, vs. vision's high-fidelity features) and a Semantic Gap (arising from EEG's shallow conceptual representation, vs. vision's rich semantic depth). Previous methods often overlook this asymmetry, forcing alignment between the two modalities as if they were equal partners and thereby leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose the adaptive teaching paradigm. This paradigm empowers the ``teacher\" modality (vision) to dynamically shrink and adjust its knowledge structure under task guidance, tailoring its semantically dense features to match the ``student\" modality (EEG)'s capacity. We implement this paradigm with the ShrinkAdapter, a simple yet effective module featuring a residual-free design and a bottleneck structure. Through extensive experiments, we validate the underlying rationale and effectiveness of our paradigm. Our method achieves a top-1 accuracy of 60.2\\% on the zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 9.8\\%.

First, we construct a unified multilingual dataset spanning 10 languages, by systematically expanding 12 existing English REC benchmarks through machine translation and context-based translation enhancement. The resulting dataset comprises approximately 8 million multilingual referring expressions across 177,620 images, with 336,882 annotated objects. Second, we introduce an attention-anchored neural architecture that uses multilingual SigLIP2 encoders. Our attention-based approach generates coarse spatial anchors from attention distributions, which are subsequently refined through learned residuals. Experimental evaluation demonstrates competitive performance on standard benchmarks, e.g. achieving 86.9% accuracy at IoU@50 on RefCOCO aggregate multilingual evaluation, compared to an English-only result of 91.3%.

However, existing datasets and benchmarks focus primarily on single-turn interactions, failing to capture the multi-turn, context-dependent nature of real-world image creation and editing. To address this gap, we present WEAVE, the first suite for in-context interleaved cross-modality comprehension and generation. Our suite consists of two complementary parts. WEAVE-100k is a large-scale dataset of 100K interleaved samples spanning over 370K dialogue turns and 500K images, covering comprehension, editing, and generation tasks that require reasoning over historical context. WEAVEBench is a human-annotated benchmark with 100 tasks based on 480 images, featuring a hybrid VLM judger evaluation framework based on both the reference image and the combination of the original image with editing instructions that assesses models' abilities in multi-turn generation, visual memory, and world-knowledge reasoning across diverse domains. Experiments demonstrate that training on WEAVE-100k enables vision comprehension, image editing, and comprehension-generation collaboration capabilities. Furthermore, it facilitates UMMs to develop emergent visual-memory capabilities, while extensive evaluations on WEAVEBench expose the persistent limitations and challenges of current approaches in multi-turn, context-aware image generation and editing.

This refers to instances where images and texts evoke culturally shared associations, such as when a title recalls a familiar artwork or film scene. While prior research on memorization and unlearning emphasizes forgetting, we examine what is remembered and how, focusing on the balance between recognizing cultural references and reproducing them. We introduce an evaluation framework that separates recognition, whether a model identifies a reference, from realization, how it depicts it through replication or reinterpretation, quantified through measures capturing both dimensions. By evaluating five diffusion models across 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references spanning static and dynamic imagery, we show that our framework distinguishes replication from transformation more effectively than existing similarity-based methods. To assess linguistic sensitivity, we conduct prompt perturbation experiments using synonym substitutions and literal image descriptions, finding that models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered. Finally, our analysis shows that cultural alignment correlates not only with training data frequency, but also textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date. Our work reveals that the value of diffusion models lies not only in what they reproduce but in how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge, advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching toward richer contextual understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6587\u751f\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6587\u5316\u7b26\u53f7\u65f6\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u201c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7b26\u53f7\u5b66\u201d\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u518d\u73b0\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6587\u5316\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u8fa8\u8ba4\u548c\u63cf\u7ed8\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u6539\u53d8\u65f6\uff0c\u4e5f\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u590d\u5236\u6807\u5fd7\u6027\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e14\u6587\u5316\u5173\u8054\u6027\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9891\u7387\u3001\u6587\u672c\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u3001\u5f15\u7528\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u548c\u521b\u4f5c\u65e5\u671f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u91cd\u5851\u548c\u518d\u8bed\u5883\u5316\u6587\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u751f\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u201c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7b26\u53f7\u5b66\u201d\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5373\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5982\u4f55\u5524\u8d77\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u6587\u5316\u8054\u60f3\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u518d\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6587\u5316\u53c2\u8003\u7269\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8bc6\u522b\uff08\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u8ba4\u51fa\u53c2\u8003\u7269\uff09\u548c\u518d\u73b0\uff08\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u5236\u6216\u91cd\u65b0\u8be0\u91ca\u6765\u63cf\u7ed8\u5b83\uff09\u5206\u5f00\u91cf\u5316\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u57285\u4e2a\u6587\u751f\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30767\u4e2a\u7ef4\u57fa\u6570\u636e\u884d\u751f\u7684\u6587\u5316\u53c2\u8003\u7269\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u6270\u52a8\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u540c\u4e49\u8bcd\u66ff\u6362\u548c\u5b57\u9762\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\uff09\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5730\u533a\u5206\u590d\u5236\u548c\u8f6c\u6362\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6587\u672c\u7ebf\u7d22\u6539\u53d8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u5e38\u5e38\u4f1a\u91cd\u73b0\u6807\u5fd7\u6027\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u6587\u5316\u5173\u8054\u6027\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9891\u7387\u6709\u5173\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u3001\u53c2\u8003\u7269\u7684\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u548c\u521b\u4f5c\u65e5\u671f\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u751f\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u5728\u4e8e\u5176\u91cd\u5851\u548c\u518d\u8bed\u5883\u5316\u6587\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u590d\u5236\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u8d85\u8d8a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u56fe\u6587\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u8f6c\u5411\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bed\u5883\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

This overlooks the brain's hierarchical processing and blurs the roles of early, middle, and late visual areas. We propose Hi-DREAM, a brain-inspired conditional diffusion framework that makes the cortical organization explicit. A region-of-interest (ROI) adapter groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams and converts them into a multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with the U-Net depth (shallow scales preserve layout and edges; deeper scales emphasize objects and semantics). A lightweight, depth-matched ControlNet injects these scale-specific hints during denoising. The result is an efficient and interpretable decoder in which each signal plays a brain-like role, allowing the model not only to reconstruct images but also to illuminate functional contributions of different visual areas. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) show that Hi-DREAM attains state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining competitive low-level fidelity.

When querying specific regions or objects in an image, human users naturally use \"visual prompts\" (VPs), such as bounding boxes, to provide reference. However, no existing benchmark systematically evaluates the ability of MLLMs to interpret such VPs. This gap leaves it unclear whether current MLLMs can effectively recognize VPs, an intuitive prompting method for humans, and use them to solve problems. To address this limitation, we introduce VP-Bench, a benchmark for assessing MLLMs' capability in VP perception and utilization. VP-Bench employs a two-stage evaluation framework: Stage 1 examines models' ability to perceive VPs in natural scenes, using 30k visualized prompts spanning eight shapes and 355 attribute combinations. Stage 2 investigates the impact of VPs on downstream tasks, measuring their effectiveness in real-world problem-solving scenarios. Using VP-Bench, we evaluate 28 MLLMs, including proprietary systems (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL3 and Qwen2.5-VL), and provide a comprehensive analysis of factors that affect VP understanding, such as variations in VP attributes, question arrangement, and model scale. VP-Bench establishes a new reference framework for studying how MLLMs comprehend and resolve grounded referring questions.", "AI": {"tldr": "VP-Bench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\uff08VPs\uff09\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u672a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7406\u89e3\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\uff08VPs\uff09\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800cVPs\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u6216\u5bf9\u8c61\u65f6\u81ea\u7136\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u5f53\u524dMLLMs\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5229\u7528VPs\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "VP-Bench\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u752830,000\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u6db5\u76d68\u79cd\u5f62\u72b6\u548c355\u79cd\u5c5e\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\uff09\u6765\u8003\u5bdf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u611f\u77e5VPs\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u7814\u7a76VPs\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8861\u91cf\u5176\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528VP-Bench\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5305\u62ecGPT-4o\u3001InternVL3\u548cQwen2.5-VL\u5728\u5185\u768428\u4e2aMLLMs\uff0c\u5e76\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5f71\u54cdVP\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5982VP\u5c5e\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u95ee\u9898\u6392\u5217\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u3002", "conclusion": "VP-Bench\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76MLLMs\u5982\u4f55\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6307\u4ee3\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Existing two-stage adaptation methods are computationally expensive and assume complete multimodal data during training, limiting their generalization to real-world incompleteness. To overcome these issues, we propose a Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL) framework that reformulates modality missing as a multi-task learning problem. MaMOL introduces a dual-routing mechanism: a task-oriented dynamic router that adaptively activates experts for different missing patterns, and a modality-specific-shared static router that maintains stable cross-modal knowledge sharing. Unlike prior methods that train separate networks for each missing configuration, MaMOL achieves parameter-efficient adaptation via lightweight expert updates and shared expert reuse. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate superior robustness and generalization under varying missing rates, with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, transfer experiments on natural image datasets validate its scalability and cross-domain applicability, highlighting MaMOL as a general and efficient solution for incomplete multimodal learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMaMOL\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u56e0\u73af\u5883\u5e72\u6270\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6545\u969c\u6216\u5927\u6c14\u5f71\u54cd\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u5047\u8bbe\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u5b8c\u6574\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "MaMOL\u5c06\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u53cc\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u5f0f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e13\u5bb6\uff1b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u9759\u6001\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e13\u5bb6\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u4e13\u5bb6\u590d\u7528\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9065\u611f\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMaMOL\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7f3a\u5931\u7387\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u6781\u5c0f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e5f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u57df\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MaMOL\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

However, no equivalent assistance exists for physical chess games, creating a divide between analog and digital chess experiences. This paper presents CVChess, a deep learning framework for converting chessboard images to Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN), which is later input into online chess engines to provide you with the best next move. Our approach employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) with residual layers to perform piece recognition from smartphone camera images. The system processes RGB images of a physical chess board through a multistep process: image preprocessing using the Hough Line Transform for edge detection, projective transform to achieve a top-down board alignment, segmentation into 64 individual squares, and piece classification into 13 classes (6 unique white pieces, 6 unique black pieces and an empty square) using the residual CNN.

Although VLLMs excel in Visual Question Answering (VQA) on multi-page VRDs, their ability to detect unanswerable questions is still an open research question. Our research delves into the robustness of the VLLMs to plausible yet unanswerable questions, i.e., questions that appear valid but cannot be answered due to subtle corruptions caused by swaps between related concepts or plausible question formulations. Corruptions are generated by replacing the original natural language entities with other ones of the same type, belonging to different document elements, and in different layout positions or pages of the related document. To this end, we present VRD-UQA (VISUALLY RICH DOCUMENT UNANSWERABLE QUESTION ANSWERING), a benchmark for evaluating VLLMs' resilience to plausible yet unanswerable questions across multiple dimensions. It automatically alters the questions of existing VQA datasets consisting of multi-page VRDs, verifies their unanswerability using a VLLM-as-a-judge approach, and then thoroughly evaluates VLLMs' performance. Experiments, run on 12 models, analyze: (1) The VLLMs' accuracy in detecting unanswerable questions at both page and document levels; (2) The effect of different types of corruption (NLP entity, document element, layout); (3) The effectiveness of different knowledge injection strategies based on in-context learning (OCR, multi-page selection, or the possibility of unanswerability). Our findings reveal VLLMs' limitations and demonstrate that VRD-UQA can serve as an evaluation framework for developing resilient document VQA systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "VLLMs \u5728\u7406\u89e3\u5305\u542b\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u591a\u9875\u89c6\u89c9\u4e30\u5bcc\u6587\u6863\uff08VRDs\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u68c0\u6d4b\u65e0\u6cd5\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u662f\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u8bfe\u9898\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 VRD-UQA \u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30 VLLMs \u5bf9\u770b\u4f3c\u5408\u7406\u4f46\u56e0\u7ec6\u5fae\u6982\u5ff5\u66ff\u6362\u6216\u5408\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u8868\u8ff0\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u4fee\u6539\u73b0\u6709 VQA \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684 VRDs \u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528 VLLM \u4f5c\u4e3a\u88c1\u5224\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u5426\u65e0\u6cd5\u56de\u7b54\uff0cVRD-UQA \u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86 VLLMs \u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86 VLLMs \u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u660e VRD-UQA \u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u9c81\u68d2\u6587\u6863 VQA \u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30 VLLMs \u5728\u5904\u7406\u5305\u542b\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u591a\u9875\u89c6\u89c9\u4e30\u5bcc\u6587\u6863\uff08VRDs\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65e0\u6cd5\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5bf9\u7ec6\u5fae\u6982\u5ff5\u66ff\u6362\u6216\u5408\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u8868\u8ff0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa VRD-UQA \u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u4fee\u6539\u73b0\u6709 VQA \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684 VRDs \u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528 VLLM \u4f5c\u4e3a\u88c1\u5224\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u5426\u65e0\u6cd5\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30 VLLMs \u5bf9\u53ef\u7591\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u97e7\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86 VLLMs \u5728\u9875\u9762\u548c\u6587\u6863\u7ea7\u522b\u68c0\u6d4b\u65e0\u6cd5\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\uff08NLP \u5b9e\u4f53\u3001\u6587\u6863\u5143\u7d20\u3001\u5e03\u5c40\uff09\u8150\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u7b56\u7565\uff08OCR\u3001\u591a\u9875\u9009\u62e9\u6216\u65e0\u6cd5\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff09\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728 12 \u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86 VLLMs \u5728\u9875\u9762\u548c\u6587\u6863\u7ea7\u522b\u68c0\u6d4b\u65e0\u6cd5\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u8150\u5316\uff08NLP \u5b9e\u4f53\u3001\u6587\u6863\u5143\u7d20\u3001\u5e03\u5c40\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u7b56\u7565\uff08OCR\u3001\u591a\u9875\u9009\u62e9\u6216\u65e0\u6cd5\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff09\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86 VLLMs \u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "VRD-UQA \u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u6587\u6863 VQA \u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9 VLLMs \u5728\u5904\u7406\u53ef\u7591\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing methods face two key challenges: (1) the need for large-scale 3D city assets for supervised training, which are difficult and costly to obtain, and (2) reliance on semantic or height maps, which are used exclusively for generating buildings in virtual worlds and lack connection to real-world appearance, limiting the realism and generalizability of generated cities. To address these limitations, we propose Sat2RealCity, a geometry-aware and appearance-controllable framework for 3D urban generation from real-world satellite imagery. Unlike previous city-level generation methods, Sat2RealCity builds generation upon individual building entities, enabling the use of rich priors and pretrained knowledge from 3D object generation while substantially reducing dependence on large-scale 3D city assets. Specifically, (1) we introduce the OSM-based spatial priors strategy to achieve interpretable geometric generation from spatial topology to building instances; (2) we design an appearance-guided controllable modeling mechanism for fine-grained appearance realism and style control; and (3) we construct an MLLM-powered semantic-guided generation pipeline, bridging semantic interpretation and geometric reconstruction. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that Sat2RealCity significantly surpasses existing baselines in structural consistency and appearance realism, establishing a strong foundation for real-world aligned 3D urban content creation.

Guided by a policy controller, multiple generation actions dynamically interact and self-organize to enhance image fidelity and semantic alignment without relying on external models. Extensive experiments on image generation and editing tasks demonstrate that ImAgent consistently improves over the backbone and even surpasses other strong baselines where the backbone model fails, highlighting the potential of unified multimodal agents for adaptive and efficient image generation under test-time scaling.", "AI": {"tldr": "ImAgent\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u7b56\u7565\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u7ec4\u7ec7\u591a\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u56fe\u50cf\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\uff08T2I\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u7cca\u6216\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u65f6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5e76\u4e14\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "ImAgent\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5b83\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u7531\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b56\u7565\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u591a\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u4f5c\u53ef\u4ee5\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "ImAgent\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5730\u4f18\u4e8e\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5176\u4ed6\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "ImAgent\u5728\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

We present nnUNet-B: a Bayesian segmentation framework that infers PD-L1 expression directly from H&E-stained histology images using Multimodal Posterior Sampling (MPS). Built upon nnUNet-v2, our method samples diverse model checkpoints during cyclic training to approximate the posterior, enabling both accurate segmentation and epistemic uncertainty estimation via entropy and standard deviation. Evaluated on a dataset of lung squamous cell carcinoma, our approach achieves competitive performance against established baselines with mean Dice Score and mean IoU of 0.805 and 0.709, respectively, while providing pixel-wise uncertainty maps.

Building on this finding, we introduce the Prelim Attention Score (PAS), a lightweight, training-free signal computed from attention weights over prelim tokens.

However, US image interpretation remains highly operator-dependent and varies significantly across anatomical regions, acquisition protocols, and device types. These variations, along with unique challenges such as speckle, low contrast, and limited standardized annotations, hinder the development of generalizable, label-efficient ultrasound AI models. In this paper, we propose OpenUS, the first reproducible, open-source ultrasound foundation model built on a large collection of public data. OpenUS employs a vision Mamba backbone, capturing both local and global long-range dependencies across the image. To extract rich features during pre-training, we introduce a novel self-adaptive masking framework that combines contrastive learning with masked image modeling. This strategy integrates the teacher's attention map with student reconstruction loss, adaptively refining clinically-relevant masking to enhance pre-training effectiveness. OpenUS also applies a dynamic learning schedule to progressively adjust the difficulty of the pre-training process. To develop the foundation model, we compile the largest to-date public ultrasound dataset comprising over 308K images from 42 publicly available datasets, covering diverse anatomical regions, institutions, imaging devices, and disease types. Our pre-trained OpenUS model can be easily adapted to specific downstream tasks by serving as a backbone for label-efficient fine-tuning.

Existing approaches typically fuse either (a) early: by mixing tokens/features inside the encoders, or (b) late: by comparing pooled embeddings. Many methods also tie fusion to an autoregressive decoder. However, the hidden states of both modalities already carry rich, modality-specific structure (spatial layout in vision; syntax and semantics in text), so directly aligning these states is a natural way to match what the two modalities \"think\". We propose a lightweight fusion module: a few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers placed near the top of both encoders. Each layer projects the vision and text encoder hidden-state sequences into a shared space, attends across modalities, and sends gated residual updates back, with simple stabilizers to improve alignment. The encoders remain non-causal and strong for understanding, while generation stays cleanly decoupled via an optional decoder. Across standard retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks, BRIDGE outperforms comparable VLMs while preserving the bi-encoder efficiency of contrastive models.

However, existing optimization-based reconstruction methods often require dense multi-view inputs and expensive per-instance optimization, limiting their scalability. Recent feedforward approaches offer faster alternatives but frequently produce coarse geometry, lack texture reconstruction, and rely on brittle, complex multi-stage pipelines. We introduce LARM, a unified feedforward framework that reconstructs 3D articulated objects from sparse-view images by jointly recovering detailed geometry, realistic textures, and accurate joint structures. LARM extends LVSM a recent novel view synthesis (NVS) approach for static 3D objects into the articulated setting by jointly reasoning over camera pose and articulation variation using a transformer-based architecture, enabling scalable and accurate novel view synthesis. In addition, LARM generates auxiliary outputs such as depth maps and part masks to facilitate explicit 3D mesh extraction and joint estimation. Our pipeline eliminates the need for dense supervision and supports high-fidelity reconstruction across diverse object categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LARM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both novel view and state synthesis as well as 3D articulated object reconstruction, generating high-quality meshes that closely adhere to the input images. project page: https://sylviayuan-sy.github.io/larm-site/", "AI": {"tldr": "LARM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u524d\u9988\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56fe\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa3D\u5173\u8282\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u6062\u590d\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u903c\u771f\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5173\u8282\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u56fe\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u524d\u9988\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u7c97\u7cd9\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7eb9\u7406\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8106\u5f31\u3001\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "LARM\u5c06LVSM\uff08\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u9759\u60013D\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u8fd1\u671f\u65b0\u9896\u89c6\u56fe\u5408\u6210\uff08NVS\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5173\u8282\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8054\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u52bf\u548c\u5173\u8282\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u89c6\u56fe\u5408\u6210\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cLARM\u751f\u6210\u8f85\u52a9\u8f93\u51fa\u6765\u4fbf\u4e8e\u663e\u5f0f3D\u7f51\u683c\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5173\u8282\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "LARM\u5728\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u56fe\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u5408\u6210\u4ee5\u53ca3D\u5173\u8282\u5bf9\u8c61\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7f51\u683c\u8d28\u91cf\u5f88\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u975e\u5e38\u543b\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "LARM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u524d\u9988\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56fe\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa3D\u5173\u8282\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u6062\u590d\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u903c\u771f\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5173\u8282\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}
