### [1] [Heatmap Regression without Soft-Argmax for Facial Landmark Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14929)
*Chiao-An Yang,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 面部地标检测的替代训练目标，比Soft-argmax更快、更准确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决在热图回归中用于面部地标检测的Soft-argmax的问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于经典结构化预测框架的替代训练目标，以取代Soft-argmax。

Result: 所提出的方法在三个面部地标基准上实现了最先进的性能，训练速度提高了2.2倍，同时保持了更好/有竞争力的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法在WFLW、COFW和300W三个面部地标基准上实现了最先进的性能，在保持更好/有竞争力的准确性的同时，训练速度提高了2.2倍。

Abstract: Facial landmark detection is an important task in computer vision with
numerous applications, such as head pose estimation, expression analysis, face
swapping, etc. Heatmap regression-based methods have been widely used to
achieve state-of-the-art results in this task. These methods involve computing
the argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not
differentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax,
to enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this
long-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the
only way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative
training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial
landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during
training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy. Our code is available
here: https://github.com/ca-joe-yang/regression-without-softarg.

### [2] [Fast Graph Neural Network for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14958)
*Mustafa Mohammadi Gharasuie,Luis Rueda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GCN 与 Voronoi 图的结合可以提高图像分类的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在图像分类中利用 GCN 处理复杂数据结构和 Voronoi 图的关联数据建模能力，以提高预处理效率和分类准确性。

Method: 提出了一种将 GCN 与 Voronoi 图相结合的新方法，将图像表示为图，并使用 Delaunay 三角剖分进行优化。

Result: 该模型在各种基准数据集上实现了显著的改进，特别是在处理复杂场景和细粒度类别方面，超越了现有技术。

Conclusion: 该研究通过结合 GCN 和 Voronoi 图，在图像分类方面取得了显著的改进，并在具有挑战性的场景中超越了现有方法。

Abstract: The rapid progress in image classification has been largely driven by the
adoption of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which offer a robust framework
for handling complex data structures. This study introduces a novel approach
that integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams to enhance image classification by
leveraging their ability to effectively model relational data. Unlike
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method represents images
as graphs, where pixels or regions function as vertices. These graphs are then
refined using corresponding Delaunay triangulations, optimizing their
representation. The proposed model achieves significant improvements in both
preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark
datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in challenging
scenarios involving intricate scenes and fine-grained categories. Experimental
results, validated through cross-validation, underscore the effectiveness of
combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for advancing image classification. This
research not only presents a novel perspective on image classification but also
expands the potential applications of graph-based learning paradigms in
computer vision and unstructured data analysis.

### [3] [You Only Pose Once: A Minimalist's Detection Transformer for Monocular RGB Category-level 9D Multi-Object Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14965)
*Hakjin Lee,Junghoon Seo,Jaehoon Sim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOPO是一个仅限RGB的单阶段框架，将2D检测和9-DoF姿态估计统一起来，无需额外数据即可实现最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在寻找一种更简单、仅限RGB的替代方案，直接在类别级别进行学习，以解决从单个RGB图像中准确恢复特定类别中未见实例的完整9-DoF姿态这一核心挑战。

Method: YOPO框架，一个单阶段、基于查询的框架，将类别级别的9-DoF估计视为2D检测的自然延伸。它通过增强Transformer检测器，加入轻量级姿态头、边界框条件位移模块和6D感知匈牙利匹配成本来实现。

Result: YOPO在REAL275数据集上实现了79.6%的IoU50和54.1%的10°10cm指标，超越了先前仅限RGB的方法，并显著缩小了与RGB-D系统的差距。

Conclusion: YOPO是一个创新的框架，成功地将物体检测和9-DoF姿态估计统一起来，仅使用RGB图像和类别级别的姿态标签进行端到端训练。尽管设计简洁，YOPO在三个基准测试中都取得了新的state of the art，在REAL275数据集上取得了优异的性能，并且表现接近于使用RGB-D系统的模型。

Abstract: Accurately recovering the full 9-DoF pose of unseen instances within specific
categories from a single RGB image remains a core challenge for robotics and
automation. Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or
multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated
by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the
category level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and
9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional
data? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based
framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of
2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose
head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian
matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and
category-level pose labels. Despite its minimalist design, YOPO sets a new
state of the art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6%
$\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric, surpassing
prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems. The code,
models, and additional qualitative results can be found on our project.

### [4] [Image-Conditioned 3D Gaussian Splat Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15372)
*Xinshuang Liu,Runfa Blark Li,Keito Suzuki,Truong Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ICGS-Quantizer 是一种新的 3DGS 压缩方法，可将存储需求降低到千字节范围，并适应场景变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有 3DGS 压缩方法在存档使用方面的局限性，即它们只能将中等规模的场景压缩到兆字节范围，这对于大规模场景或广泛的场景集合来说不切实际，并且缺乏适应存档后场景变化的机制。

Method: ICGS-Quantizer 通过联合利用高斯之间和属性之间的相关性，并跨所有训练场景使用共享的、固定的码本，从而提高了量化效率。然后将这些码本应用于以前未见过的测试场景，从而消除了每个场景码本的开销。为了实现对存档后场景变化的适应性，ICGS-Quantizer 根据解码时捕获的图像对场景解码进行条件化。编码、量化和解码过程被联合训练。

Result: ICGS-Quantizer 在压缩效率和适应场景变化方面持续优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: ICGS-Quantizer 在 3DGS 压缩效率和适应场景变化方面优于最先进的方法，能够将 3DGS 的存储需求减少到千字节范围，同时保持视觉保真度，并通过在解码时根据图像对场景进行条件化来适应场景的长期存档。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for
enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods
have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two
limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to
the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or
extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene
changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an
Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially
enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes
after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly
exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared
codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to
previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.
This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the
kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to
post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images
captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes
are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized
representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We
evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.
Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene
changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.

### [5] [Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework for Joint Physical-Digital Face Attack Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14980)
*Andrei Balykin,Anvar Ganiev,Denis Kondranin,Kirill Polevoda,Nikolai Liudkevich,Artem Petrov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的配对采样对比框架，用于统一检测物理和数字欺骗攻击，在基准测试中取得了最先进的性能，并且该框架轻量级且训练速度快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现代人脸识别系统易受物理和数字伪造等欺骗攻击的问题，并克服为不同攻击向量维护独立模型导致的系统复杂性增加、推理延迟和对组合攻击向量的暴露等缺点。

Method: 提出了一种名为“配对采样对比框架”的统一训练方法，该方法利用自动匹配的真实自拍和攻击自拍配对，学习与模态无关的活体检测线索。

Result: 所提出的框架轻量级（4.46 GFLOPs），训练时间不到一小时，适用于实际部署，并在第六届人脸防欺骗挑战赛的混合物理数字攻击检测基准测试中取得了2.10%的平均分类错误率（ACER）。

Conclusion: 该方法在第六届人脸防欺骗挑战赛的混合物理数字攻击检测基准测试中，实现了2.10%的平均分类错误率（ACER），优于现有方法。

Abstract: Modern face recognition systems remain vulnerable to spoofing attempts,
including both physical presentation attacks and digital forgeries.
Traditionally, these two attack vectors have been handled by separate models,
each targeting its own artifacts and modalities. However, maintaining distinct
detectors increases system complexity and inference latency and leaves systems
exposed to combined attack vectors. We propose the Paired-Sampling Contrastive
Framework, a unified training approach that leverages automatically matched
pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues.
Evaluated on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge Unified Physical-Digital
Attack Detection benchmark, our method achieves an average classification error
rate (ACER) of 2.10 percent, outperforming prior solutions. The framework is
lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour, making it practical for
real-world deployment. Code and pretrained models are available at

### [6] [TAIGen: Training-Free Adversarial Image Generation via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15020)
*Susim Roy,Anubhooti Jain,Mayank Vatsa,Richa Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAIGen 是一种快速（10 倍加速）且高质量的对抗性攻击方法，利用扩散模型在少数采样步骤内生成样本，并采用创新的 RGB 通道扰动策略，有效降低了目标模型的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于生成模型的对抗性攻击通常会产生低质量图像并需要大量计算资源。虽然扩散模型能生成高质量图像，但其对抗性生成通常需要数百个采样步骤。因此，需要一种更高效的对抗性图像生成方法。

Method: TAIGen 是一种无需训练的黑盒方法，通过在混合步骤间隔注入扰动来生成对抗性样本，并采用选择性的 RGB 通道策略：对红色通道应用注意力图，对绿色和蓝色通道应用 GradCAM 引导的扰动。

Result: TAIGen 在 ImageNet 数据集上，使用 VGGNet 作为源模型，针对 ResNet 实现了 70.6% 的成功率，针对 MNASNet 实现了 80.8% 的成功率，针对 ShuffleNet 实现了 97.8% 的成功率。该方法生成的对抗性样本比现有的基于扩散的攻击快 10 倍，并且视觉质量（PSNR>30 dB）得到了保证。TAIGen 实现了最低的鲁棒准确率，表明其作为攻击方法的有效性。

Conclusion: TAIGen 是一种高效、无需训练的黑盒对抗性图像生成方法，它使用扩散模型，只需 3-20 个采样步骤即可生成高质量的对抗性样本。通过在混合步骤间隔注入扰动并结合选择性的 RGB 通道策略（对红色通道使用注意力图，对绿色和蓝色通道使用 GradCAM 引导的扰动），TAIGen 在保持图像视觉质量（PSNR>30 dB）的同时，最大限度地提高了目标模型的误分类率。TAIGen 的生成速度比现有的基于扩散的攻击快 10 倍，并且由于其生成的对抗性样本最难被净化，因此具有最低的鲁棒准确率，表明其作为攻击方法的有效性。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks from generative models often produce low-quality images
and require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models, though
capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps
for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free
black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces
adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional
diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the
mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing
all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies
attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on
green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing
misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR
above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source,
TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8%
against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than
existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust
accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism
is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.

### [7] [Reliable Multi-view 3D Reconstruction for `Just-in-time' Edge Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15158)
*Md. Nurul Absur,Abhinav Kumar,Swastik Brahma,Saptarshi Debroy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于投资组合理论的边缘资源管理策略，以提高多视图3D重建在相机中断下的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了应对边缘计算环境中多视图3D重建因相机运行中断而导致的可靠性问题，本研究提出了一种新的资源管理策略。

Method: 提出了一种受投资组合理论启发的边缘资源管理策略，并使用遗传算法求解投资组合理论优化问题。

Conclusion: 该方法通过一种受投资组合理论启发的边缘资源管理策略，可以保证在相机容易受到时空相关中断的情况下，实现可靠的多视图3D重建。

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications are revolutionizing critical use
cases that require rapid situational-awareness, such as emergency response,
tactical scenarios, and public safety. In many cases, their near-real-time
latency requirements and ad-hoc needs for compute resources necessitate
adoption of `Just-in-time' edge environments where the system is set up on the
fly to support the applications during the mission lifetime. However,
reliability issues can arise from the inherent dynamism and operational
adversities of such edge environments, resulting in spatiotemporally correlated
disruptions that impact the camera operations, which can lead to sustained
degradation of reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
portfolio theory inspired edge resource management strategy for reliable
multi-view 3D reconstruction against possible system disruptions. Our proposed
methodology can guarantee reconstruction quality satisfaction even when the
cameras are prone to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions. The portfolio
theoretic optimization problem is solved using a genetic algorithm that
converges quickly for realistic system settings. Using publicly available and
customized 3D datasets, we demonstrate the proposed camera selection strategy's
benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction against traditional
baseline strategies, under spatiotemporal disruptions.

*Gaurav Parmar,Or Patashnik,Daniil Ostashev,Kuan-Chieh Wang,Kfir Aberman,Srinivasa Narasimhan,Jun-Yan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新颖的组推理方法，通过将样本视为一个整体来解决生成模型中的样本冗余问题，显著提高了输出样本集的多样性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型通常独立采样，导致多样本输出冗余，限制用户选择和探索。本研究旨在提高样本集的多样性和质量。

Method: 提出了一种可扩展的组推理方法，将组推理形式化为二次整数分配问题，通过优化样本质量和组多样性来选择样本子集。同时，利用中间预测逐步修剪候选集以提高运行时效率。

Result: 实验证明，该方法在提高组多样性和质量方面显著优于独立采样基线和近期推理算法，并可推广到文本到图像、图像到图像、图像提示和视频生成等多种任务。

Conclusion: 该方法通过将多样本输出视为整体，在保持高质量的同时显著提高了样本集的多样性和多样性，并广泛适用于多种生成任务。

Abstract: Generative models typically sample outputs independently, and recent
inference-time guidance and scaling algorithms focus on improving the quality
of individual samples. However, in real-world applications, users are often
presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where
independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices
and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group
inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of
samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment
problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected
to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity
(binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively
prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to
scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method
significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent
sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes
across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image
prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple
outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.

### [9] [Reversible Unfolding Network for Concealed Visual Perception with Generative Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15027)
*Chunming He,Fengyang Xiao,Rihan Zhang,Chengyu Fang,Deng-Ping Fan,Sina Farsiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RUN++是一种新颖的CVP方法，通过可逆展开网络和扩散模型协同作用，在掩码和RGB域中都能有效处理不确定性，实现高效的细节恢复和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐蔽视觉感知（CVP）方法主要在掩码域利用可逆策略来降低不确定性，但忽略了RGB域的潜力。本文旨在解决这一局限性，探索在RGB域中应用可逆建模，以提高CVP的性能。

Method: RUN++提出了一种可逆展开网络与生成式细化相结合的方法。首先，将CVP任务表述为数学优化问题，并将迭代解展开为一个多阶段深度网络。网络中的每个阶段包含三个模块： CORE模块在掩码域应用可逆建模以识别核心对象区域； CARE模块将此原理扩展到RGB域，以促进前景-背景分离； FINE模块进行最终的细化，引入一种针对性的伯努利扩散模型，仅优化分割掩码的不确定区域，利用扩散模型的生成能力进行细节点恢复，避免了全图像处理的高计算成本。

Result: RUN++通过其独特的可逆展开网络和扩散模型的协同作用，能够有效地将焦点集中在模糊区域，显著减少了误报和漏报。该方法在RGB域中实现了高效的细节恢复和前景-背景分离。

Conclusion: RUN++通过将CVP任务制定为数学优化问题并将其展开为多阶段深度网络，解决了现有方法在RGB域中潜力未被充分利用的问题。该方法将可逆建模应用于掩码和RGB域，并利用扩散模型解决不确定性。通过CORE、CARE和FINE三个模块，实现了从掩码域到RGB域的精细化处理，尤其FINE模块通过针对性的伯努利扩散模型，仅优化不确定区域，在保证效率的同时实现细节恢复。该方法还引入了新的鲁棒CVP系统构建范式，并扩展到双层优化框架。

Abstract: Existing methods for concealed visual perception (CVP) often leverage
reversible strategies to decrease uncertainty, yet these are typically confined
to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To
address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative
refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as
a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a
multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply
reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a
diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network
integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction
(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core
object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this
principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;
and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a
final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion
model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,
harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration
without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique
synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for
the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward
ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.
Furthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that
remain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a
broader bi-level optimization framework.

*Yan Luo,Drake Du,Hao Huang,Yi Fang,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CurveFlow通过在流匹配框架中引入曲率引导，学习非线性轨迹，从而提高文本到图像生成中图像与文本的语义一致性，并在多项指标上取得SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流模型基于线性的轨迹，可能迫使图像生成过程通过数据流形的低概率区域。本文旨在探索轨迹曲率与生成图像与其对应标题的语义对齐（即指令依从性）之间的关系。

Method: CurveFlow是一个新颖的流匹配框架，通过直接将曲率引导融入流路径来学习平滑的非线性轨迹，并采用稳健的曲率正则化技术来惩罚轨迹内在动态的剧烈变化。

Result: 在MS COCO 2014和2017数据集上的大量实验表明，CurveFlow在文本到图像生成方面取得了最先进的性能，显著优于标准的流变体和Rectified Diffusion等非线性基线。尤其在BLEU、METEOR、ROUGE和CLAIR等语义一致性指标上表现突出，证实了曲率感知建模能有效提升模型忠实遵循复杂指令的能力并保持高质量的图像。

Conclusion: CurveFlow通过引入曲率感知的方法，在文本到图像生成任务中实现了最先进的性能，显著提高了生成图像与对应文本描述之间的语义一致性。

Abstract: Existing rectified flow models are based on linear trajectories between data
and noise distributions. This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can
inadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability
regions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does
the curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment
between generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional
compliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching
framework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly
incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a
robust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the
trajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017
demonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in
text-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified
flow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The
improvements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as
BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling
substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex
instructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality. The code is
made publicly available at

Method: HiRQA是一个无监督、无主观意见的框架，通过结合排名和对比学习，提供了一个分层的、感知的嵌入。与依赖原始参考或推理时辅助模态的先前方法不同，HiRQA仅使用输入图像来预测质量分数。引入了一种新颖的高阶排名损失，通过失真对之间的关系排序来监督质量预测，以及一种强制特征距离和感知差异之间一致性的嵌入距离损失。在结构化文本提示的指导下，训练时的对比对齐损失进一步增强了学习表示。

Result: HiRQA通过结合排名和对比学习，提供了一个分层的、感知的嵌入。训练时，它还利用结构化文本提示来进一步增强学习表示。HiRQA在各种数据集上都取得了最先进的性能，并在真实数据上表现出很强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: HiRQA在各种失真（例如镜头光晕、雾霾、运动模糊和低光照条件）上进行了评估，并且在合成失真上仅经过训练，就有效地泛化到真实失真。HiRQA-S 是一个轻量级变体，推理时间仅为每张图像 3.5 毫秒。 在合成和真实基准上的大量实验验证了 HiRQA 的最先进（SOTA）性能、强大的泛化能力和可扩展性。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in no-reference image quality assessment
(NR-IQA), dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels continue to hinder
their generalization performance. We propose HiRQA, Hierarchical Ranking and
Quality Alignment), a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework that offers a
hierarchical, quality-aware embedding through a combination of ranking and
contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that depend on pristine
references or auxiliary modalities at inference time, HiRQA predicts quality
scores using only the input image. We introduce a novel higher-order ranking
loss that supervises quality predictions through relational ordering across
distortion pairs, along with an embedding distance loss that enforces
consistency between feature distances and perceptual differences. A
training-time contrastive alignment loss, guided by structured textual prompts,
further enhances the learned representation. Trained only on synthetic
distortions, HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations, as
demonstrated through evaluation on various distortions such as lens flare,
haze, motion blur, and low-light conditions. For real-time deployment, we
introduce \textbf{HiRQA-S}, a lightweight variant with an inference time of
only 3.5 ms per image. Extensive experiments across synthetic and authentic
benchmarks validate HiRQA's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, strong
generalization ability, and scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在DR检测方面显示出潜力，但其黑盒性质因缺乏透明度和可解释性而阻碍了临床应用。

Method: XDR-LVLM集成了专业的医学视觉编码器、LVLM核心，并采用了多任务提示工程和多阶段微调，以深入理解眼底图像中的病理特征并生成全面的诊断报告。

Result: XDR-LVLM在DDR数据集上实现了最先进的性能，疾病诊断的平衡准确率为84.55%，F1分数为79.92%，概念检测方面也取得了优越的结果（BACC为77.95%，F1为66.88%）。此外，人类评估证实了生成解释的高度流畅性、准确性和临床实用性。

Conclusion: XDR-LVLM 通过提供可靠且可解释的见解，成功地弥合了自动化诊断与临床需求之间的差距。

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of global blindness, necessitating
early and accurate diagnosis. While deep learning models have shown promise in
DR detection, their black-box nature often hinders clinical adoption due to a
lack of transparency and interpretability. To address this, we propose XDR-LVLM
(eXplainable Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with LVLM), a novel framework that
leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for high-precision DR diagnosis
coupled with natural language-based explanations. XDR-LVLM integrates a
specialized Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, and employs Multi-task Prompt
Engineering and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to deeply understand pathological
features within fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports.
These reports explicitly include DR severity grading, identification of key
pathological concepts (e.g., hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms), and
detailed explanations linking observed features to the diagnosis. Extensive
experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy (DDR) dataset demonstrate that XDR-LVLM
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55% and
an F1 Score of 79.92% for disease diagnosis, and superior results for concept
detection (77.95% BACC, 66.88% F1). Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the
high fluency, accuracy, and clinical utility of the generated explanations,
showcasing XDR-LVLM's ability to bridge the gap between automated diagnosis and
clinical needs by providing robust and interpretable insights.

TL;DR: 该方法（MeSS）通过改进图像扩散模型来生成具有真实纹理的城市网格模型场景，解决了现有技术在交叉视图一致性和精确对齐方面的不足，并在几何对齐和生成质量上取得了更好的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决城市网格模型缺乏真实纹理的问题，该方法旨在生成高质量、风格一致的户外场景，并将城市网格模型作为几何先验。

Method: 该方法首先使用级联外绘画ControlNets生成几何一致的稀疏视图，然后通过AGInpaint传播更密集的中间视图，最后使用GCAlign模块消除全局视觉不一致性（例如，曝光变化）。在生成的同时，通过在网格表面上初始化高斯球来重建3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）场景。

Result: 该方法生成的场景在几何对齐和生成质量方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在几何对齐和生成质量方面均优于现有方法，并且能够通过重新照明和风格转换技术以多样化的风格渲染生成的场景。

Abstract: Mesh models have become increasingly accessible for numerous cities; however,
the lack of realistic textures restricts their application in virtual urban
navigation and autonomous driving. To address this, this paper proposes MeSS
(Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent
outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While
image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth
maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective
views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion
models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but
often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with
rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to
guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned
results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach
enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The
pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically
consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we
propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and
third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure)
using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh
surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment
and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse
styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术部位感染（SSI）是常见的医疗相关感染，而手术伤口护理是预防SSI和改善患者预后的关键挑战。现有研究在利用深度学习进行伤口筛查方面存在数据隐私和标注成本高的问题，且缺乏公开的数据集和基准测试。为了解决这些问题，本研究旨在创建一个开源数据集和相应的评估基准，并提出一个创新的学习框架来自动化和改进手术伤口诊断和护理。

Method: 该研究首先构建了首个开源的手术伤口数据集SurgWound，包含697张由3名专业外科医生标注的手术伤口图像。基于此数据集，研究提出了一个包含视觉问答（VQA）和报告生成任务的基准测试。在此基础上，作者设计了一个三阶段学习框架WoundQwen：第一阶段，利用五个独立的MLLM预测伤口特征；第二阶段，将预测的特征作为输入，训练两个MLLM来诊断伤口，评估感染风险并指导干预；第三阶段，训练一个MLLM整合前两个阶段的诊断结果，生成综合性报告。

Result: 研究构建了首个包含697张标注图像的手术伤口数据集SurgWound，并提出了相应的基准测试。所提出的WoundQwen框架能够准确预测手术伤口特征，评估感染风险，并生成包含个性化护理指导的综合性报告，为实现个性化伤口护理、及时干预和改善患者预后奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一个名为WoundQwen的三阶段学习框架，用于通过分析手术图像和相关特征来诊断伤口、评估感染风险并提供个性化的伤口护理指导，最终旨在改善患者预后。

Abstract: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common and costly
healthcare-associated infections and and surgical wound care remains a
significant clinical challenge in preventing SSIs and improving patient
outcomes. While recent studies have explored the use of deep learning for
preliminary surgical wound screening, progress has been hindered by concerns
over data privacy and the high costs associated with expert annotation.
Currently, no publicly available dataset or benchmark encompasses various types
of surgical wounds, resulting in the absence of an open-source Surgical-Wound
screening tool. To address this gap: (1) we present SurgWound, the first
open-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types. It
contains 697 surgical wound images annotated by 3 professional surgeons with
eight fine-grained clinical attributes. (2) Based on SurgWound, we introduce
the first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, which includes visual
question answering (VQA) and report generation tasks to comprehensively
evaluate model performance. (3) Furthermore, we propose a three-stage learning
framework, WoundQwen, for surgical wound diagnosis. In the first stage, we
employ five independent MLLMs to accurately predict specific surgical wound
characteristics. In the second stage, these predictions serve as additional
knowledge inputs to two MLLMs responsible for diagnosing outcomes, which assess
infection risk and guide subsequent interventions. In the third stage, we train
a MLLM that integrates the diagnostic results from the previous two stages to
produce a comprehensive report. This three-stage framework can analyze detailed
surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients
based on surgical images, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely
intervention, and improved patient outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, properly modeling rule-based surrounding agents is crucial. This paper aims to model adversarial behavior for these agents to create failure scenarios.

Method: A learning-based method was used to derive adversarial behavior for rule-based agents to cause failure scenarios.

Result: The adversarial agent caused a decrease in cumulative reward when tested against all rule-based agents.

Conclusion: The learning-based adversarial agent successfully generated failure scenarios by decreasing the cumulative reward when evaluated against rule-based agents.

Abstract: Existing approaches in reinforcement learning train an agent to learn desired
optimal behavior in an environment with rule based surrounding agents. In
safety critical applications such as autonomous driving it is crucial that the
rule based agents are modelled properly. Several behavior modelling strategies
and IDM models are used currently to model the surrounding agents. We present a
learning based method to derive the adversarial behavior for the rule based
agents to cause failure scenarios. We evaluate our adversarial agent against
all the rule based agents and show the decrease in cumulative reward.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Existing methods for segmenting renal pathology use binary masks, limiting precision. This paper presents DyMorph-B2I, a pipeline that uses a combination of watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations with adaptive refinement to achieve accurate instance separation for better morphometric analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate morphological quantification of renal pathology functional units relies on instance-level segmentation, yet existing datasets and methods provide only binary masks, limiting precision. Classical post-processing techniques have constrained effectiveness due to diverse morphologies and complex connectivity in renal tissue.

Method: DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided binary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology, integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations within a unified framework, complemented by adaptive geometric refinement and customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of functional unit. Systematic parameter optimization is used.

Conclusion: DyMorph-B2I pipeline robustly separates adherent and heterogeneous structures present in binary masks, outperforming individual classical approaches and naive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and facilitating more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows.

Abstract: Accurate morphological quantification of renal pathology functional units
relies on instance-level segmentation, yet most existing datasets and automated
methods provide only binary (semantic) masks, limiting the precision of
downstream analyses. Although classical post-processing techniques such as
watershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, are often used to
separate semantic masks into instances, their individual effectiveness is
constrained by the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity found in renal
tissue. In this study, we present DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided
binary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology. Our
approach integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations
within a unified framework, complemented by adaptive geometric refinement and
customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of functional unit. Through
systematic parameter optimization, DyMorph-B2I robustly separates adherent and
heterogeneous structures present in binary masks. Experimental results

TL;DR: STAGNet improves accident prediction from dash-cam videos using spatio-temporal features and recurrent networks, outperforming prior methods in accuracy and collision prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accident prediction and timely warnings are crucial for road safety. While many systems use various sensors, relying solely on dash-cam video offers a cost-effective and deployable solution. This work aims to improve accident prediction using only dash-cam video by leveraging advanced spatio-temporal features and recurrent networks.

Method: The paper proposes a new model called STAGNet that incorporates better spatio-temporal features and aggregates them through a recurrent network. This model aims to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural networks for accident prediction using dash-cam videos.

Result: Experiments on three public datasets show that STAGNet achieves higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values compared to previous methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in both cross-validation and cross-dataset scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed STAGNet model, which incorporates spatio-temporal features aggregated through a recurrent network, outperforms previous methods in accident prediction from dash-cam videos, achieving higher average precision and mean time-to-collision.

Abstract: Accident prediction and timely warnings play a key role in improving road
safety by reducing the risk of injury to road users and minimizing property
damage. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human
drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents
before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors
such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents
a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In
this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them
through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural
networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three
publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves
higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous
methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and
tested on different datasets.

TL;DR: TriMM 是首个前馈 3D 原生生成模型，能够从 RGB、RGBD 和点云等多种模态中学习。它通过协作式多模态编码和三平面潜在扩散模型来提高 3D 资产的纹理和几何细节。TriMM 在少量数据下实现了有竞争力的性能，并能整合新的多模态数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 3D 生成模型要么主要在单一模态中运行，忽略了多模态数据的互补优势，要么仅限于 3D 结构，限制了可用训练数据集的范围。为了全面利用多模态数据进行 3D 建模，需要一个能够从多种模态中学习的模型。

Method: TriMM 采用前馈、3D 原生生成模型，从多模态数据（RGB、RGBD 和点云）中学习。它引入了协作式多模态编码，以整合特定于模态的特征，同时保留其独特的表示优势。此外，它还利用辅助的 2D 和 3D 监督来提高多模态编码的鲁棒性和性能。基于嵌入的多模态代码，TriMM 使用三平面潜在扩散模型来生成具有卓越纹理和几何细节的 3D 资产。

Result: TriMM 在多个知名数据集上的广泛实验表明，它能有效利用多模态数据，在仅使用少量训练数据的情况下，实现了与在大规模数据集上训练的模型相媲美的性能。此外，在最近的 RGB-D 数据集上进行的额外实验验证了将其他多模态数据集纳入 3D 生成的可行性。

Conclusion: TriMM 通过有效利用多模态数据，在利用少量训练数据的情况下，实现了与在大规模数据集上训练的模型的竞争性性能。

Abstract: 3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be
projected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds).
Each modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images
contain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D
geometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either
operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the
complementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D
structures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To
holistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the
first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic
multi-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM
first introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates
modality-specific features while preserving their unique representational
strengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to
raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the
embedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to
generate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the
geometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets
demonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves
competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite
utilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional
experiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of
incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new contrastive clustering framework uses soft prototypes and dual consistency learning to address inter-class conflicts and prototype drift, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contrastive learning methods for clustering have difficulty solving the conflict problem between classes, and there is a deviation between the calculation of hard prototypes and the true cluster center.

Method: The framework consists of a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning module. The soft prototype contrastive module calculates prototypes using the probability of a sample belonging to a cluster center as weights, avoiding inter-class conflicts and reducing prototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns different transformations of the same sample and the neighborhoods of different samples to ensure feature transformation-invariant semantic information and compact intra-cluster distribution.

Result: Extensive experiments on five datasets show that the proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA.

Abstract: Contrastive learning is widely used in clustering tasks due to its
discriminative representation. However, the conflict problem between classes is
difficult to solve effectively. Existing methods try to solve this problem
through prototype contrast, but there is a deviation between the calculation of
hard prototypes and the true cluster center. To address this problem, we
propose a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework, which
consists of a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning
module. In short, the soft prototype contrastive module uses the probability
that the sample belongs to the cluster center as a weight to calculate the
prototype of each category, while avoiding inter-class conflicts and reducing
prototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns different
transformations of the same sample and the neighborhoods of different samples
respectively, ensuring that the features have transformation-invariant semantic
information and compact intra-cluster distribution, while providing reliable
guarantees for the calculation of prototypes. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that the proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA. Our
code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/CPCC.

Method: 提出了一种名为AeroDuo的双无人机协同导航框架，其中高空无人机利用多模态大语言模型（Pilot-LLM）进行目标推理，低空无人机采用轻量级多阶段策略进行导航和目标定位。

Result: 构建了一个包含13,838个协同高低空无人机演示轨迹的数据集HaL-13k，并提出了AeroDuo框架。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种名为DuAl-VLN的双无人机协同视觉与语言导航任务，旨在克服现有UAV-VLN任务中的挑战。

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an emerging task that enables
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate outdoor environments using natural
language instructions and visual cues. However, due to the extended
trajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN
performance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly
detailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which
could provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion
space for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV
Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct
altitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,
and a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training
and evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising
13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with
target-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps
and an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's
generalization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.
To consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV
collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a
multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the
low-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and
target grounding. The two UAVs work collaboratively and only exchange minimal
coordinate information to ensure efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion models are slow due to sequential generation. This paper introduces 'skipped-step sampling' which bypasses denoising steps, is compatible with the original training objective, and accelerates generation without needing non-Markovian processes. Experiments show it achieves high quality with fewer steps, and can be combined with DDIM for further improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: reducing the sequential generation process of diffusion models which requires long-sequence step-by-step generation.

Method: skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate denoising steps in the iterative generation process.

Result: skipped-step sampling can achieve high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling steps in popular pretrained diffusion models.

Conclusion:  skipped-step sampling is derived from the same training objective as the standard diffusion model, and can accelerate the sampling process in a Markovian way, which is an intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. This method can be combined with DDIM for enhanced generation quality.

Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving state-of-the-art results across various
generation tasks. However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation
process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods,
such as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of
non-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective.
However, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion
process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian
processes. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce
skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate
denoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the
traditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially,
we demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the
same training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that
accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an
intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an
enhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique
with DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models,
including the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our
method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling
steps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像编码器通常编码模式有限，且需要工程师手动选择，对非专业用户不友好。本文旨在克服这些限制，提出一种更智能、更易于使用的图像压缩方法。

Method: 本文提出了Comp-X，一个结合了LLM推理能力的智能交互式图像压缩范式。其关键创新包括：1. 多功能编码框架，统一了人类感知、变量编码和空间比特分配等多种编码模式。2. 交互式编码代理，通过增强的上下文学习和编码专家反馈来训练LLM理解编码请求和模式选择。3. IIC-bench，一个包含用户请求和专家注释的基准测试，用于评估智能交互式图像压缩。

Result: 实验结果表明，Comp-X能有效理解编码请求，具备出色的文本交互能力，并且在单一编码框架下仍能保持可比的压缩性能。

Conclusion: Comp-X是一个创新的、由LLM驱动的图像压缩范式，它通过多功能编码框架、交互式编码代理和IIC-bench基准，实现了智能交互式图像压缩，在保持可比的压缩性能的同时，大大提高了用户友好性，为AGI在图像压缩领域的应用开辟了前景。

Abstract: We present Comp-X, the first intelligently interactive image compression
paradigm empowered by the impressive reasoning capability of large language
model (LLM) agent. Notably, commonly used image codecs usually suffer from
limited coding modes and rely on manual mode selection by engineers, making
them unfriendly for unprofessional users. To overcome this, we advance the
evolution of image coding paradigm by introducing three key innovations: (i)
multi-functional coding framework, which unifies different coding modes of
various objective/requirements, including human-machine perception, variable
coding, and spatial bit allocation, into one framework. (ii) interactive coding
agent, where we propose an augmented in-context learning method with coding
expert feedback to teach the LLM agent how to understand the coding request,
mode selection, and the use of the coding tools. (iii) IIC-bench, the first
dedicated benchmark comprising diverse user requests and the corresponding
annotations from coding experts, which is systematically designed for
intelligently interactive image compression evaluation. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed Comp-X can understand the coding requests
efficiently and achieve impressive textual interaction capability. Meanwhile,
it can maintain comparable compression performance even with a single coding
framework, providing a promising avenue for artificial general intelligence
(AGI) in image compression.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in computational pathology aims to identify rare and scarce
anomalies where disease-related data are often limited or missing. Existing
anomaly detection methods, primarily designed for industrial settings, face
limitations in pathology due to computational constraints, diverse tissue
structures, and lack of interpretability. To address these challenges, we
propose Ano-NAViLa, a Normal and Abnormal pathology knowledge-augmented
Vision-Language model for Anomaly detection in pathology images. Ano-NAViLa is
built on a pre-trained vision-language model with a lightweight trainable MLP.
By incorporating both normal and abnormal pathology knowledge, Ano-NAViLa
enhances accuracy and robustness to variability in pathology images and
provides interpretability through image-text associations. Evaluated on two
lymph node datasets from different organs, Ano-NAViLa achieves the
state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection and localization,
outperforming competing models.

*Han Li,Shaofei Huang,Longfei Xu,Yulu Gao,Beipeng Mu,Si Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RATopo通过一种冗余分配策略，实现了丰富多样的拓扑监督，解决了现有方法中监督范围有限的问题，并提升了车道拓扑推理的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的车道拓扑推理方法大多采用“先检测后推理”的范式，其中拓扑关系基于检测阶段获得的一对一分配结果进行监督。然而，这种监督策略由于有效的监督范围有限，导致了次优的拓扑推理性能。

Method: 该方法重构了Transformer的解码器，通过交换交叉注意力和自注意力层，在抑制之前保留了冗余的车道预测，实现了有效的一对多分配。此外，还实例化了多个具有独立参数的并行交叉注意力块，以增强检测到的车道的数量和几何多样性。

Result: 实验结果表明，RATopo策略可以提升现有的拓扑推理框架，提升车道-车道和车道-交通拓扑性能。

Conclusion: RATopo是一种模型无关的策略，可以无缝集成到现有的车道拓扑推理框架中，并持续提高车道-车道和车道-交通拓扑性能。

Abstract: Lane topology reasoning plays a critical role in autonomous driving by
modeling the connections among lanes and the topological relationships between
lanes and traffic elements. Most existing methods adopt a
first-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are
supervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the
detection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology
reasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision. In this
paper, we propose RATopo, a Redundancy Assignment strategy for lane Topology
reasoning that enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision.
Specifically, we restructure the Transformer decoder by swapping the
cross-attention and self-attention layers. This allows redundant lane
predictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many
assignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with
independent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes.
Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology
reasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic
topology performance.

Conclusion: 多模态方法在推进专利分析方面展现出巨大潜力，DesignCLIP在专利分类和专利检索等任务中表现优于基线和SOTA模型。

Abstract: In the field of design patent analysis, traditional tasks such as patent
classification and patent image retrieval heavily depend on the image data.
However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and
structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying
comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead
to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more
reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP
models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications
with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique
characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware
classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions
for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness
of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification
and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval,
which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by
offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that
DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent
domain on all tasks. Our findings underscore the promise of multimodal
approaches in advancing patent analysis. The codebase is available here:

*Darya Taratynova,Alya Almsouti,Beknur Kalmakhanbet,Numan Saeed,Mohammad Yaqub*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TPA是一种用于胎儿先天性心脏缺陷（CHD）超声心动图视频分类的新方法，它通过整合时间信息、对比学习和不确定性量化来提高准确性和临床可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声心动图视频中先天性心脏缺陷（CHD）的检测受到图像噪声和探头定位变异性的阻碍。当前的机器学习方法常常忽略时间信息、仅限于二元分类，并且没有考虑预测校准。

Method: TPA提取视频子剪辑每一帧的特征，并使用可训练的时间提取器聚合特征以捕捉心脏运动，最后通过边距铰链对比损失将视频表示与类别特定的文本提示对齐。引入条件变分自动编码器风格调制（CVAESM）模块来提高校准以增强临床可靠性，该模块学习潜在样式向量来调制嵌入并量化分类不确定性。

Result: TPA在CHD检测的私有数据集和瓣膜性疾病的EchoNet-Dynamic公共数据集上均达到了最先进的宏观F1分数，CHD诊断的宏观F1分数为85.40%，同时将预期校准误差（ECE）降低了5.38%，自适应ECE降低了6.8%。在EchoNet-Dynamic的三分类任务上，宏观F1分数提高了4.73%（从53.89%提高到58.62%）。

Conclusion: TPA框架能够对胎儿先天性心脏缺陷（CHD）进行超声心动图视频分类，该框架整合了时间建模、提示感知对比学习和不确定性量化。

Abstract: Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by
image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can
reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect
temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not
account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA),
a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive
learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts
features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates
them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns
the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge
contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce
a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which
learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies
classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection
and on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while
also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On
EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to
58.62%). Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital
heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal
modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Real-time 3D trajectory player tracking in sports plays a crucial role in
tactical analysis, performance evaluation, and enhancing spectator experience.
Traditional systems rely on multi-camera setups, but are constrained by the
inherently two-dimensional nature of video data and the need for complex 3D
reconstruction processing, making real-time analysis challenging. Basketball,
in particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field,
as ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with
frequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.
  To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first
multimodal dataset in the sports MOT field that combines LiDAR point clouds
with synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball
environment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves
improved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR
dataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully
synchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We
recorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball
players, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for
each player. Based on this dataset, we developed a novel MOT algorithm that
leverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. The proposed method
consists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal
tracking pipeline that fuses LiDAR and camera data. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time operation, which was difficult
with conventional camera-only methods, while achieving superior tracking
performance even under occlusion conditions. The dataset is available upon

*Wutao Liu,YiDan Wang,Pan Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAG-SEG is a training-free method for camouflaged object detection that uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to create coarse masks, followed by SAM-based segmentation (SEG) for refinement. It avoids traditional training and runs efficiently on a personal laptop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for camouflaged object detection (COD) require heavy training and large computational resources. Foundation models like SAM struggle with COD without fine-tuning and high-quality prompts, which are costly and inefficient to generate manually. The proposed RAG-SEG aims to address these challenges by providing a training-free paradigm.

Method: RAG-SEG constructs a retrieval database using unsupervised clustering for fast feature retrieval. Retrieved features generate pseudo-labels that guide SAM2 for precise mask generation, effectively decoupling COD into two stages: RAG for coarse masks and SEG for refinement.

Result: RAG-SEG performs on par with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods in camouflaged object detection. All experiments were conducted on a personal laptop, demonstrating the computational efficiency and practicality of the approach.

Conclusion: Camouflaged object detection (COD) is challenging due to object-background similarity. Existing methods require heavy training and resources. Foundation models like SAM struggle with COD without fine-tuning and high-quality prompts. RAG-SEG is a training-free paradigm that decouples COD into retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for coarse masks and SAM-based segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG uses unsupervised clustering for a compact retrieval database, enabling fast feature retrieval. Retrieved features generate pseudo-labels to guide SAM2 for precise mask generation. This method avoids conventional training while achieving competitive performance. Experiments on benchmark COD datasets show RAG-SEG performs comparably or better than state-of-the-art methods. All experiments were conducted on a personal laptop, showcasing its efficiency and practicality.

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer
vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds.
Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational
resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without
fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance.
However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a
training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based
segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval
database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature
retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that
guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for
conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive
experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par
with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are
conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational
efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the
Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and
possible improvements.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoEraser是一个即插即用的框架，通过调整提示嵌入和噪声引导，有效阻止T2V模型生成包含不良内容（如个人身份、艺术风格、名人、露骨内容）的视频，且不影响视频的整体质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于文本到视频（T2V）扩散模型可能被滥用生成有害或误导性内容，以及训练数据中可能包含未经授权的个人身份、艺术创作和有害材料，导致内容不受控制的生产和分发，因此需要一种方法来防止T2V扩散模型生成包含不良概念的视频。

Method: 提出了一种名为VideoEraser的训练无关框架，采用选择性提示嵌入调整（SPEA）和对抗性鲁棒噪声引导（ARNG）两阶段流程，作为即插即用模块集成到T2V扩散模型中，以阻止生成包含不良概念的视频。

Result: VideoEraser在物体擦除、艺术风格擦除、名人擦除和露骨内容擦除等四个任务的评估中，平均将不良内容减少了46%，在有效性、完整性、保真度、鲁棒性和泛化性方面均优于现有方法，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: VideoEraser通过SPEA和ARNG两阶段方法，成功实现了对T2V扩散模型生成内容的控制，有效解决了隐私、版权和安全问题，并在各项评估中表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models has raised concerns
about privacy, copyright, and safety due to their potential misuse in
generating harmful or misleading content. These models are often trained on
numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic
creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and
distribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a
training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating
videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those
concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly
integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process:
Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise
Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including
object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content
erasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms
prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and
generalizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in
suppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on
average across four tasks compared to baselines.

Abstract: The world is constantly moving towards AI based systems and autonomous
vehicles are now reality in different parts of the world. These vehicles
require sensors and cameras to detect objects and maneuver according to that.
It becomes important to for such vehicles to also predict from a distant if a
person is about to cross a road or not. The current study focused on predicting
the intent of crossing the road by pedestrians in an experimental setup. The
study involved working with deep learning models to predict poses and sequence
modelling for temporal predictions. The study analysed three different sequence
modelling to understand the prediction behaviour and it was found out that GRU
was better in predicting the intent compared to LSTM model but 1D CNN was the
best model in terms of speed. The study involved video analysis, and the output
of pose detection model was integrated later on to sequence modelling
techniques for an end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting road
crossing intents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究通过注意力冲突技术，系统地分析了视频大语言模型（Video-LLMs）的内部工作机制。研究发现，视频信息提取主要在早期层，存在两阶段过程；中间层起关键作用；模型依赖语言检索而非自注意力进行时空建模。这些发现可用于优化模型效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注 Video-LLMs 的性能提升，但对其内部机制的理解有限，本研究旨在通过系统的实证研究来弥合这一差距。

Method: 通过采用注意力冲突（attention knockouts）作为主要的分析工具，并设计了三种变体：视频时间冲突、视频空间冲突和语言到视频冲突。在控制层数窗口和冲突类型的基础上，本研究设置了全局和细粒度两种场景，以解释现有的 Video-LLMs。

Result: 1. 全局场景表明，视频信息提取主要在早期层进行，形成一个清晰的两阶段过程：低层关注感知编码，高层处理抽象推理。 2. 在细粒度场景下，某些中间层对视频问答产生的影响尤为显著，起到了关键的“异常值”作用，而大多数其他层贡献甚微。 3. 在这两种场景下，研究都观察到，尽管帧内和帧间自注意力计算成本高昂，但空间-时间建模在很大程度上依赖于语言引导的检索，而非自注意力。

Conclusion: 本研究首次系统地揭示了视频大语言模型（Video-LLMs）内部处理和理解视频内容的方式，为未来的研究提供了可解释性和效率视角。研究结果可用于减少 Video-LLMs 的注意力计算。

Abstract: Taking advantage of large-scale data and pretrained language models, Video
Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in answering
video questions. However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance,
with limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper
aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret
existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool
and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and
Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different
numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of
layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a
fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting
indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers,
forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding,
while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting,
certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question
answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute
minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling
relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame
self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational
cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce
attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work
to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand
video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future
research.

Conclusion: BioTune通过选择性地微调层来提高迁移学习的效率，在准确性和效率方面与其他微调方法相当或更优。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown substantial progress in image analysis. However, the
computational demands of large, fully trained models remain a consideration.
Transfer learning offers a strategy for adapting pre-trained models to new
tasks. Traditional fine-tuning often involves updating all model parameters,
which can potentially lead to overfitting and higher computational costs. This
paper introduces BioTune, an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that
selectively fine-tunes layers to enhance transfer learning efficiency. BioTune
employs an evolutionary algorithm to identify a focused set of layers for
fine-tuning, aiming to optimize model performance on a given target task.
Evaluation across nine image classification datasets from various domains
indicates that BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency
compared to existing fine-tuning methods such as AutoRGN and LoRA. By
concentrating the fine-tuning process on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune
reduces the number of trainable parameters, potentially leading to decreased
computational cost and facilitating more efficient transfer learning across
diverse data characteristics and distributions.

TL;DR: DriveSplat通过动态-静态解耦、区域性初始化、可变形神经高斯和几何先验，改进了驾驶场景的3D重建，解决了现有方法的局限性，在新视角合成方面表现优异。


<details>

Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅方法在处理驾驶场景中的运动模糊问题时，虽然能解耦动态和静态组件，但忽略了背景的几何优化，并且仅通过添加高斯来拟合训练视图，导致在渲染新视角时鲁棒性有限且几何表示不准确。

Method: DriveSplat提出了一种基于神经高斯表示的动态-静态解耦方法，通过区域性体素初始化方案（近、中、远区域划分）来处理驾驶视角下的线性运动模式，并使用可变形神经高斯来建模非刚性动态演员，同时利用来自预训练模型的深度和法线先验来提高几何结构的准确性。

Conclusion: DriveSplat通过解耦动态和静态组件、采用区域性体素初始化方案、引入可变形神经高斯以及融合深度和法线先验，在Waymo和KITTI数据集上展示了在驾驶场景新视角合成方面的最先进性能。

Abstract: In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles,
pedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant
challenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static
components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook
background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on
fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit
limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric
representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a
high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural
Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate
the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise
voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near,
middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation.
Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors,
whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network.
The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from
pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method
has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在抽象推理方面存在瓶颈，RPM问题被用作评估抽象推理能力的基准，旨在提升机器的抽象推理能力。

Method: 该研究首先采用“因果链建模”方法分析RPM任务中的因果链，并基于此设计了基线模型DIO。随后，为了解决DIO模型未能真正获取预设推理逻辑的问题，提出了三种改进方法。

Result: 实验表明，DIO模型的优化目标（最大化上下文与正确选项之间的互信息变分下界）未能使模型真正掌握推理逻辑，这归因于下界的紧密度影响互信息最大化效果以及互信息作为统计量未能捕捉因果关系。

evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms,
with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning,
pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers
on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract
reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a
``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete
causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes
$\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency
$\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture
of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the
optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational
lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option,
fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning
logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound
significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and
mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal
relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this
paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:

TL;DR: The SpiVG network, using SNNs and graph reasoning, improves video summarization by capturing temporal dependencies and semantic coherence while reducing noise and computational cost, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video summarization methods struggle to capture global temporal dependencies and maintain semantic coherence, and are also influenced by noise during multi-channel feature fusion. The proposed SpiVG network aims to enhance information density and reduce computational complexity to address these issues.

Method: The paper proposes a Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG) Network, which includes a keyframe extractor based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) that leverages event-driven computation to learn keyframe features autonomously. It also introduces a Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner for fine-grained and adaptable reasoning across video frames, decoupling object consistency from semantic coherence. A Variational Inference Reconstruction Module using Evidence Lower Bound Optimization (ELBO) is employed to address uncertainty and noise during multi-channel feature fusion by capturing latent structures and using posterior distribution regularization to reduce overfitting.

Result: Experimental results show that SpiVG surpasses existing methods across multiple datasets such as SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS.

Conclusion: SpiVG surpasses existing methods across multiple datasets such as SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS.

Abstract: With the rise of short video content, efficient video summarization
techniques for extracting key information have become crucial. However,
existing methods struggle to capture the global temporal dependencies and
maintain the semantic coherence of video content. Additionally, these methods
are also influenced by noise during multi-channel feature fusion. We propose a
Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG) Network, which enhances information density
and reduces computational complexity. First, we design a keyframe extractor
based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), leveraging the event-driven computation
mechanism of SNNs to learn keyframe features autonomously. To enable
fine-grained and adaptable reasoning across video frames, we introduce a
Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner, which decouples contextual object
consistency from semantic perspective coherence. We present a Variational
Inference Reconstruction Module to address uncertainty and noise arising during
multi-channel feature fusion. In this module, we employ Evidence Lower Bound
Optimization (ELBO) to capture the latent structure of multi-channel feature
distributions, using posterior distribution regularization to reduce
overfitting. Experimental results show that SpiVG surpasses existing methods
across multiple datasets such as SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS. Our codes

*Anthony Bisulco,Rahul Ramesh,Randall Balestriero,Pratik Chaudhari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAE hyperparameters like masking ratio and patch size affect how the model learns spatial correlations in images. This study provides analytical insights and practical guidance for selecting these hyperparameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the effectiveness of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) in vision foundation models, there's a lack of understanding regarding the connection between MAE hyperparameters and downstream task performance, necessitating an investigation into how MAEs learn spatial correlations.

Method: The study analytically derives the features learned by a linear MAE to understand the impact of masking ratio and patch size on capturing spatial correlations. This analysis is extended to non-linear MAEs to observe how representations adapt to dataset-specific spatial correlations.

Result: The analysis shows that masking ratio and patch size can be tuned to select features capturing short- and long-range spatial correlations. For non-linear MAEs, representations adapt to spatial correlations present in the dataset, going beyond simple second-order statistics.

Conclusion: The paper investigates how MAE hyperparameters (masking ratio, patch size) influence the learning of spatial correlations, offering insights into practical hyperparameter selection for novel datasets.

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful pretraining technique
for vision foundation models. Despite their effectiveness, they require
extensive hyperparameter tuning (masking ratio, patch size, encoder/decoder
layers) when applied to novel datasets. While prior theoretical works have
analyzed MAEs in terms of their attention patterns and hierarchical latent
variable models, the connection between MAE hyperparameters and performance on
downstream tasks is relatively unexplored. This work investigates how MAEs
learn spatial correlations in the input image. We analytically derive the
features learned by a linear MAE and show that masking ratio and patch size can
be used to select for features that capture short- and long-range spatial
correlations. We extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to show that MAE
representations adapt to spatial correlations in the dataset, beyond
second-order statistics. Finally, we discuss some insights on how to select MAE
hyper-parameters in practice.

TL;DR: BIRD方法通过双向时序信息传播，融合局部和全局时序信息，优化了红外小目标检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的多帧方法在检测当前帧时，主要以滑动窗口的方式聚合相邻帧的信息。然而，这种方法忽略了滑动窗口之外的全局时序信息，导致计算冗余且性能不佳。

Method: 本文提出了一种双向时序信息传播方法（BIRD），通过设计局部时序运动融合（LTMF）模块和全局时序运动融合（GTMF）模块来整合局部和全局时序信息。最后，将双向聚合特征融合后输入检测头进行检测。此外，通过引入时空融合（STF）损失与传统检测损失共同优化整个视频片段。

Result: BIRD方法在检测性能上达到了最先进的水平，并且推理速度快。

Conclusion: BIRD方法在不牺牲推理速度的情况下，在检测性能上达到了最先进的水平。

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search
and track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent
years. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the
information of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the
detection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do
not consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global
temporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant
computation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
Bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small
target Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy
simultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and
global temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.
Specifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design
a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal
dependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global
Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the
global propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the
bidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head
for detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the
traditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)
loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only
achieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference
speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统汽车损伤检查方法劳动强度大、效率低且容易忽略微小表面缺陷（如微小凹痕）的问题，提出一种基于深度学习的自动化检测方法。

Method: 使用YOLOv8目标识别框架，并针对其进行了定制化改进（YOLOv8m-t4 和 YOLOv8m-t42），同时利用实时数据增强技术进行训练，以实现对汽车表面微小划痕（特别是微小凹痕）的自动检测。

Result: YOLOv8m-t42模型在检测微小表面缺陷方面展现出高检测精度和低推理延迟，其性能优于YOLOv8m-t4模型，适用于实时自动化保险评估和汽车检查等应用。

Conclusion: YOLOv8m-t42模型在识别微小表面缺陷方面表现优于YOLOv8m-t4模型，精度为0.86，召回率为0.84，F1分数为0.85，PR曲线下面积为0.88，表明其在实际应用中具有更高的准确性和更一致的性能。

Abstract: Conventional car damage inspection techniques are labor-intensive, manual,
and frequently overlook tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents.
Machine learning provides an innovative solution to the increasing demand for
quicker and more precise inspection methods. The paper uses the YOLOv8 object
recognition framework to provide a deep learning-based solution for
automatically detecting microscopic surface flaws, notably tiny dents, on car
exteriors. Traditional automotive damage inspection procedures are manual,
time-consuming, and frequently unreliable at detecting tiny flaws. To solve
this, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under
various lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created. To improve
robustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and
YOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches.
Experimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy
and low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as
automated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. Evaluation
parameters such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and
F1-score verified the model's efficacy. With a precision of 0.86, recall of
0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4
model (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying
microscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the
mAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve
area was 0.88, suggesting more consistent performance than YOLOv8m-t4 (0.82).
YOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent
detection applications, even though its convergence is slower.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脸部侦测是许多人工智能应用（如监控、生物识别认证和人机交互）的关键组成部分。然而，低分辨率图像等现实条件会严重影响脸部侦测的性能，因此有必要研究输入分辨率对脸部侦测模型准确性和鲁棒性的影响。

Method: 本研究采用系统性方法，在WIDER FACE数据集上，对YOLOv11、YOLOv12和MTCNN这三种主流的基于深度学习的人脸检测器，在160x160、320x320和640x640等多个图像分辨率下进行了广泛的评估。评估指标包括准确率、召回率、mAP50、mAP50-95以及推断时间。

Result: 在准确性方面，YOLOv11优于YOLOv12和MTCNN，尤其是在较高分辨率下。YOLOv12的召回率略高于其他模型。MTCNN在面部特征点定位上表现良好，但其推断速度相对较慢。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，在所测试的脸部侦测模型中，YOLOv11在准确性方面表现最佳，尤其是在较高分辨率下，而YOLOv12在召回率方面略优。MTCNN虽然在面部特征点定位方面具有竞争力，但在实时推断速度方面表现不佳。这些发现为在不同操作限制下选择适合分辨率的脸部侦测模型提供了可行的见解。

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

TL;DR: MATR是一个用于视频到视频时刻检索的Transformer模型，通过双阶段序列对齐和自监督预训练来提高性能，并在两个数据集上取得了显著的成果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频到视频的时刻检索（Vid2VidMR）任务旨在通过查询视频来定位目标视频中未见过的事件或时刻，该任务面临语义帧级对齐和建模查询视频与目标视频之间复杂依赖关系的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种名为MATR（Moment Alignment Transformer）的基于Transformer的模型，该模型通过双阶段序列对齐来捕捉查询视频和目标视频之间的相关性和依赖性，并结合了自监督预训练技术。

Result: MATR在ActivityNet-VRL数据集上取得了13.1%的R@1和8.1%的mIoU的提升；在SportsMoments数据集上取得了14.7%的R@1和14.4%的mIoU的提升。

Conclusion: MATR在ActivityNet-VRL和SportsMoments数据集上均取得了显著的性能提升，分别在R@1和mIoU上比现有方法有13.1%和8.1%的绝对提升。

Abstract: Video-to-video moment retrieval (Vid2VidMR) is the task of localizing unseen
events or moments in a target video using a query video. This task poses
several challenges, such as the need for semantic frame-level alignment and
modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos. To tackle this
challenging problem, we introduce MATR (Moment Alignment TRansformer), a
transformer-based model designed to capture semantic context as well as the
temporal details necessary for precise moment localization. MATR conditions
target video representations on query video features using dual-stage sequence
alignment that encodes the required correlations and dependencies. These
representations are then used to guide foreground/background classification and
boundary prediction heads, enabling the model to accurately identify moments in
the target video that semantically match with the query video. Additionally, to
provide a strong task-specific initialization for MATR, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training technique that involves training the model to
localize random clips within videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MATR achieves notable performance improvements of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU
on an absolute scale compared to state-of-the-art methods on the popular
ActivityNet-VRL dataset. Additionally, on our newly proposed dataset,
SportsMoments, MATR shows a 14.7% gain in R@1 and a 14.4% gain in mIoU on an
absolute scale over strong baselines.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新颖的3DGS方法，通过密集立体模块和相干视图插值模块，解决了在极稀疏视图下SfM失效的问题，实现了从稀疏输入到高质量新颖视图合成的跨越，并在PSNR上取得了显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS在实时新颖视图合成方面表现出色，但其有效性严重依赖于密集的多视图输入和精确已知的相机位姿，而这在实际场景中很少能获得。当输入视图变得极其稀疏时，3DGS所依赖的SfM方法在初始化时会因无法准确重建场景的3D几何结构而导致渲染质量下降。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的无SfM（Structure-from-Motion）的3DGS（3D Gaussian Splatting）方法，该方法从极稀疏的视图输入中联合估计相机位姿并重建3D场景。具体来说，我们提出了一种密集立体模块来逐步估计相机位姿信息，并为初始化重建全局密集点云。为了解决极稀疏视图设置中信息稀缺的问题，我们提出了一种相干视图插值模块，该模块基于训练视图对插值相机位姿，并生成视点一致的内容作为训练的附加监督信号。此外，我们引入了多尺度拉普拉斯一致性正则化和自适应空间感知多尺度几何正则化来增强几何结构和渲染内容的质量。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在极稀疏视图条件下显著优于其他基于3DGS的方法，在仅使用2个训练视图的情况下，PSNR提升了2.75dB。所合成的图像失真度极小，同时保留了丰富的高频细节，与现有技术相比具有卓越的视觉质量。

Conclusion: 该方法在极稀疏视图条件下显著优于其他基于3DGS的方法，在仅使用2个训练视图的情况下，PSNR提升了2.75dB。所合成的图像失真度极小，同时保留了丰富的高频细节，与现有技术相比具有卓越的视觉质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable real-time
performance in novel view synthesis, yet its effectiveness relies heavily on
dense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which are rarely
available in real-world scenarios. When input views become extremely sparse,
the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization
fails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes,
resulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
SfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs
3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we
propose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose
information and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To
address the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view
settings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates
camera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent
content as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we
introduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive
spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of
geometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method
significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches,
achieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view
conditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method
exhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details,
resulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的轻量级模型通常以牺牲性能为代价来提高效率，并且很少采用计算成本高昂的注意力机制，严重限制了它们的全局上下文感知能力。此外，当前的架构忽略了医学成像中同一卷积核下的通道冗余问题，这阻碍了有效的特征提取。

Method: LGMSNet 采用异构层内核提取局部高频信息，同时减轻通道冗余。此外，该模型集成了稀疏 Transformer-卷积混合分支来捕获低频全局信息。

Result: LGMSNet 取得了最先进的性能，计算开销极小。在一项针对六个公共数据集的广泛实验中，LGMSNet 的性能优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: LGMSNet 在零样本泛化测试中在四个未见过的数据集上保持了卓越的性能，凸显了其在资源有限的医疗场景中实际部署的潜力。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings
where lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However,
existing lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and
rarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely
restricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally,
current architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same
convolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature
extraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel
lightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves
state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet
employs heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency
information while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model
integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture
low-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public
datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art
methods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot
generalization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for
real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios. The whole project

Motivation: To extend the capabilities of single-view reconstruction methods to leverage multiple viewpoints for improved geometry and body pose estimation in clothed human avatars.

Method: MExECON is a novel pipeline for 3D reconstruction of clothed human avatars from sparse multi-view RGB images. It utilizes a Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO) algorithm to fit a single SMPL-X body model jointly across all input views, enforcing multi-view consistency.

guides the subsequent surface reconstruction, where geometric details are added
via normal map integration. MExECON integrates normal maps from both front and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决当前多模态图像融合（MMIF）方法在模态失配、高频细节破坏和任务特定限制等方面的挑战，提出AdaSFFuse框架以实现任务泛化的MMIF。

Method: 提出了一种名为AdaSFFuse的新型框架，该框架通过自适应跨域协同融合学习来实现任务泛化多模态图像融合。AdaSFFuse引入了两种关键创新：用于频率解耦的自适应近似小波变换（AdaWAT），以及用于高效多模态融合的空频Mamba块。AdaWAT能够自适应地分离不同场景下多模态图像的高低频分量，实现对每个模态不同频率特性的细粒度提取和对齐。空频Mamba块则在空间域和频率域促进跨域融合，并通过可学习映射动态调整，确保在不同模态之间实现鲁棒融合。

Result: AdaSFFuse通过结合AdaWAT和空频Mamba块，能够改善多模态特征的对齐与融合，减少频率损失，并保留关键细节。

Conclusion: AdaSFFuse在红外-可见光图像融合（IVF）、多焦点图像融合（MFF）、多曝光图像融合（MEF）和医学图像融合（MIF）这四项多模态图像融合任务上展现出优越的融合性能，实现了低计算成本和紧凑网络，在性能和效率之间取得了良好的平衡。

Abstract: Multimodal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary information
from different imaging modalities to overcome the limitations of individual
sensors. It enhances image quality and facilitates downstream applications such
as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements, current MMIF methods still face challenges such as modality
misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for
task-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning.
AdaSFFuse introduces two key innovations: the Adaptive Approximate Wavelet
Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and the Spatial-Frequency Mamba
Blocks for efficient multimodal fusion. AdaWAT adaptively separates the high-
and low-frequency components of multimodal images from different scenes,
enabling fine-grained extraction and alignment of distinct frequency
characteristics for each modality. The Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks
facilitate cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing
this process. These blocks dynamically adjust through learnable mappings to
ensure robust fusion across diverse modalities. By combining these components,
AdaSFFuse improves the alignment and integration of multimodal features,
reduces frequency loss, and preserves critical details. Extensive experiments
on four MMIF tasks -- Infrared-Visible Image Fusion (IVF), Multi-Focus Image
Fusion (MFF), Multi-Exposure Image Fusion (MEF), and Medical Image Fusion (MIF)
-- demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superior fusion performance, ensuring both low
computational cost and a compact network, offering a strong balance between
performance and efficiency. The code will be publicly available at

Motivation: 从记录的驾驶日志中合成外推视图对于模拟自动驾驶汽车的驾驶场景至关重要，但这仍然是一项挑战性任务。现有方法利用生成先验作为伪真实性，但经常导致几何一致性差和渲染过于平滑。

Method: ExtraGS 框架的核心是一种新颖的基于混合高斯符号距离函数 (SDF) 设计的路面高斯 (RSG) 表示，以及使用可学习缩放因子来有效处理远处物体的前场高斯 (FFG)。此外，我们还开发了一个基于球谐函数的自监督不确定性估计框架，该框架能够仅在发生外推伪影的地方选择性地整合生成先验。

Result: 实验证明 ExtraGS 在真实感和几何一致性方面表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ExtraGS 显著提高了外推视图的真实感和几何一致性，同时保持了原始轨迹的高保真度。

Abstract: Synthesizing extrapolated views from recorded driving logs is critical for
simulating driving scenes for autonomous driving vehicles, yet it remains a
challenging task. Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground
truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed
renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic
framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and
generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG)
representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF)
design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to
efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised
uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables
selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts
occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups,
and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances
the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving
high fidelity along the original trajectory.

TL;DR: GroupSketch 是一种新的矢量草图动画方法，可以处理多对象交互和复杂运动，并通过其两阶段方法和 GDN 改进了时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理多对象交互和复杂运动的矢量草图动画时存在局限性，容易出现时间不一致和泛化能力差的问题。

Method: GroupSketch 采用包括运动初始化和运动细化的两阶段方法。第一阶段通过插值生成粗糙动画，第二阶段提出基于组的位移网络（GDN）来优化动画，该网络利用文本到视频模型的先验知识，并通过上下文条件特征增强（CCFE）等模块来提高时间一致性。

Result: GroupSketch 在生成高质量、时间一致的多对象复杂动画方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GroupSketch 在生成高质量、时间一致的多对象复杂动画方面显著优于现有方法，扩展了动画的实际应用。

Abstract: We introduce GroupSketch, a novel method for vector sketch animation that
effectively handles multi-object interactions and complex motions. Existing
approaches struggle with these scenarios, either being limited to single-object
cases or suffering from temporal inconsistency and poor generalization. To
address these limitations, our method adopts a two-stage pipeline comprising
Motion Initialization and Motion Refinement. In the first stage, the input
sketch is interactively divided into semantic groups and key frames are
defined, enabling the generation of a coarse animation via interpolation. In
the second stage, we propose a Group-based Displacement Network (GDN), which
refines the coarse animation by predicting group-specific displacement fields,
leveraging priors from a text-to-video model. GDN further incorporates
specialized modules, such as Context-conditioned Feature Enhancement (CCFE), to
improve temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality,
temporally consistent animations for complex, multi-object sketches, thus
expanding the practical applications of sketch animation.

*Chang Liu,Yang Xu,Tamas Sziranyi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D3FNet通过结合差分注意扩张提取、双流解码融合和多尺度扩张策略，提高了遥感图像中狭窄道路分割的准确性和连续性，克服了传统方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提取高分辨率遥感图像中的狭窄道路仍然是一个重大挑战，原因是其宽度有限、拓扑结构零碎且经常被遮挡。

Method: D3FNet是一个基于D-LinkNet的编码器-解码器骨干的密集预测模型，它引入了差分注意扩张提取（DADE）模块、双流解码融合机制（DDFM）以及多尺度扩张策略（扩张率1、3、5、9），以解决细粒度道路分割的挑战。

Result: D3FNet在DeepGlobe和CHN6-CUG基准测试中取得了优于最先进方法的性能，在具有挑战性的道路区域实现了更高的IoU和召回率。

Conclusion: D3FNet在DeepGlobe和CHN6-CUG基准测试中表现出色，在具有挑战性的道路区域实现了优越的IoU和召回率，优于最先进的基线。消融研究进一步证实了注意力引导编码和双路径解码的互补协同作用。这些结果证实D3FNet是复杂远程和协同感知场景中细粒度狭窄道路提取的稳健解决方案。

Abstract: Extracting narrow roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery remains a
significant challenge due to their limited width, fragmented topology, and
frequent occlusions. To address these issues, we propose D3FNet, a Dilated
Dual-Stream Differential Attention Fusion Network designed for fine-grained
road structure segmentation in remote perception systems. Built upon the
encoder-decoder backbone of D-LinkNet, D3FNet introduces three key
innovations:(1) a Differential Attention Dilation Extraction (DADE) module that
enhances subtle road features while suppressing background noise at the
bottleneck; (2) a Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism (DDFM) that integrates
original and attention-modulated features to balance spatial precision with
semantic context; and (3) a multi-scale dilation strategy (rates 1, 3, 5, 9)
that mitigates gridding artifacts and improves continuity in narrow road
prediction. Unlike conventional models that overfit to generic road widths,
D3FNet specifically targets fine-grained, occluded, and low-contrast road
segments. Extensive experiments on the DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks show
that D3FNet achieves superior IoU and recall on challenging road regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies further verify the
complementary synergy of attention-guided encoding and dual-path decoding.
These results confirm D3FNet as a robust solution for fine-grained narrow road
extraction in complex remote and cooperative perception scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADAPT是一种新的测试时自适应（TTA）方法，它使用高斯概率推理和无梯度更新来提高鲁棒性，同时保持可扩展性和实时部署能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的TTA方法依赖于反向传播或迭代优化，这限制了其可扩展性和实时部署。此外，它们缺乏对类别条件特征分布的显式建模，这对于产生可靠的决策边界和校准的预测至关重要，但由于在测试时缺乏源数据和监督而探索不足。

Method: ADAPT通过将TTA重构为高斯概率推理任务，并使用逐渐更新的类别均值和共享协方差矩阵对类别条件似然进行建模，从而实现了无训练的推理。通过CLIP先验和历史知识库引导的轻量级正则化来纠正潜在的似然偏差。ADAPT不需要源数据、梯度更新或目标数据的全部访问权限，支持在线和传导模式。

Result: ADAPT是一种先进的、无反向传播的、面向分布的测试时自适应方法。

Conclusion: ADAPT在广泛的分布变化下实现了最先进的性能，具有出色的可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under
distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite
notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability.
First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which
limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit
modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial
for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it
remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at
test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and
backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian
probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using
gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables
closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we
introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical
knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full
access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings.
Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts
with superior scalability and robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新颖的两阶段训练策略，利用邻域感知软掩码来解决INR的光谱偏差问题，并提高了图像重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经表示（INR）中存在的频谱偏差问题，即神经网络倾向于学习低频分量而难以捕捉高频细节。

Method: 提出了一种两阶段训练策略，包括一个邻域感知软掩码，该掩码能够自适应地将更高的权重分配给具有强局部变化的像素，随后进行全图像训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能够持续改进重建质量，并且能够作为现有INR方法的补充。

Conclusion: 该方法通过引入邻域感知软掩码，将更高权重分配给具有强局部变化的像素，以解决INR的光谱偏差问题，并在图像重建方面取得了持续的改进，可以与现有的INR方法互补。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful alternative
to traditional pixel-based formats by modeling images as continuous functions
over spatial coordinates. A key challenge, however, lies in the spectral bias
of neural networks, which tend to favor low-frequency components while
struggling to capture high-frequency (HF) details such as sharp edges and fine
textures. While prior approaches have addressed this limitation through
architectural modifications or specialized activation functions, we propose an
orthogonal direction by directly guiding the training process. Specifically, we
introduce a two-stage training strategy where a neighbor-aware soft mask
adaptively assigns higher weights to pixels with strong local variations,
encouraging early focus on fine details. The model then transitions to
full-image training. Experimental results show that our approach consistently
improves reconstruction quality and complements existing INR methods. As a
pioneering attempt to assign frequency-aware importance to pixels in image INR,
our work offers a new avenue for mitigating the spectral bias problem.

TL;DR: 一种新的线性时间凸松弛和收缩器方法，可将 TLS 点云配准速度提高两个数量级，并确保全局最优性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决截断最小二乘（TLS）配准问题具有组合优化性质，现有全局最优方法（如半定规划（SDP））速度较慢，需要几百秒才能处理 100 个点。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的线性时间凸松弛和收缩器方法，以加速分支定界（BnB）。

Result: 该求解器比最先进的 SDP 求解器 STRIDE 快两个数量级，并提供了全局最优性的正式证明和经验证据。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新颖的线性时间凸松弛和收缩器方法，以在提供旋转轴的情况下，在不到半秒的时间内以可证明的全局最优性注册两个具有 100 个点的 3D 点云。

Abstract: Recent results showed that point cloud registration with given
correspondences can be made robust to outlier rates of up to 95\% using the
truncated least squares (TLS) formulation. However, solving this combinatorial
optimization problem to global optimality is challenging. Provably globally
optimal approaches using semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations take
hundreds of seconds for 100 points. In this paper, we propose a novel linear
time convex relaxation as well as a contractor method to speed up Branch and
Bound (BnB). Our solver can register two 3D point clouds with 100 points to
provable global optimality in less than half a second when the axis of rotation
is provided. Although it currently cannot solve the full 6DoF problem, it is
two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art SDP solver STRIDE when
solving the rotation-only TLS problem. In addition to providing a formal proof
for global optimality, we present empirical evidence of global optimality using
adversarial instances with local minimas close to the global minimum.

TL;DR: 该研究通过结合相机陷阱和无人机热成像，利用深度学习技术，成功识别了尼泊尔奇特旺国家公园内人兽活动的热点区域和冲突区域，并验证了 YOLOv11s 模型在图像检测上的优越性，最终提出该方法能有效提升野生动物监测和景观管理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解野生动物和人类活动的空间分布对于评估人兽互动和制定有效的保护规划至关重要。

Method: 通过结合相机陷阱和无人机（可见光、近红外和热红外）影像，利用深度学习模型（如 YOLOv11s 和 Faster RCNN）自动识别野生动物和人类活动。对收集的影像数据进行处理，构建训练和测试数据集，并进行空间模式分析，以识别活动热点和潜在人兽冲突区域。

Result: 研究在奇特旺国家公园（CNP）及其周边地区进行了实证分析。结果显示，YOLOv11s 模型在相机陷阱图像检测方面表现最佳（精确率 96.2%，召回率 92.3%，mAP50 96.7%）。无人机热成像结合 Faster RCNN 模型提供了补充的空中视角。空间模式分析识别出了野生动物和人类活动的明确热点区域及其重叠模式，指出了潜在的人兽冲突区域。

Abstract: Wildlife and human activities are key components of landscape systems.
Understanding their spatial distribution is essential for evaluating human
wildlife interactions and informing effective conservation planning.
Multiperspective monitoring of wildlife and human activities by combining
camera traps and drone imagery. Capturing the spatial patterns of their
distributions, which allows the identification of the overlap of their activity
zones and the assessment of the degree of human wildlife conflict. The study
was conducted in Chitwan National Park (CNP), Nepal, and adjacent regions.
Images collected by visible and nearinfrared camera traps and thermal infrared
drones from February to July 2022 were processed to create training and testing
datasets, which were used to build deep learning models to automatic identify
wildlife and human activities. Drone collected thermal imagery was used for
detecting targets to provide a multiple monitoring perspective. Spatial pattern
analysis was performed to identify animal and resident activity hotspots and
delineation potential human wildlife conflict zones. Among the deep learning
models tested, YOLOv11s achieved the highest performance with a precision of
96.2%, recall of 92.3%, mAP50 of 96.7%, and mAP50 of 81.3%, making it the most
effective for detecting objects in camera trap imagery. Drone based thermal
imagery, analyzed with an enhanced Faster RCNN model, added a complementary
aerial viewpoint for camera trap detections. Spatial pattern analysis
identified clear hotspots for both wildlife and human activities and their
overlapping patterns within certain areas in the CNP and buffer zones
indicating potential conflict. This study reveals human wildlife conflicts
within the conserved landscape. Integrating multiperspective monitoring with
automated object detection enhances wildlife surveillance and landscape
management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视频语言模型（Video LLM）在时间感知方面的局限性，例如隐式时间戳编码、帧级特征连续性捕捉弱以及语言视觉对齐漂移等问题。

Method: Grounded VideoDiT 引入了三种关键创新：1. 扩散时间潜在（DTL）编码器增强边界敏感性和时间一致性。2. 对象接地表示将查询实体显式绑定到局部视觉证据。3. 混合令牌方案（包含离散时间令牌）提供显式时间戳建模，实现细粒度时间推理。

Result: Grounded VideoDiT 具有强大的时序定位能力，并在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的成果。

Conclusion: Grounded VideoDiT 在 Charades STA、NExT GQA 和多个 VideoQA 基准测试中取得了最先进的成果。

Abstract: Understanding videos requires more than answering open ended questions, it
demands the ability to pinpoint when events occur and how entities interact
across time. While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in
holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are
encoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity,
and language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In
this paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome
these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion
Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains
temporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind
query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a
mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp
modeling, enabling fine grained temporal reasoning. Together, these designs
equip Grounded VideoDiT with robust grounding capabilities, as validated by
state of the art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 通过人工质量评分和评分模型反馈来微调分割模型，提高了树木实例分割的准确性，但对于稀疏林区或复杂环境中的小型树木，性能会下降。

Motivation: 由于传感器分辨率、植被状态、地形特征等因素导致数据变化，以及获取足够的精确标注数据来训练全监督实例分割方法成本高昂，因此在航空激光扫描（ALS）数据中进行树木实例分割仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 提出了一种弱监督方法，使用人工操作员对初始分割结果进行质量评分，然后用这些标签训练一个评分模型，该模型将分割输出分类到由人类操作员指定的相同类别。最后，利用评分模型的反馈来微调分割模型。

Result: 提出的方法在正确识别的树木实例方面提高了34%，同时显著减少了非树木实例的预测数量。

Conclusion: 提出的弱监督方法通过人工评估的质量评分来训练评分模型，并利用评分模型的反馈来微调分割模型，在正确识别的树木实例方面提高了34%，同时显著减少了非树木实例的预测数量。然而，在树木高度低于两米或存在灌木、岩石等可能被误认为是树木的复杂环境等稀疏林区，该方法的性能会降低。

Abstract: Tree instance segmentation of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is of utmost
importance for forest monitoring, but remains challenging due to variations in
the data caused by factors such as sensor resolution, vegetation state at
acquisition time, terrain characteristics, etc. Moreover, obtaining a
sufficient amount of precisely labeled data to train fully supervised instance
segmentation methods is expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a
weakly supervised approach where labels of an initial segmentation result
obtained either by a non-finetuned model or a closed form algorithm are
provided as a quality rating by a human operator. The labels produced during
the quality assessment are then used to train a rating model, whose task is to
classify a segmentation output into the same classes as specified by the human
operator. Finally, the segmentation model is finetuned using feedback from the
rating model. This in turn improves the original segmentation model by 34\% in
terms of correctly identified tree instances while considerably reducing the
number of non-tree instances predicted. Challenges still remain in data over
sparsely forested regions characterized by small trees (less than two meters in
height) or within complex surroundings containing shrubs, boulders, etc. which
can be confused as trees where the performance of the proposed method is
reduced.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep neural networks for 3D point clouds are vulnerable to adversarial examples. This paper proposes CFG, a novel transfer-based black-box attack method that improves the transferability of adversarial point clouds by guiding the corruption of critical features. CFG also constrains the deviation of adversarial point clouds to ensure imperceptibility. Experiments show that CFG outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous 3D adversarial attack methods often exploit certain information about the target models, such as model parameters or outputs, to generate adversarial point clouds. However, in realistic scenarios, it is challenging to obtain any information about the target models under conditions of absolute security. Therefore, we focus on transfer-based attacks, where generating adversarial point clouds does not require any information about the target models.

Method: CFG, a novel transfer-based black-box attack method that improves the transferability of adversarial point clouds via the proposed Critical Feature Guidance. CFG regularizes the search of adversarial point clouds by computing the importance of the extracted features, prioritizing the corruption of critical features that are likely to be adopted by diverse architectures. Further, it explicitly constrains the maximum deviation extent of the generated adversarial point clouds in the loss function to ensure their imperceptibility.

Result: Extensive experiments conducted on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed CFG outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin.

Conclusion: CFG outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin.

Abstract: Online HD map construction is a fundamental task in autonomous driving
systems, aiming to acquire semantic information of map elements around the ego
vehicle based on real-time sensor inputs. Recently, several approaches have
achieved promising results by incorporating offline priors such as SD maps and
HD maps or by fusing multi-modal data. However, these methods depend on stale
offline maps and multi-modal sensor suites, resulting in avoidable
computational overhead at inference. To address these limitations, we employ a
knowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models
with prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student
model. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal
knowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS)
paradigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with
SD/HD map priors serving as the teacher; (2) a vision-centric coach model with
prior knowledge and simulated LiDAR to bridge the cross-modal knowledge
transfer gap; and (3) a lightweight vision-based student model. Additionally,
we introduce two targeted knowledge distillation strategies: Token-Guided 2D
Patch Distillation (TGPD) for bird's eye view feature alignment and Masked
Semantic Response Distillation (MSRD) for semantic learning guidance. Extensive
experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapKD improves
the student model by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP while simultaneously
accelerating inference speed. The code is available

Abstract: Detailed 3D building models are crucial for urban planning, digital twins,
and disaster management applications. While Level of Detail 1 (LoD)1 and LoD2
building models are widely available, they lack detailed facade elements
essential for advanced urban analysis. In contrast, LoD3 models address this
limitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and
underpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual
modeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution,
CM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models
leveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis.
Unlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs
with synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map
Generator (SCMG). We also observe that additional segmentation of textured
models can be fused with CMs using confidence scores to further increase
segmentation performance and thus increase 3D reconstruction accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CM2LoD3 method in
segmenting and reconstructing building openings, with the 61% performance with
uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures. This research
contributes to the advancement of automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving
the way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling. Our project is available:

TL;DR: MDPR通过多维度动态路由框架解决预训练视觉-语言模型在类别不平衡场景下的微调偏见问题，取得了SOTA结果且计算开销低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练视觉-语言模型（VLMs）在类别不平衡场景下的微调存在偏见问题，尽管引入LLMs增强了VLM微调，但它们往往忽略了VLM预训练中固有的类别不平衡问题，这可能导致下游任务中的偏见累积。

Conclusion: MDPR框架通过构建包含五个视觉-语义维度的综合知识库，并利用动态路由机制对齐全局视觉类别、检索最优提示、平衡细粒度语义，最终通过logits融合实现稳定预测，在长尾基准测试中取得了与当前SOTA方法相当的结果，并且动态路由仅带来极小的计算开销，是一种灵活高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
impressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from
bias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language
models (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic
information. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs'
pre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To
address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt
Routing (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for
classes, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the
dynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal
prompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions
through logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks,
including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves
comparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm
the effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our
dynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible
and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.

Motivation: Existing methods for long video understanding with MLLMs suffer from substantial memory and computational overhead due to storing and attending to the KV cache for long visual contexts. Current visual compression methods are impractical as they require encoding the entire visual context beforehand or having advance access to questions.

Method: StreamMem is a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video understanding. It encodes new video frames in a streaming manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory for efficient QA in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios.

Result: Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question answering benchmarks shows the effectiveness of StreamMem.

Conclusion: StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware compression approaches on long video understanding and streaming video QA benchmarks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
visual-language reasoning, but their ability to efficiently handle long videos
remains limited. Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and
attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs
substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression
methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or
having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video
understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose
StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video
understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming
manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens
and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable
efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios.
Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question
answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance
in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware
compression approaches.

Motivation: 为了解决现有生成视频模型在长序列中结构和时间一致性差，以及RGB信号易累积误差的问题。

Method: WorldWeaver框架联合建模RGB帧和感知条件，通过构建记忆库利用深度线索保存上下文信息，并采用分段噪声调度进行训练。

Result: 实验证明WorldWeaver在减少时间漂移和提高生成视频保真度方面是有效的，适用于基于扩散和基于流的模型。

Conclusion: WorldWeaver通过联合建模RGB帧和感知条件，并利用深度线索和分段噪声调度，有效减少了长期视频生成中的时间漂移，提高了生成视频的保真度。

Abstract: Generative video modeling has made significant strides, yet ensuring
structural and temporal consistency over long sequences remains a challenge.
Current methods predominantly rely on RGB signals, leading to accumulated
errors in object structure and motion over extended durations. To address these
issues, we introduce WorldWeaver, a robust framework for long video generation
that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions within a unified
long-horizon modeling scheme. Our training framework offers three key
advantages. First, by jointly predicting perceptual conditions and color
information from a unified representation, it significantly enhances temporal
consistency and motion dynamics. Second, by leveraging depth cues, which we
observe to be more resistant to drift than RGB, we construct a memory bank that
preserves clearer contextual information, improving quality in long-horizon
video generation. Third, we employ segmented noise scheduling for training
prediction groups, which further mitigates drift and reduces computational
cost. Extensive experiments on both diffusion- and rectified flow-based models
demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldWeaver in reducing temporal drift and
improving the fidelity of generated videos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于视觉基础模型（特别是SAM）的计算病理学方法，在细粒度语义分割方面（如识别特定细胞亚型）面临挑战。本研究旨在提出一种新的模型来解决这些问题。

Method: 1. 提出了利用分子信息和SAM模型进行计算病理学分析的方法。2. 通过分子赋能学习，减少对像素级标注的需求，让非专业标注员也能参与。3. 利用SAM适配器使SAM模型适应特定语义。4. 结合分子导向的校正学习（MOCL）来提高分割精度。

Conclusion: 本文提出的All-in-SAM模型不仅降低了标注员的工作量，还将精确的生物医学图像分析扩展到了资源有限的环境中，从而促进了医学诊断和病理图像分析的自动化。

Abstract: Purpose: Recent developments in computational pathology have been driven by
advances in Vision Foundation Models, particularly the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods:
prompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for
direct segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a
range of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face
challenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying
specific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we
propose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational
pathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This
model incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging
lay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for
detailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to
emphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with
SAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating
Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results
from both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model
significantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with
varying annotation quality. Conclusions: Our approach not only reduces the
workload for annotators but also extends the accessibility of precise
biomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, thereby advancing
medical diagnostics and automating pathology image analysis.

Conclusion: Waver在运动捕捉、运动幅度、时间一致性方面表现出色，在T2V和I2V任务上均进入前三名，表现优于现有开源模型，并达到或超过了最先进的商业解决方案。

Abstract: We present Waver, a high-performance foundation model for unified image and
video generation. Waver can directly generate videos with durations ranging
from 5 to 10 seconds at a native resolution of 720p, which are subsequently
upscaled to 1080p. The model simultaneously supports text-to-video (T2V),
image-to-video (I2V), and text-to-image (T2I) generation within a single,
integrated framework. We introduce a Hybrid Stream DiT architecture to enhance
modality alignment and accelerate training convergence. To ensure training data
quality, we establish a comprehensive data curation pipeline and manually
annotate and train an MLLM-based video quality model to filter for the
highest-quality samples. Furthermore, we provide detailed training and
inference recipes to facilitate the generation of high-quality videos. Building
on these contributions, Waver excels at capturing complex motion, achieving
superior motion amplitude and temporal consistency in video synthesis. Notably,
it ranks among the Top 3 on both the T2V and I2V leaderboards at Artificial
Analysis (data as of 2025-07-30 10:00 GMT+8), consistently outperforming
existing open-source models and matching or surpassing state-of-the-art
commercial solutions. We hope this technical report will help the community
more efficiently train high-quality video generation models and accelerate
progress in video generation technologies. Official page:

TL;DR: ATLAS是一个高保真的人体模型，它通过解耦形状和骨架基以及利用大量扫描数据，提高了人体模型的表现力和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人体网格建模方法在捕捉不同姿势和形状的细节变化方面存在困难，原因是训练数据多样性有限以及模型假设受限。此外，先优化外部身体表面再回归内部骨骼关节的方法会引入内部骨架和外部软组织之间的依赖性问题，限制了对身体高度和骨骼长度的直接控制。

Method: ATLAS模型通过学习600,000个高分辨率扫描数据，将网格表示与人类骨架相结合，并将形状和骨架基进行了解耦，从而实现对身体属性的精细定制和独立于外部软组织特征的关键点拟合。

Result: ATLAS在拟合各种姿势下的未见过受试者方面比现有方法更准确，其非线性姿势校正比线性模型更能有效地捕捉复杂姿势。

Conclusion: ATLAS通过显式地将骨架和网格表示结合起来，实现了比现有方法更高保真度的人体模型，能够更准确地适应各种姿势和身体属性，并提供更有效的姿势校正。

Abstract: Parametric body models offer expressive 3D representation of humans across a
wide range of poses, shapes, and facial expressions, typically derived by
learning a basis over registered 3D meshes. However, existing human mesh
modeling approaches struggle to capture detailed variations across diverse body
poses and shapes, largely due to limited training data diversity and
restrictive modeling assumptions. Moreover, the common paradigm first optimizes
the external body surface using a linear basis, then regresses internal
skeletal joints from surface vertices. This approach introduces problematic
dependencies between internal skeleton and outer soft tissue, limiting direct
control over body height and bone lengths. To address these issues, we present
ATLAS, a high-fidelity body model learned from 600k high-resolution scans
captured using 240 synchronized cameras. Unlike previous methods, we explicitly
decouple the shape and skeleton bases by grounding our mesh representation in
the human skeleton. This decoupling enables enhanced shape expressivity,
fine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting independent
of external soft-tissue characteristics. ATLAS outperforms existing methods by
fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, and quantitative
evaluations show that our non-linear pose correctives more effectively capture
complex poses compared to linear models.

Abstract: 3D content generation has recently attracted significant research interest
due to its applications in VR/AR and embodied AI. In this work, we address the
challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene
image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a
novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as
input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture.
Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval;
(ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and
global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature
extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of
3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass;
(iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input
scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our
architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image
inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the
efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this
paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation,
potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks. The code

TL;DR: VAREdit是一个视觉自回归框架，通过预测下一个尺度来改进图像编辑，解决了扩散模型的局限性。它通过SAR模块有效利用源图像信息，在遵循度和效率方面均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决扩散模型在图像编辑中存在的全局去噪过程导致非预期的伪修改和编辑指令遵循性问题，该研究提出了一种新的视觉自回归框架。

Method: VAREdit是一个视觉自回归（VAR）框架，将图像编辑重构为下一个尺度预测问题。它以源图像特征和文本指令为条件，生成多尺度目标特征以实现精确编辑。为了有效注入源图像条件，该方法引入了一个尺度对齐参考（SAR）模块，该模块将尺度匹配的条件信息注入第一个自注意力层。

Result: VAREdit在编辑遵循度和效率方面表现优于现有方法，在标准基准测试中GPT-Balance得分提高了30%以上，编辑速度是UltraEdit的2.2倍。

Conclusion: VAREdit框架在编辑遵循度和效率方面均取得了显著进展，在标准基准测试中，其GPT-Balance得分比领先的基于扩散的方法高出30%以上，并且在1.2秒内完成了512x512的编辑，速度是类似大小的UltraEdit的2.2倍。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have brought remarkable visual fidelity
to instruction-guided image editing. However, their global denoising process
inherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading
to unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing
instructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by
formulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual
tokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the
adherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present
VAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as
a next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text
instructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise
edits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the
source image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot
effectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this
gap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects
scale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer.
VAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and
efficiency. On standard benchmarks, it outperforms leading diffusion-based
methods by 30\%+ higher GPT-Balance score. Moreover, it completes a
$512\times512$ editing in 1.2 seconds, making it 2.2$\times$ faster than the
similarly sized UltraEdit. The models are available at

*Haonan Qiu,Ning Yu,Ziqi Huang,Paul Debevec,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CineScale enhances diffusion models for high-resolution image (8k) and video (4k) generation without extensive fine-tuning, overcoming issues of repetitive patterns seen in previous methods by introducing a novel inference paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual diffusion models are limited to lower resolutions due to data and computational constraints, hindering high-fidelity image/video generation. Tuning-free strategies have emerged, but they often result in low-quality visuals with repetitive patterns caused by accumulated errors when generating beyond the training resolution. CineScale aims to address these limitations.

Method: CineScale is a novel inference paradigm designed to enable higher-resolution visual generation. It includes dedicated variants for different video generation architectures and supports high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis by building upon state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks.

Result: Experiments validate CineScale's superiority, enabling 8k image generation without fine-tuning and 4k video generation with minimal LoRA fine-tuning. The approach extends the capabilities of higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models.

Conclusion: CineScale's paradigm enables high-resolution image and video generation, demonstrating superiority in extending existing capabilities and achieving 8k image generation and 4k video generation with minimal fine-tuning.

Abstract: Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically
trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and
constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate
high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have
explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential
higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these
methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive
patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency
information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training
resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the
accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference
paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various
issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we
propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods
that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens
the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop
state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of
higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models.
Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning,
and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning. Generated

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新的LLM内容安全框架，通过单一SFT阶段集成了多种安全行为，并用“魔法令牌”控制。该方法效率高、成本低，性能优于现有模型，并提供了细粒度控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM内容安全方法（如SFT和RLHF）通常依赖多阶段训练，并且在部署后缺乏细粒度的可控性。为了解决这些局限性，需要一种更高效、更灵活的方法来集成和控制多种安全行为。

Method: 提出了一种统一的共训练框架，在大语言模型（LLMs）中集成了积极（合法/亲社会）、消极（未过滤/有风险）和拒绝（拒绝导向/保守）三种安全行为。该框架在单一的监督微调（SFT）阶段进行训练，通过简单的系统级指令或“魔法令牌”在推理时动态激活不同的安全行为，实现了高效的行为切换。该共训练策略在输出空间中产生了明显的“安全对齐边界”，使得不同安全模式的响应分布能够良好分离。

Result: 实验证明，该共训练框架在安全对齐质量上达到了SFT+DPO的水平，并且其8B模型在安全性能上显著优于DeepSeek-R1（671B）模型。此外，该方法显著降低了训练复杂度和部署成本。该框架生成的响应分布具有良好的分离度，证明了模型在安全鲁棒性方面的能力，并实现了前所未有的细粒度控制。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种统一的共训练框架，用于在大语言模型（LLMs）中集成多种安全行为（积极、消极和拒绝），并通过系统级指令或“魔法令牌”在推理时动态激活这些行为。该框架在单一的监督微调（SFT）阶段实现，与现有的多阶段训练方法相比，具有更高的效率和细粒度的可控性。实验表明，该方法在安全对齐质量上可与SFT+DPO相媲美，并且显著优于DeepSeek-R1模型，同时降低了训练复杂度和部署成本，为LLM内容安全提供了一个可扩展、高效且高度可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Current methods for content safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF), often rely on multi-stage training pipelines and lack fine-grained,
post-deployment controllability. To address these limitations, we propose a
unified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety
behaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and
rejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably,
each behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction,
or magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at
inference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as
positive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and
rejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals.
This co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the
output space, characterized by well-separated response distributions
corresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides
empirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented
fine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety
alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with our 8B model notably surpassing DeepSeek-R1
(671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing both training
complexity and deployment costs. This work presents a scalable, efficient, and
highly controllable solution for LLM content safety.

Motivation: 为了解决现有数学推理数据集缺乏本地化实体（如人名、组织名和货币）以及翻译基准可能模糊真实的跨语言数学能力的问题。

Method: 提出一个LLM驱动的数学应用文化本地化框架，该框架可以从现有来源自动构建包含本地名称、组织和货币的数据集。

Result: 实验表明，该框架可以减轻英语中心主义的实体偏见，并提高在引入本地实体时的鲁棒性，同时证明了翻译基准在适当的社会文化背景下可能会隐藏真实的跨语言数学能力。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的数学应用文化本地化框架可以减轻英语中心主义的实体偏见，并提高在引入本地实体时的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
solving mathematical problems expressed in natural language. However,
multilingual and culturally-grounded mathematical reasoning in low-resource
languages lags behind English due to the scarcity of socio-cultural task
datasets that reflect accurate native entities such as person names,
organization names, and currencies. Existing multilingual benchmarks are
predominantly produced via translation and typically retain English-centric
entities, owing to the high cost associated with human annotater-based
localization. Moreover, automated localization tools are limited, and hence,
truly localized datasets remain scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
framework for LLM-driven cultural localization of math word problems that
automatically constructs datasets with native names, organizations, and
currencies from existing sources. We find that translated benchmarks can
obscure true multilingual math ability under appropriate socio-cultural
contexts. Through extensive experiments, we also show that our framework can
help mitigate English-centric entity bias and improves robustness when native
entities are introduced across various languages.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在机器翻译方面展现了有效性，本研究旨在探索如何利用直接偏好优化（DPO）和少量易于获取的数据资源来改进通用的指令调整大型语言模型在机器翻译任务上的表现，并以斯洛文尼亚语作为具体应用案例。

Abstract: Large language models have emerged as effective machine translation systems.
In this paper, we explore how a general instruction-tuned large language model
can be improved for machine translation using relatively few easily produced
data resources. Using Slovene as a use case, we improve the GaMS-9B-Instruct
model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training on a programmatically
curated and enhanced subset of a public dataset. As DPO requires pairs of
quality-ranked instances, we generated its training dataset by translating
English Wikipedia articles using two LLMs, GaMS-9B-Instruct and
EuroLLM-9B-Instruct. We ranked the resulting translations based on heuristics
coupled with automatic evaluation metrics such as COMET. The evaluation shows
that our fine-tuned model outperforms both models involved in the dataset
generation. In comparison to the baseline models, the fine-tuned model achieved
a COMET score gain of around 0.04 and 0.02, respectively, on translating
Wikipedia articles. It also more consistently avoids language and formatting
errors.

TL;DR: 本研究通过构建多语言数据集和提出新的解析方法，提升了ConvXAI系统的多语言能力和对自定义输入的处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的ConvXAI系统在多语言支持和自由形式自定义输入方面存在挑战，主要由于训练数据 scarcity 和现有方法对用户意图识别的局限性，阻碍了其多语言泛化能力。

Method: 本研究提出了一种新的解析方法，并使用该方法在MultiCoXQL和Compass两个多语言数据集上对三种不同规模的LLM进行了评估，同时还评估了BERT类模型在Compass数据集上的单语、跨语和多语表现。

Result: 研究成功构建了多语言数据集MultiCoXQL和Compass，前者包含五种语言（包括一种低资源语言），后者包含11种意图；提出的新解析方法提升了多语言解析性能；通过对不同LLM的评估，验证了所提出方法和数据集的有效性。

Conclusion: 本研究通过引入多语言数据集MultiCoXQL和Compass，并提出新的解析方法，解决了现有ConvXAI系统在多语言支持和自定义输入方面的局限性，并评估了不同LLM在该数据集上的表现。

Abstract: Conversational explainable artificial intelligence (ConvXAI) systems based on
large language models (LLMs) have garnered considerable attention for their
ability to enhance user comprehension through dialogue-based explanations.
Current ConvXAI systems often are based on intent recognition to accurately
identify the user's desired intention and map it to an explainability method.
While such methods offer great precision and reliability in discerning users'
underlying intentions for English, a significant challenge in the scarcity of
training data persists, which impedes multilingual generalization. Besides, the
support for free-form custom inputs, which are user-defined data distinct from
pre-configured dataset instances, remains largely limited. To bridge these
gaps, we first introduce MultiCoXQL, a multilingual extension of the CoXQL
dataset spanning five typologically diverse languages, including one
low-resource language. Subsequently, we propose a new parsing approach aimed at
enhancing multilingual parsing performance, and evaluate three LLMs on
MultiCoXQL using various parsing strategies. Furthermore, we present Compass, a
new multilingual dataset designed for custom input extraction in ConvXAI
systems, encompassing 11 intents across the same five languages as MultiCoXQL.
We conduct monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual evaluations on Compass,
employing three LLMs of varying sizes alongside BERT-type models.

*Bolian Li,Yanran Wu,Xinyu Luo,Ruqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 针对大型语言模型（LLM）测试时对齐的高推理成本问题，提出了一种名为奖励偏移的推测性采样（SSS）算法，该算法利用对齐的草稿模型来提高效率，并在实验中取得了更好的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决测试时对齐技术的高推理成本问题，借鉴了推测性采样加速的思路，该技术利用一个小的草稿模型来有效预测未来的代币。

Method: 提出了一种名为奖励偏移的推测性采样（SSS）算法，该算法利用了与人类偏好对齐的草稿模型，同时保持目标模型不变。通过修改接受标准和奖励代币分布，理论上证明了对齐的草稿模型和未对齐的目标模型之间的分布偏移可以用来恢复强化学习（RLHF）的最优解，而无需实际获得它。

Result: 在测试时弱到强对齐实验中，该算法实现了更高的黄金奖励分数，同时显著降低了推理成本。

Conclusion: 该算法在测试时弱到强对齐实验中，在显著降低推理成本的同时，获得了更高的黄金奖励分数，验证了其有效性和效率。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a
critical step in their development. Recent research has increasingly focused on
test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to
enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time
alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their
practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling
acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future
tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We
introduce the reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the
draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains
unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between
the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to
recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying
the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves
superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in
test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its
effectiveness and efficiency.

*MohamamdJavad Ardestani,Ehsan Kamalloo,Davood Rafiei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongRecall是一个三阶段框架，用于评估机器生成文本的召回率，它将答案分解为事实，然后过滤并验证这些事实，以提高准确性，尤其是在长文本问答任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学、法律等领域以及列表式问答任务中，机器生成文本的完整性至关重要，因为信息遗漏可能导致严重后果。现有的召回率度量标准依赖于词汇重叠，容易在处理未经证实的实体和释义答案时出错；而长提示的LLM评判方法虽然能捕捉更广泛的语义，但若没有结构化验证，则容易出现不对齐和幻觉问题。

Method: LongRecall是一个包含三个阶段的通用召回率评估框架：首先将答案分解为独立的、完整的“事实”；其次，通过词汇和语义过滤逐步缩小潜在匹配项的范围；最后，通过结构化的蕴含检查来验证匹配事实的一致性。

Result: LongRecall框架通过分解答案、多阶段过滤和结构化蕴含检查，减少了误报和漏报，同时能够适应不同的表达方式和上下文变化，为系统性的召回率评估奠定了基础。

Conclusion: LongRecall框架在长文本问答的召回率评估中展现了超越传统词汇重叠和长提示LLM评判方法的显著提升，其准确性通过在三个具有挑战性的长文本问答基准上的人工标注和LLM评判实验得到验证。

Abstract: LongRecall. The completeness of machine-generated text, ensuring that it
captures all relevant information, is crucial in domains such as medicine and
law and in tasks like list-based question answering (QA), where omissions can
have serious consequences. However, existing recall metrics often depend on
lexical overlap, leading to errors with unsubstantiated entities and
paraphrased answers, while LLM-as-a-Judge methods with long holistic prompts
capture broader semantics but remain prone to misalignment and hallucinations
without structured verification. We introduce LongRecall, a general three-stage
recall evaluation framework that decomposes answers into self-contained facts,
successively narrows plausible candidate matches through lexical and semantic
filtering, and verifies their alignment through structured entailment checks.
This design reduces false positives and false negatives while accommodating
diverse phrasings and contextual variations, serving as a foundational building
block for systematic recall assessment. We evaluate LongRecall on three
challenging long-form QA benchmarks using both human annotations and LLM-based
judges, demonstrating substantial improvements in recall accuracy over strong
lexical and LLM-as-a-Judge baselines.

TL;DR: 通过结合LLM和组合推理，可以提高结构化预测的性能和一致性，即使在LLM时代，结构化学习仍然很重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在幻觉和复杂推理方面的不足，特别是在结构化预测任务中，旨在结合LLM的预测能力和推理方法提供的结构一致性。

Method: 提出结合LLM和组合推理来改进结构化预测，并通过实验研究了不同的提示策略对LLM置信度估计的影响。

Result: 无论采用何种提示策略，在提示基础上增加符号推理都能提高预测的一致性和准确性。同时，使用结构化预测目标进行校准和微调可以提升模型在挑战性任务上的性能。

Conclusion: LLM的结构化预测可以通过结合LLM和组合推理来改进，并且结合符号推理可以提高预测的一致性和准确性。此外，使用结构化预测目标进行校准和微调可以提高LLM在挑战性任务上的性能。

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to be useful for a variety of language tasks, without
requiring task-specific fine-tuning. However, these models often struggle with
hallucinations and complex reasoning problems due to their autoregressive
nature. We propose to address some of these issues, specifically in the area of
structured prediction, by combining LLMs with combinatorial inference in an
attempt to marry the predictive power of LLMs with the structural consistency
provided by inference methods. We perform exhaustive experiments in an effort
to understand which prompting strategies can effectively estimate LLM
confidence values for use with symbolic inference, and show that, regardless of
the prompting strategy, the addition of symbolic inference on top of prompting
alone leads to more consistent and accurate predictions. Additionally, we show
that calibration and fine-tuning using structured prediction objectives leads
to increased performance for challenging tasks, showing that structured
learning is still valuable in the era of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了 Nemotron-CC-Math，这是一个从 Common Crawl 提取的高质量数学语料库，通过改进的提取流水线解决了现有数据集的质量问题，并在数学、代码和通用推理方面显著提升了 LLM 的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数学数据集在从 Common Crawl 提取时存在质量下降的问题，这是由于提取方法不完善、HTML 到文本的转换存在信息损失以及数学结构未能得到可靠保留。因此，研究的动机是创建一个更高质量、更可靠的数学语料库，以增强大型语言模型的推理能力。

Method: 该研究引入了一个名为 Nemotron-CC-Math 的大规模、高质量数学语料库，该语料库利用了特定于领域的数据处理方法。该方法包括使用 Lynx 进行布局感知渲染，以及一个基于 LLM 的清理阶段，以从 Common Crawl 数据中提取和清理数学内容，并将其标准化为 LaTeX 格式。

Result: 研究构建了 Nemotron-CC-Math-3+ (133B 词元) 和 Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B 词元) 两个大规模高质量数学语料库。Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ 在 MATH 和 MBPP+ 基准测试上分别带来了 +4.8 至 +12.6 和 +4.6 至 +14.3 的性能提升，并在 MMLU 和 MMLU-Stem 上也展现了通用领域性能的改进。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一个能够从网络规模的嘈杂数据中可靠提取科学内容（包括数学内容）的流水线，在数学、代码和通用推理方面取得了可衡量的进展，并设定了开源数学预训练语料库的新标杆。研究团队已发布了相关的代码和数据集以支持开源社区。

Abstract: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on high-quality, structured data
such as mathematics and code substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.
However, existing math-focused datasets built from Common Crawl suffer from
degraded quality due to brittle extraction heuristics, lossy HTML-to-text
conversion, and the failure to reliably preserve mathematical structure. In
this work, we introduce Nemotron-CC-Math, a large-scale, high-quality
mathematical corpus constructed from Common Crawl using a novel,
domain-agnostic pipeline specifically designed for robust scientific text
extraction.
  Unlike previous efforts, our pipeline recovers math across various formats
(e.g., MathJax, KaTeX, MathML) by leveraging layout-aware rendering with lynx
and a targeted LLM-based cleaning stage. This approach preserves the structural
integrity of equations and code blocks while removing boilerplate,
standardizing notation into LaTeX representation, and correcting
inconsistencies.
  We collected a large, high-quality math corpus, namely Nemotron-CC-Math-3+
(133B tokens) and Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens). Notably,
Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ not only surpasses all prior open math datasets-including
MegaMath, FineMath, and OpenWebMath-but also contains 5.5 times more tokens
than FineMath-4+, which was previously the highest-quality math pretraining
dataset. When used to pretrain a Nemotron-T 8B model, our corpus yields +4.8 to
+12.6 gains on MATH and +4.6 to +14.3 gains on MBPP+ over strong baselines,
while also improving general-domain performance on MMLU and MMLU-Stem.
  We present the first pipeline to reliably extract scientific
content--including math--from noisy web-scale data, yielding measurable gains
in math, code, and general reasoning, and setting a new state of the art among
open math pretraining corpora. To support open-source efforts, we release our
code and datasets.

*Zijie Wang,Eduardo Blanco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with questions containing false assumptions. This paper presents a method using fact verification and external evidence to identify and answer such questions, improving accuracy and interpretability by validating assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of answering questions with false assumptions, which lack regular answers, and the tendency of LLMs to hallucinate and provide misleading answers.

Method: The approach reduces the problem to fact verification and leverages external evidence to mitigate hallucinations, involving generating and validating atomic assumptions.

Result: Experiments with five LLMs showed that retrieved evidence is beneficial, and a method of generating and validating atomic assumptions leads to further improvements and interpretable answers.

Conclusion: The study found that incorporating retrieved evidence and generating/validating atomic assumptions improves LLM responses to questions with false assumptions, offering interpretability by specifying these assumptions.

Abstract: People often ask questions with false assumptions, a type of question that
does not have regular answers. Answering such questions require first
identifying the false assumptions. Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate
misleading answers because of hallucinations. In this paper, we focus on
identifying and answering questions with false assumptions in several domains.
We first investigate to reduce the problem to fact verification. Then, we
present an approach leveraging external evidence to mitigate hallucinations.
Experiments with five LLMs demonstrate that (1) incorporating retrieved
evidence is beneficial and (2) generating and validating atomic assumptions
yields more improvements and provides an interpretable answer by specifying the
false assumptions.

*Seungmin Han,Haeun Kwon,Ji-jun Park,Taeyang Yoon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MMDR-Bench和CoLVLM Agent框架的提出，旨在解决现有视觉语言模型在处理复杂多模态对话中的局限性，CoLVLM Agent通过其独特的框架在各项评估中均优于当前顶尖模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM和LVLM在处理复杂、多轮、视觉基础的任务时存在挑战，如推理、上下文理解、实体跟踪和指令遵循不足；现有基准测试无法充分捕捉真实世界多模态交互的动态性，导致上下文丢失和视觉幻觉。

Method: 提出CoLVLM Agent框架，采用迭代的“记忆-感知-规划-执行”周期来增强现有LVLM模型，无需大量重新训练；并创建了MMDR-Bench数据集，包含300个复杂的多轮对话场景。

Result: CoLVLM Agent在MMDR-Bench上实现了优越的性能，平均人类评估得分为4.03，显著优于GPT-4o（3.92）和Gemini 1.5 Pro（3.85），在推理深度、指令遵循和错误抑制方面表现突出，并能维持长对话轮次的稳健性能。

Conclusion: CoLVLM Agent框架通过其迭代的“记忆-感知-规划-执行”周期，在MMDR-Bench上表现出色，平均人类评估得分达到4.03，超过了GPT-4o和Gemini 1.5 Pro等先进模型，证明了其在处理复杂多模态交互方面的有效性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), current models still face substantial
challenges in handling complex, multi-turn, and visually-grounded tasks that
demand deep reasoning, sustained contextual understanding, entity tracking, and
multi-step instruction following. Existing benchmarks often fall short in
capturing the dynamism and intricacies of real-world multi-modal interactions,
leading to issues such as context loss and visual hallucinations. To address
these limitations, we introduce MMDR-Bench (Multi-Modal Dialogue Reasoning
Benchmark), a novel dataset comprising 300 meticulously designed complex
multi-turn dialogue scenarios, each averaging 5-7 turns and evaluated across
six core dimensions including visual entity tracking and reasoning depth.
Furthermore, we propose CoLVLM Agent (Contextual LVLM Agent), a holistic
framework that enhances existing LVLMs with advanced reasoning and instruction
following capabilities through an iterative
"memory-perception-planning-execution" cycle, requiring no extensive
re-training of the underlying models. Our extensive experiments on MMDR-Bench
demonstrate that CoLVLM Agent consistently achieves superior performance,
attaining an average human evaluation score of 4.03, notably surpassing
state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o (3.92) and Gemini 1.5 Pro
(3.85). The framework exhibits significant advantages in reasoning depth,
instruction adherence, and error suppression, and maintains robust performance
over extended dialogue turns, validating the effectiveness of its modular
design and iterative approach for complex multi-modal interactions.

### [79] [SemToken: Semantic-Aware Tokenization for Efficient Long-Context Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15190)
*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemToken 是一种语义感知的标记化框架，通过合并语义等效的标记和根据语义密度分配异构标记粒度来减少标记冗余和提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于频率统计的标记化方法（如 BPE 或 WordPiece）忽略了文本的潜在语义结构，导致在长上下文场景中过度标记语义冗余跨度并低估上下文连贯性。

Method: SemToken 首先通过轻量级编码器提取上下文语义嵌入，并执行局部语义聚类以合并语义等效的标记。然后，它根据语义密度分配异构标记粒度，允许在内容丰富的区域进行更细粒度的标记，并在重复或低熵跨度中进行更粗粒度的压缩。

Result: SemToken 可以与现代语言模型和注意力加速方法无缝集成。在 WikiText-103 和 LongBench 等长上下文语言建模基准上的实验表明，SemToken 实现了高达 2.4 倍的标记数减少和 1.9 倍的速度提升，同时困惑度和下游准确率几乎没有下降或没有下降。

Conclusion: 语义结构为优化大型语言模型的标记化和计算提供了一个有前景的新方向。

Abstract: Tokenization plays a critical role in language modeling, yet existing
approaches such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece operate purely on
frequency statistics, ignoring the underlying semantic structure of text. This
leads to over-tokenization of semantically redundant spans and underutilization
of contextual coherence, particularly in long-context scenarios. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SemToken}, a semantic-aware tokenization framework that
jointly reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency. SemToken
first extracts contextual semantic embeddings via lightweight encoders and
performs local semantic clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens.
Then, it allocates heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density,
allowing finer-grained tokenization in content-rich regions and coarser
compression in repetitive or low-entropy spans. SemToken can be seamlessly
integrated with modern language models and attention acceleration methods.
Experiments on long-context language modeling benchmarks such as WikiText-103
and LongBench show that SemToken achieves up to $2.4\times$ reduction in token
count and $1.9\times$ speedup, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity
and downstream accuracy. Our findings suggest that semantic structure offers a
promising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large
language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fin-PRM 是一个针对金融领域优化的过程奖励模型，用于提升 LLM 的金融推理能力，并在多个金融基准测试中取得了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 PRM 主要在通用或 STEM 领域训练，在金融等结构化、符号化、对事实和监管敏感的领域表现不佳。因此，需要一个针对金融领域特点进行优化的 PRM。

Method: 提出并实现了一个名为 Fin-PRM 的领域专业化、轨迹感知的 PRM，用于评估金融任务中的 LLM 中间推理。Fin-PRM 集成了步级和轨迹级奖励监督，支持离线和在线奖励学习设置，并应用于轨迹选择、强化学习和推理指导。

Result: 在 CFLUE 和 FinQA 等金融推理基准测试中，Fin-PRM 在轨迹选择质量上持续优于通用 PRM 和领域基线。使用 Fin-PRM 训练的下游模型在监督学习、强化学习和测试时性能方面分别提高了 12.9%、5.2% 和 5.1%。

Conclusion: Fin-PRM 在金融推理任务中通过集成步级和轨迹级奖励监督，并在离线和在线奖励学习设置中进行应用，能够对 LLM 的中间推理步骤进行评估和改进，其效果优于通用 PRM 和领域基线，并在下游模型训练中带来了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising framework for
supervising intermediate reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet
existing PRMs are primarily trained on general or Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) domains and fall short in domain-specific
contexts such as finance, where reasoning is more structured, symbolic, and
sensitive to factual and regulatory correctness. We introduce \textbf{Fin-PRM},
a domain-specialized, trajectory-aware PRM tailored to evaluate intermediate
reasoning steps in financial tasks. Fin-PRM integrates step-level and
trajectory-level reward supervision, enabling fine-grained evaluation of
reasoning traces aligned with financial logic. We apply Fin-PRM in both offline
and online reward learning settings, supporting three key applications: (i)
selecting high-quality reasoning trajectories for distillation-based supervised
fine-tuning, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for reinforcement
learning, and (iii) guiding reward-informed Best-of-N inference at test time.
Experimental results on financial reasoning benchmarks, including CFLUE and
FinQA, demonstrate that Fin-PRM consistently outperforms general-purpose PRMs
and strong domain baselines in trajectory selection quality. Downstream models
trained with Fin-PRM yield substantial improvements with baselines, with gains
of 12.9\% in supervised learning, 5.2\% in reinforcement learning, and 5.1\% in
test-time performance. These findings highlight the value of domain-specialized
reward modeling for aligning LLMs with expert-level financial reasoning. Our
project resources will be available at https://github.com/aliyun/qwen-dianjin.

*Huanxuan Liao,Yixing Xu,Shizhu He,Guanchen Li,Xuanwu Yin,Dong Li,Emad Barsoum,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPARK是一种用于长上下文LLM的KV缓存压缩技术，通过通道级稀疏性和动态恢复，在减少内存占用的同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KV缓存压缩方法主要沿着时间轴进行压缩，但忽略了特征维度（通道轴）的细粒度重要性变化，这限制了它们在效率和模型准确性之间取得良好平衡的能力。通道显著性在查询和位置之间存在巨大差异，某些特征通道对于给定的查询信息量极少，而其他通道则高度相关。

Method: SPARK是一种无需训练的即插即用方法，通过在KV的通道级别应用非结构化稀疏性来实现，并在注意力分数计算期间动态恢复已修剪的条目。

Result: SPARK将KV缓存存储减少了30%以上，同时保持或提高了模型准确性。在80%的修剪率下，与基线淘汰方法相比，性能下降小于5%。

Conclusion: SPARK通过在通道级别修剪KV并在注意力分数计算过程中动态恢复修剪条目，实现了无需训练的即插即用。它通过减少通道级别的冗余，在相同的内存预算内处理更长的序列。与基于淘汰的方法相比，SPARK在等长序列上可将KV缓存存储减少30%以上，同时保持或提高模型准确性。即使在80%的激进修剪率下，SPARK的性能下降也仅为5%，证明了其鲁棒性和有效性。

Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with
sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing
approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal
axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and
computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained
importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis),
thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model
accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically
across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero
information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this
oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies
unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically
restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our
approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques,
making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration.
By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer
sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK
not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage
by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an
aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less
degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its
robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at
https://github.com/Xnhyacinth/SparK.

TL;DR: 为解决大模型在领域问答中的不足，提出S2K框架，通过知识自我选择和选择性微调，以更低成本提升了在医疗、法律、金融等领域的问答能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在领域特定场景下表现不佳，检索增强生成（RAG）存在噪声检索导致的幻觉和延迟问题，而持续预训练成本高昂且缺乏跨领域灵活性。作者认为这是由于领域知识的长尾分布导致部分有用的内部知识未被充分利用。因此，作者提出应采用类似人类学习的渐进式知识获取方式，即先理解概念，再应用于复杂推理。

Method: 提出了一种名为Selct2Know (S2K)的框架，该框架采用内部-外部知识自我选择策略和选择性监督微调来内化领域知识。此外，还引入了结构化推理数据生成流程，并集成了GRPO来提升推理能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，S2K在医疗、法律和金融领域的问答基准测试中，能够持续超越现有方法，并且在成本显著降低的情况下，达到了与领域预训练的大型语言模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: Selct2Know (S2K)框架通过内部-外部知识自我选择策略和选择性监督微调，有效解决了大型语言模型在领域特定问答中的挑战，实现了低成本的领域知识内化，并在医疗、法律和金融领域问答基准测试中表现优于现有方法，成本却显著降低。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general QA but often struggle in
domain-specific scenarios. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces
external knowledge but suffers from hallucinations and latency due to noisy
retrievals. Continued pretraining internalizes domain knowledge but is costly
and lacks cross-domain flexibility. We attribute this challenge to the
long-tail distribution of domain knowledge, which leaves partial yet useful
internal knowledge underutilized. We further argue that knowledge acquisition
should be progressive, mirroring human learning: first understanding concepts,
then applying them to complex reasoning. To address this, we propose Selct2Know
(S2K), a cost-effective framework that internalizes domain knowledge through an
internal-external knowledge self-selection strategy and selective supervised
fine-tuning. We also introduce a structured reasoning data generation pipeline
and integrate GRPO to enhance reasoning ability. Experiments on medical, legal,
and financial QA benchmarks show that S2K consistently outperforms existing
methods and matches domain-pretrained LLMs with significantly lower cost.

TL;DR: SEER 是一种创新的方法，通过从动态更新的经验池中进行分步检索，提高了大型语言模型在多步工具使用方面的能力，减少了对人工设计和提示工程的依赖，并在多个基准测试中取得了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多步工具使用方法通常依赖于手动设计的特定任务演示或从策划的库中检索，这需要大量的专家精力，并且随着工具多样性和任务难度的增加，提示工程变得越来越复杂和低效。

Method: SEER (Stepwise Experience Recall) 是一种自我指导的方法，通过细粒度的、分步的检索来执行多步工具使用。它从一个不断更新的经验池中检索，并将过去成功的轨迹增量地添加到经验池中，从而实现了经验池的持续扩展和模型性能的随时间推移的提升。

Result: 在 ToolQA 基准测试中，SEER 在简单问题上平均提高了 6.1%，在困难问题上提高了 4.7%。在 $	au$-bench 基准测试中，使用 Qwen2.5-7B 和 Qwen2.5-72B 模型，SEER 分别实现了 7.44% 和 23.38% 的显著准确率提升。

Conclusion: SEER 通过增量地从不断更新的经验池中检索，解决了多步工具使用中的工具选择、参数生成和工具链规划问题。它不需要手动设计特定任务的演示或从策划库中检索，从而减少了专家精力，并使提示工程随着工具多样性和任务难度的增加而变得更加简单和高效。

Abstract: Function calling enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external systems by leveraging tools and APIs. When faced with multi-step tool
usage, LLMs still struggle with tool selection, parameter generation, and
tool-chain planning. Existing methods typically rely on manually designing
task-specific demonstrations, or retrieving from a curated library. These
approaches demand substantial expert effort and prompt engineering becomes
increasingly complex and inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty
scale. To address these challenges, we propose a self-guided method, Stepwise
Experience Recall (SEER), which performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from
a continually updated experience pool. Instead of relying on static or manually
curated library, SEER incrementally augments the experience pool with past
successful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion of the pool and improved
model performance over time. Evaluated on the ToolQA benchmark, SEER achieves
an average improvement of 6.1\% on easy and 4.7\% on hard questions. We further
test SEER on $\tau$-bench, which includes two real-world domains. Powered by
Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains
of 7.44\% and 23.38\%, respectively.

### [84] [Are Checklists Really Useful for Automatic Evaluation of Generative Tasks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15218)
*Momoka Furuhashi,Kouta Nakayama,Takashi Kodama,Saku Sugawara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究调查了在生成任务评估中是应普遍使用还是选择性使用checklist，并分析了不同生成方法、模型大小和checklist项目对评估性能的影响。研究发现，选择性使用checklist在成对比较任务中可能更有效，但在直接评分任务中的效果不确定。此外，研究还揭示了人类评估标准可能存在不一致性，并强调了明确客观评估标准的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动评估生成任务使用大型语言模型面临含糊不清的标准带来的挑战，而自动checklist生成是一个有潜力但未被充分探索的方法。

Method: 通过实验研究了将checklist用于所有问题还是选择性地用于问题，并使用六种方法生成了checklist，评估了其在八种模型尺寸上的有效性，并识别了与人类评估相关的checklist项目。

Result: 选择性地使用checklist倾向于在成对比较设置中提高评估性能，但在直接评分中益处不那么一致。即使是与人类分数低度相关的checklist项目也常常反映了人类编写的标准，这表明人类评估中可能存在不一致性。

Conclusion: 应更清晰地定义客观评估标准，以指导人类和自动评估。

Abstract: Automatic evaluation of generative tasks using large language models faces
challenges due to ambiguous criteria. Although automatic checklist generation
is a potentially promising approach, its usefulness remains underexplored. We
investigate whether checklists should be used for all questions or selectively,
generate them using six methods, evaluate their effectiveness across eight
model sizes, and identify checklist items that correlate with human
evaluations. Through experiments on pairwise comparison and direct scoring
tasks, we find that selective checklist use tends to improve evaluation
performance in pairwise settings, while its benefits are less consistent in
direct scoring. Our analysis also shows that even checklist items with low
correlation to human scores often reflect human-written criteria, indicating
potential inconsistencies in human evaluation. These findings highlight the
need to more clearly define objective evaluation criteria to guide both human
and automatic evaluations. \footnote{Our code is available

*Hanling Zhang,Yayu Zhou,Tongcheng Fang,Zhihang Yuan,Guohao Dai,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VocabTailor通过卸载嵌入式组件和混合静态-动态词汇选择策略，有效解决了SLM在边缘部署中的内存限制问题，实现了高达99%的内存削减，且性能几乎不受影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决小型语言模型（SLM）在资源受限环境（尤其是边缘设备）部署中，由大词汇量引起的内存瓶颈问题，并克服现有静态词汇修剪方法带来的信息丢失和灵活性不足的缺点。

Method: VocabTailor是一个新颖的解耦动态词汇选择框架，通过卸载嵌入式组件并为语言模型（LM）头实现混合静态-动态词汇选择策略，从而在内存限制下实现按需加载词汇组件。

Result: 实验证明，VocabTailor在保持最小或无性能下降的情况下，显著减少了内存使用量。

Conclusion: VocabTailor实现了词汇相关组件高达99%的内存使用量减少，且任务性能几乎没有下降，显著优于现有的静态词汇修剪方法。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) provide computational advantages in
resource-constrained environments, yet memory limitations remain a critical
bottleneck for edge device deployment. A substantial portion of SLMs' memory
footprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and
language modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static
vocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid,
one-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage
and a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles
underlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle,
the observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any
single inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between
vocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce
VocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that
addresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a
hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling
on-demand loading of vocabulary components. Comprehensive experiments across
diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that VocabTailor achieves a reduction of
up to 99% in the memory usage of vocabulary-related components with minimal or
no degradation in task performance, substantially outperforming existing static
vocabulary pruning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估和改进大型语言模型在泰语等低资源语言中的指令遵循能力，解决现有基准依赖翻译且缺乏文化和领域特异性细微差别的问题。

Method: 使用包含四个专业领域和七种任务类型的人工编写的泰语数据集WangchanThaiInstruct进行评估和指令调整。

Result: 在WangchanThaiInstruct上进行微调的模型在特定领域内外的基准测试中均优于使用翻译数据的模型，证明了本地化指令数据的有效性。

Conclusion: 为提高低资源、语言多样化环境中大型语言模型的对齐能力，需要使用符合当地文化和专业的指令数据。

Abstract: Large language models excel at instruction-following in English, but their
performance in low-resource languages like Thai remains underexplored. Existing
benchmarks often rely on translations, missing cultural and domain-specific
nuances needed for real-world use. We present WangchanThaiInstruct, a
human-authored Thai dataset for evaluation and instruction tuning, covering
four professional domains and seven task types. Created through a multi-stage
quality control process with annotators, domain experts, and AI researchers,
WangchanThaiInstruct supports two studies: (1) a zero-shot evaluation showing
performance gaps on culturally and professionally specific tasks, and (2) an
instruction tuning study with ablations isolating the effect of native
supervision. Models fine-tuned on WangchanThaiInstruct outperform those using
translated data in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings
underscore the need for culturally and professionally grounded instruction data
to improve LLM alignment in low-resource, linguistically diverse settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决多语种语音技术在处理现实世界对话中常见的语种转换（CS）现象时面临的挑战，主要是由于缺乏合适的CS数据集。

Method: 提出了一种名为“通用跨语种混合器”（UniCoM）的新型流水线，并利用一种名为“用同义词替换单词”（SWORDS）的算法来生成跨语种转换语音。SWORDS算法通过在考虑词性的同时替换选定的单词及其翻译来生成跨语种语音。

Result: 实验结果表明，CS-FLEURS语料库具有高清晰度和自然度，在客观和主观指标上均与现有数据集相当。CS-FLEURS语料库可以用于自动语音识别（ASR）和语音到文本翻译（S2TT）。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的UniCoM方法能够生成高质量、自然的跨语种转换语音样本，并且不改变句子语义。所构建的CS-FLEURS语料库在自动语音识别和语音到文本翻译方面表现优异，与现有数据集相当，有望推动跨语种语音技术的发展和包容性多语种系统的实现。

Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a
single speaker's utterances, is common in real-world conversations and poses
significant challenges for multilingual speech technology. However, systems
capable of handling this phenomenon remain underexplored, primarily due to the
scarcity of suitable datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Universal
Code-Mixer (UniCoM), a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, natural CS
samples without altering sentence semantics. Our approach utilizes an algorithm
we call Substituting WORDs with Synonyms (SWORDS), which generates CS speech by
replacing selected words with their translations while considering their parts
of speech. Using UniCoM, we construct Code-Switching FLEURS (CS-FLEURS), a
multilingual CS corpus designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
speech-to-text translation (S2TT). Experimental results show that CS-FLEURS
achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to
existing datasets on both objective and subjective metrics. We expect our
approach to advance CS speech technology and enable more inclusive multilingual
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在模拟职业角色时，缺乏全面的心理和伦理评估，尤其是在教育领域。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: EMNLP框架通过88个教师特定的道德困境，对大语言模型进行个性、道德发展和伦理风险评估，并通过软提示注入评估其合规性和脆弱性。

Result: 实验表明，模拟教师角色的LLMs表现出比人类教师更理想化和两极分化的个性，在抽象道德推理方面表现优异，但在情感复杂情境中遇到困难。模型能力越强，越容易受到有害提示注入的影响，揭示了能力与安全之间的悖论。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了EMNLP框架，首次对教育领域大语言模型的心理和伦理进行基准测试，为教育AI的伦理和心理对齐提供了评估方法。

Abstract: Simulating Professions (SP) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate
professional roles. However, comprehensive psychological and ethical evaluation
in these contexts remains lacking. This paper introduces EMNLP, an
Educator-role Moral and Normative LLMs Profiling framework for personality
profiling, moral development stage measurement, and ethical risk under soft
prompt injection. EMNLP extends existing scales and constructs 88
teacher-specific moral dilemmas, enabling profession-oriented comparison with
human teachers. A targeted soft prompt injection set evaluates compliance and
vulnerability in teacher SP. Experiments on 12 LLMs show teacher-role LLMs
exhibit more idealized and polarized personalities than human teachers, excel
in abstract moral reasoning, but struggle with emotionally complex situations.
Models with stronger reasoning are more vulnerable to harmful prompt injection,
revealing a paradox between capability and safety. The model temperature and
other hyperparameters have limited influence except in some risk behaviors.
This paper presents the first benchmark to assess ethical and psychological
alignment of teacher-role LLMs for educational AI. Resources are available at

*Eunseong Choi,June Park,Hyeri Lee,Jongwuk Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CARE is a new method to improve retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by addressing conflicts between external knowledge and the LLM's internal knowledge. It uses a context assessor to identify unreliable context and guides the LLM towards more reliable information, resulting in a 5.0% performance improvement on QA and fact-checking tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: When the retrieved context contradicts the LLM's parametric knowledge, it often fails to resolve the conflict between incorrect external context and correct parametric knowledge, known as context-memory conflict.

Method: CARE, consisting of a context assessor and a base LLM. The context assessor encodes compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens. Through grounded/adversarial soft prompting, the context assessor is trained to discern unreliable context and capture a guidance signal that directs reasoning toward the more reliable knowledge source.

Result: Extensive experiments show that CARE effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average performance gain of 5.0% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks.

Conclusion: CARE effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average performance gain of 5.0% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks, establishing a promising direction for trustworthy and adaptive RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into their input
prompts. However, when the retrieved context contradicts the LLM's parametric

tackle this problem, we introduce Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation
(CARE), consisting of a context assessor and a base LLM. The context assessor
encodes compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens. Through
grounded/adversarial soft prompting, the context assessor is trained to discern
unreliable context and capture a guidance signal that directs reasoning toward
the more reliable knowledge source. Extensive experiments show that CARE
effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average
performance gain of 5.0\% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks, establishing a

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究旨在解决大型语言模型在理解和生成需要时间常识的文本方面的挑战。研究人员提出了一种利用大型语言模型提取时间常识的方法，并构建了一个名为TComQA的数据集。实验结果表明，该方法能够有效提取时间常识，并且在时间问答任务上取得了优于现有模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解事件需要掌握其时间背景，而这在自然语言中常常没有明确说明。即使是先进的大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成需要推理时间常识的文本方面也存在困难，因为文本中很少明确提及。

Method: 提出一个利用LLMs自动挖掘时间常识的管道，并利用其构建TComQA数据集，该数据集通过众包验证，提取时间常识的精确率超过80%。

Result: TComQA数据集的精确率超过80%，并且使用TComQA训练的模型在时间问答任务上优于在现有数据集上微调的LLM。

Conclusion: 利用LLMs提取时间常识，并构建TComQA数据集，该模型在时间问答任务上表现优于现有模型。

Abstract: Understanding events necessitates grasping their temporal context, which is
often not explicitly stated in natural language. For example, it is not a
trivial task for a machine to infer that a museum tour may last for a few
hours, but can not take months. Recent studies indicate that even advanced
large language models (LLMs) struggle in generating text that require reasoning
with temporal commonsense due to its infrequent explicit mention in text.
Therefore, automatically mining temporal commonsense for events enables the
creation of robust language models. In this work, we investigate the capacity
of LLMs to extract temporal commonsense from text and evaluate multiple
experimental setups to assess their effectiveness. Here, we propose a temporal
commonsense extraction pipeline that leverages LLMs to automatically mine
temporal commonsense and use it to construct TComQA, a dataset derived from
SAMSum and RealNews corpora. TComQA has been validated through crowdsourcing
and achieves over 80\% precision in extracting temporal commonsense. The model
trained with TComQA also outperforms an LLM fine-tuned on existing dataset of
temporal question answering task.

TL;DR: CUPE是一个轻量级模型，可以在120毫秒内识别音素，并通过学习跨语言的基本声学模式，实现了有竞争力的跨语言性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发CUPE模型是为了提供一种轻量级的解决方案，能够提取不受上下文影响的纯音素表示，以满足多种语音处理任务的需求。

Method: CUPE模型处理独立的、固定宽度的短语音窗口，并仅使用120毫秒的语音片段来捕捉关键的音素特征。

Result: CUPE模型在跨语言性能上具有竞争力，即使参数量少于现有方法，也能通过学习所有语言共有的基本声学模式来取得成功。在UCLA音素语料库上的监督和自监督训练以及零样本测试也证明了其良好的跨语言泛化能力。

Conclusion: CUPE模型通过在音素长度的时间窗口内对基本声学模式进行建模，实现了有效的通用语音处理，展示了强大的跨语言泛化能力。

Abstract: Universal phoneme recognition typically requires analyzing long speech
segments and language-specific patterns. Many speech processing tasks require
pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence, which motivated
our development of CUPE - a lightweight model that captures key phoneme
features in just 120 milliseconds, about one phoneme's length. CUPE processes
short, fixed-width windows independently and, despite fewer parameters than
current approaches, achieves competitive cross-lingual performance by learning
fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages. Our extensive evaluation
through supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages, including
zero-shot tests on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus, demonstrates strong cross-lingual
generalization and reveals that effective universal speech processing is
possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length
windows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的知识图谱补全模型评估方法存在跨数据集和跨指标比较困难的问题，可能导致评估结果不一致和模型选择困难。

Method: 提出了一种名为 EDAS（基于距离平均解的知识图谱评估）的新型元评估指标，该指标将模型在多个数据集和不同评估指标（如 MRR、MR、Hit@k）上的性能整合为一个单一的归一化分数。

Result: 在 FB15k-237 和 WN18RR 等基准数据集上的实验结果表明，EDAS 能够有效地整合多指标、多数据集的性能，形成统一的排名，提供了一致、稳健且可泛化的评估框架。

Conclusion: EDAS 提供了一个统一、公平且可解释的评估框架，用于跨数据集和多指标评估知识图谱补全模型。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enable applications in various domains such as
semantic search, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. KGs
are often incomplete, missing entities and relations, an issue addressed by
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods that predict missing elements.
Different evaluation metrics, such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank
(MR), and Hit@k, are commonly used to assess the performance of such KGC
models. A major challenge in evaluating KGC models, however, lies in comparing
their performance across multiple datasets and metrics. A model may outperform
others on one dataset but underperform on another, making it difficult to
determine overall superiority. Moreover, even within a single dataset,
different metrics such as MRR and Hit@1 can yield conflicting rankings, where
one model excels in MRR while another performs better in Hit@1, further
complicating model selection for downstream tasks. These inconsistencies hinder
holistic comparisons and highlight the need for a unified meta-metric that
integrates performance across all metrics and datasets to enable a more
reliable and interpretable evaluation framework. To address this need, we
propose KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), a robust
and interpretable meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across
multiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized
score ($M_i \in [0,1]$). Unlike traditional metrics that focus on isolated
aspects of performance, EDAS offers a global perspective that supports more
informed model selection and promotes fairness in cross-dataset evaluation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as FB15k-237 and WN18RR
demonstrate that EDAS effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset
performance into a unified ranking, offering a consistent, robust, and
generalizable framework for evaluating KGC models.

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of the depth and breadth of large
language models' capabilities, various corresponding evaluation benchmarks have
been emerging in increasing numbers. As a quantitative assessment tool for
model performance, benchmarks are not only a core means to measure model
capabilities but also a key element in guiding the direction of model
development and promoting technological innovation. We systematically review
the current status and development of large language model benchmarks for the
first time, categorizing 283 representative benchmarks into three categories:
general capabilities, domain-specific, and target-specific. General capability
benchmarks cover aspects such as core linguistics, knowledge, and reasoning;
domain-specific benchmarks focus on fields like natural sciences, humanities
and social sciences, and engineering technology; target-specific benchmarks pay
attention to risks, reliability, agents, etc. We point out that current
benchmarks have problems such as inflated scores caused by data contamination,
unfair evaluation due to cultural and linguistic biases, and lack of evaluation
on process credibility and dynamic environments, and provide a referable design
paradigm for future benchmark innovation.

Conclusion: MultiTrust-X 评估结果揭示了当前 MLLMs 在可信度方面存在显著漏洞，例如可信度与通用能力之间存在差距，并且多模态训练和推理放大了基础 LLM 的潜在风险。现有的缓解策略在特定方面虽有改进，但很少能有效解决整体可信度问题，且常引入意想不到的权衡。RESA 方法通过增强模型的链式思考推理能力来发现潜在风险，实现了最先进的结果。

Abstract: The trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains an
intense concern despite the significant progress in their capabilities.
Existing evaluation and mitigation approaches often focus on narrow aspects and
overlook risks introduced by the multimodality. To tackle these challenges, we
propose MultiTrust-X, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating, analyzing, and
mitigating the trustworthiness issues of MLLMs. We define a three-dimensional
framework, encompassing five trustworthiness aspects which include
truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy; two novel risk types
covering multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts; and various mitigation
strategies from the perspectives of data, model architecture, training, and
inference algorithms. Based on the taxonomy, MultiTrust-X includes 32 tasks and
28 curated datasets, enabling holistic evaluations over 30 open-source and
proprietary MLLMs and in-depth analysis with 8 representative mitigation
methods. Our extensive experiments reveal significant vulnerabilities in
current models, including a gap between trustworthiness and general
capabilities, as well as the amplification of potential risks in base LLMs by
both multimodal training and inference. Moreover, our controlled analysis
uncovers key limitations in existing mitigation strategies that, while some
methods yield improvements in specific aspects, few effectively address overall
trustworthiness, and many introduce unexpected trade-offs that compromise model
utility. These findings also provide practical insights for future
improvements, such as the benefits of reasoning to better balance safety and
performance. Based on these insights, we introduce a Reasoning-Enhanced Safety
Alignment (RESA) approach that equips the model with chain-of-thought reasoning
ability to discover the underlying risks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

*Jaydip Sen,Subhasis Dasgupta,Hetvi Waghela*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new method for speculative decoding that uses confidence-based signals to dynamically adjust the drafting and verification processes. This method speeds up autoregressive inference and maintains or improves output quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speculative decoding methods rely on static drafting lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across varying model uncertainties and input complexities.

Method: The proposed method uses an information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on confidence-modulated drafting, which uses entropy and margin-based uncertainty measures to adjust the number of speculatively generated tokens at each iteration and modulates the verification process using the same confidence signals.

Result: The proposed method reduces rollback frequency, improves resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Experiments show significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or improving BLEU and ROUGE scores.

Conclusion: Speculative decoding can be efficiently and robustly performed in large language models under varying conditions of uncertainty by using the proposed information-theoretic framework.

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating
autoregressive inference by parallelizing token generation through a
draft-then-verify paradigm. However, existing methods rely on static drafting
lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across
varying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an
information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on
confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based
uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed
method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each
iteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves
resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the
verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling
more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation
quality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate
significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or
improving BLEU and ROUGE scores. The proposed approach offers a principled,
plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under
varying conditions of uncertainty.

*Woojin Chung,Jeonghoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究表明，更大的词汇量能通过降低高频词的表示复杂度来提升LLM性能，模型会利用而非受制于词频不平衡性。扩大模型参数量也能达到类似效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究的动机在于探究当前大型语言模型训练中普遍采用的更大词汇量带来的好处的根本原因。尽管实践中倾向于使用更大的词汇量，但其带来的收益机制尚不明确。因此，本研究旨在通过控制变量的实验研究，揭示词汇量扩展、文本复杂度、词频不平衡性以及模型性能之间的关系，并为分词器和模型的协同设计提供指导。

Method: 该研究通过控制数据、计算和优化等因素，将语言模型的词汇量从24K扩展到196K，以此来研究词汇量对语言模型性能的影响。研究量化了分词后文本的复杂度（形式化为柯尔莫哥洛夫复杂度），并进行了词级别损失分解。此外，研究还通过约束输入输出嵌入范数来验证模型是否利用了词频不平衡性，并通过调整模型参数量来比较不同扩展方式的效果。

Result: 研究发现，虽然更大的词汇量确实降低了分词后文本的复杂度，但这种降低主要集中在高频词上（特别是前2,500个高频词），并主要通过降低这些高频词的交叉熵损失来实现，而低频词的损失甚至有所上升。通过约束嵌入范数来减弱词频不平衡性的影响，会逆转性能提升，这表明模型实际上是利用了词频不平衡性。这种通过高频词获得的训练优势可以转移到下游任务中，因为高频词在下游任务中占据了约77%的比例。此外，研究还发现，在固定词汇量的情况下，扩大模型参数量也能带来与扩大词汇量相似的性能提升。

Conclusion: 大型词汇量通过降低文本复杂度来提高语言模型的性能，这主要是通过减少高频词的表示复杂度实现的，尽管这会略微增加低频词的损失。模型确实会利用而非受制于这种不平衡性，并且这种优势可以转移到下游任务中。与扩大词汇量相比，扩大模型参数量（在固定词汇量下）也能获得相似的性能提升。这项研究为分词器与模型的协同设计提供了一个简单的、有原则性的方法，并阐明了影响预训练语言模型扩展的损失动态。

distribution is highly imbalanced: a few words dominate the stream while most
occur rarely. Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source
of the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the
language model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and
optimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,
formalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce
this complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so
further growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A
word-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce
cross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most
frequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and
output embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance
reverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers
from imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in
downstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show
that enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same
frequent-word benefit. Our results reframe "bigger vocabularies help" as
"lowering the complexity of tokenized text helps," providing a simple,
principled lever for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics
that govern language-model scaling in pre-training.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）的采用不断增加，人们对其可靠性和可信度的担忧日益加剧。因此，越来越多的研究专注于使用 LLM 进行基于证据的文本生成，旨在将模型输出与支持性证据联系起来，以确保可追溯性和可验证性。

Method: 通过系统分析 134 篇论文，引入基于证据的、使用 LLM 进行文本生成的统一分类法，并研究七个关键维度中的 300 个评估指标，重点关注使用引用、归属或引述作为证据的文本生成方法。

Result: 我们检查了该领域的独特特征和代表性方法，并强调了开放的挑战以及为未来工作勾勒出有前景的方向。

Conclusion: 该领域存在不一致的术语、孤立的评估实践以及缺乏统一的基准测试，因此该领域是碎片化的。为了弥合这一差距，我们系统地分析了 134 篇论文，引入了基于证据的、使用 LLM 进行文本生成的统一分类法，并研究了七个关键维度中的 300 个评估指标。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has been accompanied
by growing concerns regarding their reliability and trustworthiness. As a
result, a growing body of research focuses on evidence-based text generation
with LLMs, aiming to link model outputs to supporting evidence to ensure
traceability and verifiability. However, the field is fragmented due to
inconsistent terminology, isolated evaluation practices, and a lack of unified
benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we systematically analyze 134 papers, introduce
a unified taxonomy of evidence-based text generation with LLMs, and investigate
300 evaluation metrics across seven key dimensions. Thereby, we focus on
approaches that use citations, attribution, or quotations for evidence-based
text generation. Building on this, we examine the distinctive characteristics
and representative methods in the field. Finally, we highlight open challenges
and outline promising directions for future work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了MCR-BENCH基准，发现大型语言模型在处理音频和文本信息不一致时存在文本偏见，倾向于忽略音频，导致性能下降和可靠性问题。研究还探讨了偏见的影响因素和缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在处理包含不一致音频和文本信息的模态时的表现，特别是它们在信息优先级排序方面的能力。

Method: 提出MCR-BENCH基准来评估大型语言模型在处理不一致的音频-文本对时的信息优先顺序。通过对各种音频理解任务进行广泛评估，并研究影响文本偏见的因素，以及通过监督微调探索缓解策略。

Result: 研究发现，当音频和文本信息不一致时，大型语言模型表现出明显的文本偏见，倾向于忽略音频证据。这种偏见会导致音频任务性能显著下降。此外，模型在面对矛盾输入时仍表现出持续的过度自信。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在处理不一致的多模态输入时存在明显的文本偏见，这会导致在以音频为中心的任务上性能下降，并引发对实际应用可靠性的担忧。需要改进训练过程中的模态平衡和开发更复杂的多模态融合机制，以提高其处理冲突信息的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are enhanced with audio perception
capabilities, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal
inputs that combine audio and text. However, their performance in handling
conflicting information between audio and text modalities remains largely
unexamined. This paper introduces MCR-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate how LALMs prioritize information when
presented with inconsistent audio-text pairs. Through extensive evaluation
across diverse audio understanding tasks, we reveal a concerning phenomenon:
when inconsistencies exist between modalities, LALMs display a significant bias
toward textual input, frequently disregarding audio evidence. This tendency
leads to substantial performance degradation in audio-centric tasks and raises
important reliability concerns for real-world applications. We further
investigate the influencing factors of text bias, and explore mitigation
strategies through supervised finetuning, and analyze model confidence patterns
that reveal persistent overconfidence even with contradictory inputs. These
findings underscore the need for improved modality balance during training and
more sophisticated fusion mechanisms to enhance the robustness when handling
conflicting multi-modal inputs. The project is available at

TL;DR: LLaSO 是一个开放的框架，包括数据集、基准和模型，旨在解决 LSLM 领域碎片化和缺乏透明度的问题，以加速社区研究和进展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语音语言模型（LSLM）领域由于模型架构碎片化和缺乏透明度而阻碍了研究的系统比较和可复现性。与视觉语言领域不同，LSLM 领域普遍存在发布模型权重但不发布相应训练数据和配置的做法。为了解决这些关键问题，需要一个开放的框架。

Method: LLaSO 是一个完全开放的、端到端的、大规模语音语言建模框架，包含三个核心资源：LLaSO-Align（一个包含1200万语音文本对齐实例的语料库）、LLaSO-Instruct（一个包含1350万多任务指令调优实例的数据集）和 LLaSO-Eval（一个用于标准化评估的可复现基准。此外，研究人员构建并发布了一个基于公开数据的38亿参数的 LLaSO-Base 参考模型。

Result: LLaSO-Base 模型在标准化评估中的归一化得分为 0.72，超越了同类模型，确立了一个强大的、可复现的基准。分析表明，虽然更广泛的训练覆盖范围可以提高性能，但在未见过的任务上，尤其是在纯音频场景中，仍然存在显著的泛化差距。

Conclusion: LLaSO 建立了一个基础的开放标准，用于统一研究工作并加速 LSLM 领域社区驱动的进展。

Abstract: The development of Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) has been slowed by
fragmented architectures and a lack of transparency, hindering the systematic
comparison and reproducibility of research. Unlike in the vision-language
domain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model
weights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open,
end-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides
the community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance
speech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task
instruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for
standardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release
LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public
data. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong,
reproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals
that while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant
generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio
scenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models,
LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and
accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset,
pretrained models, and results in https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLaSO.

Abstract: Recent developments in language modeling have increased their use in various
applications and domains. Language models, often trained on sensitive data, can
memorize and disclose this information during privacy attacks, raising concerns
about protecting individuals' privacy rights. Preserving privacy in language
models has become a crucial area of research, as privacy is one of the
fundamental human rights. Despite its significance, understanding of how much
privacy risk these language models possess and how it can be mitigated is still
limited. This research addresses this by providing a comprehensive study of the
privacy-preserving language modeling approaches. This study gives an in-depth
overview of these approaches, highlights their strengths, and investigates
their limitations. The outcomes of this study contribute to the ongoing
research on privacy-preserving language modeling, providing valuable insights

Motivation: 跨语言翻译中，尤其是涉及食物、服装、文化和传统词汇时，由于目标语言中不存在完全对等的词汇，常常会出现词汇不相容的问题。本研究旨在解决这一难题，提出专业翻译非等价词的方法。

Method: 本研究采用文献类研究方法。

Result: 研究总结了翻译非等价词的多种方法和规则，并成功地将25个源语言（达里语和乌兹别克语）中的非等价词翻译成了英语和俄语。

Conclusion: 该研究旨在介绍源语言到目标语言的非等价词的专业翻译方法，并提供了一些规则和方法。研究人员将25个来自达里语和乌兹别克语的非等价词翻译成了英语和俄语。

Abstract: These pure languages understanding directly relates to translation knowledge
where linguists and translators need to work and research to eradicate
misunderstanding. Misunderstandings mostly appear in non-equivalent words
because there are different local and internal words like food, garment,
cultural and traditional words and others in every notion. Truly, most of these
words do not have equivalent in the target language and these words need to be
worked and find their equivalent in the target language to fully understand the
both languages. The purpose of this research is to introduce the methods of
rendering non-equivalent words professionally from the source language to the
target language and this research has been completed using library-based
research. However, some of these non-equivalent words are already
professionally rendered to the target language but still there many other words
to be rendered. As a result, this research paper includes different ways and
rules of rendering non-equivalent words from source language to the target
language and 25 non-equvalent words have been rendered from Dar & Uzbek into
English and Russian languages.

Motivation: 为了提高可编程任务导向对话（TOD）代理在遵循结构化对话策略方面的有效性，需要准确的状态跟踪。PyTOD旨在解决这个问题。

Method: PyTOD使用语言模型而非语法规则来遵循API模式，并通过策略和执行反馈进行错误纠正，实现了一种简单的约束解码方法。

Result: PyTOD在SGD基准测试中取得了最先进的状态跟踪性能，并在准确性和稳健的用户目标估计方面超越了强基线。

Conclusion: PyTOD通过执行感知状态跟踪和基于策略与执行反馈的错误纠正，在SGD基准测试中实现了最先进的对话状态跟踪性能，并在准确性和用户目标估计方面超越了强基线。

Abstract: Programmable task-oriented dialogue (TOD) agents enable language models to
follow structured dialogue policies, but their effectiveness hinges on accurate
state tracking. We present PyTOD, an agent that generates executable code to
track dialogue state and uses policy and execution feedback for efficient error
correction. To this end, PyTOD employs a simple constrained decoding approach,
using a language model instead of grammar rules to follow API schemata. This
leads to state-of-the-art state tracking performance on the challenging SGD
benchmark. Our experiments show that PyTOD surpasses strong baselines in both
accuracy and robust user goal estimation as the dialogue progresses,
demonstrating the effectiveness of execution-aware state tracking.

TL;DR: RadReason 是一个用于放射报告的新型评估框架，可提供细粒度的分数和可解释的理由，并且在性能上可与 GPT-4 媲美。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估自动生成放射报告的方法要么产生粗略的总体分数，要么依赖于不透明的黑箱模型，这限制了它们在实际临床工作流程中的效用。因此，需要一种能够提供临床依据、可解释且细粒度的评估指标。

Method: RadReason 构建在 Group Relative Policy Optimization 之上，并结合了子分数动态加权（根据实时 F1 统计数据自适应地优先处理临床挑战性错误类型）和多数引导优势缩放（基于子分数一致性得出的提示难度调整策略梯度更新）。

Result: RadReason 不仅为六种临床定义的错误类型输出细粒度的子分数，还产生了可读性强的理由来解释每个分数的依据。

Conclusion: RadReason 在 ReXVal 基准测试中超越了所有现有的离线指标，并能与基于 GPT-4 的评估相媲美，同时保持了可解释性、成本效益和临床部署的适用性。

Abstract: Evaluating automatically generated radiology reports remains a fundamental
challenge due to the lack of clinically grounded, interpretable, and
fine-grained metrics. Existing methods either produce coarse overall scores or
rely on opaque black-box models, limiting their usefulness in real-world
clinical workflows. We introduce RadReason, a novel evaluation framework for
radiology reports that not only outputs fine-grained sub-scores across six
clinically defined error types, but also produces human-readable justifications
that explain the rationale behind each score. Our method builds on Group
Relative Policy Optimization and incorporates two key innovations: (1)
Sub-score Dynamic Weighting, which adaptively prioritizes clinically
challenging error types based on live F1 statistics; and (2) Majority-Guided
Advantage Scaling, which adjusts policy gradient updates based on prompt
difficulty derived from sub-score agreement. Together, these components enable
more stable optimization and better alignment with expert clinical judgment.
Experiments on the ReXVal benchmark show that RadReason surpasses all prior
offline metrics and achieves parity with GPT-4-based evaluations, while
remaining explainable, cost-efficient, and suitable for clinical deployment.
Code will be released upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化营销，特别是个性化优惠生成，对于提高转化率和客户满意度至关重要，现有研究表明其能显著提高收入，因此需要智能、数据驱动的方法来生成个性化优惠。

Method: SLM4Offer采用对比学习方法，通过微调Google的T5-Small（60M）预训练语言模型，并使用InfoNCE损失来优化客户画像与相关优惠在共享嵌入空间的对齐，从而生成个性化优惠。

Result: 实验结果表明，与监督微调基线相比，SLM4Offer在优惠接受率方面提高了17%，证明了对比学习目标在推进个性化营销方面的有效性。

Conclusion: SLM4Offer通过对比学习方法在个性化营销领域取得了显著成效，在模拟的客户行为和优惠接受模式的合成数据集上，与监督微调基线相比，优惠接受率提高了17%。

Abstract: Personalized marketing has emerged as a pivotal strategy for enhancing
customer engagement and driving business growth. Academic and industry efforts
have predominantly focused on recommendation systems and personalized
advertisements. Nonetheless, this facet of personalization holds significant
potential for increasing conversion rates and improving customer satisfaction.
Prior studies suggest that well-executed personalization strategies can boost
revenue by up to 40 percent, underscoring the strategic importance of
developing intelligent, data-driven approaches for offer generation. This work
introduces SLM4Offer, a generative AI model for personalized offer generation,
developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained encoder-decoder language model,
specifically Google's Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5-Small 60M) using a
contrastive learning approach. SLM4Offer employs InfoNCE (Information
Noise-Contrastive Estimation) loss to align customer personas with relevant
offers in a shared embedding space. A key innovation in SLM4Offer lies in the
adaptive learning behaviour introduced by contrastive loss, which reshapes the
latent space during training and enhances the model's generalizability. The
model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a synthetic dataset designed to simulate
customer behaviour and offer acceptance patterns. Experimental results
demonstrate a 17 percent improvement in offer acceptance rate over a supervised
fine-tuning baseline, highlighting the effectiveness of contrastive objectives
in advancing personalized marketing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出HeTLM（异质性感知训练语言模型），通过页面级分词器和聚类训练，证明小型LM在捕捉用户浏览行为“语言”方面优于大型LM，并实现了更好的用户对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑大型语言模型（LLM）在用户行为和偏好具有主观性的情况下的通用性，并提出用户行为日志可以被视为一种“语言”。研究了三个问题：(i) 小型LM是否比大型LM更能代表“浏览语言”？(ii) 单一参数集的LM是否能充分捕捉用户异构的主观行为和偏好？(iii) 平均性能高但方差大的单一LM是否会影响用户层面的对齐？

Method: 通过聚类语言模型训练（clusterwise LM training），提出HeTLM（异质性感知训练语言模型），并使用页面级分词器。

Result: 小型LM通过页面级分词器训练，优于大型LM；HeTLM（异质性感知训练语言模型）比单一LM具有更好的异质性捕捉能力；HeTLM实现了更高的平均性能和更低的性能方差，从而改善了用户层面的对齐。

Conclusion: 小型语言模型（small LM）通过页面级分词器（page-level tokenizer）训练，在代表“浏览语言”方面优于大型预训练或微调的语言模型（large LM）；HeTLM（异质性感知训练语言模型）通过异质集群特定的参数集，优于具有相同参数数量的单一语言模型；并且生成结果具有更高的平均值和更低的方差，这意味着用户层面的对齐得到了改善。

Abstract: A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks,
purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences.
We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective
behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic
browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus
generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language",
albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask:
(i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM?
(ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately
capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences?
(iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in
performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM
training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate
for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a
page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM
with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM
of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a
higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved
alignment.

TL;DR: 使用以模型为中心的难度指标（训练数据影响）进行课程学习，可显著提升语言模型预训练的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究课程学习在预训练语言模型时，使用更贴近模型训练实际的难度指标是否能提高其竞争力。

Method: 通过实验评估了使用“训练数据影响”分数而非传统以人类为中心的难度指标对模型进行排序的课程学习方法的有效性。

Result: 所提出的课程学习方法在基准测试中比随机排序的训练方法取得了超过10个百分点的优于结果。

Conclusion: 课程学习对语言模型预训练是有益的，但前提是采用更以模型为中心的难度定义。

Abstract: Curriculum learning, a training technique where data is presented to the
model in order of example difficulty (e.g., from simpler to more complex
documents), has shown limited success for pre-training language models. In this
work, we investigate whether curriculum learning becomes competitive if we
replace conventional human-centered difficulty metrics with one that more
closely corresponds to example difficulty as observed during model training.
Specifically, we experiment with sorting training examples by their
\textit{training data influence}, a score which estimates the effect of
individual training examples on the model's output. Models trained on our
curricula are able to outperform ones trained in random order by over 10
percentage points in benchmarks, confirming that curriculum learning is
beneficial for language model pre-training, as long as a more model-centric
notion of difficulty is adopted.

Result: SLM-Bench 的评估揭示了 SLM 之间存在各种权衡，一些模型在准确性方面表现出色，而另一些模型则在能源效率方面表现更优。

Conclusion: SLM-Bench 为 SLM 评估树立了新标准，弥合了资源效率与实际应用之间的差距。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) offer computational efficiency and
accessibility, yet a systematic evaluation of their performance and
environmental impact remains lacking. We introduce SLM-Bench, the first
benchmark specifically designed to assess SLMs across multiple dimensions,
including accuracy, computational efficiency, and sustainability metrics.
SLM-Bench evaluates 15 SLMs on 9 NLP tasks using 23 datasets spanning 14
domains. The evaluation is conducted on 4 hardware configurations, providing a
rigorous comparison of their effectiveness. Unlike prior benchmarks, SLM-Bench
quantifies 11 metrics across correctness, computation, and consumption,
enabling a holistic assessment of efficiency trade-offs. Our evaluation
considers controlled hardware conditions, ensuring fair comparisons across
models. We develop an open-source benchmarking pipeline with standardized
evaluation protocols to facilitate reproducibility and further research. Our
findings highlight the diverse trade-offs among SLMs, where some models excel
in accuracy while others achieve superior energy efficiency. SLM-Bench sets a
new standard for SLM evaluation, bridging the gap between resource efficiency
and real-world applicability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究介绍了 HebID，一个包含 5,536 句希伯来语政治文本的多标签语料库，用于识别十二种细微的社会身份。研究发现，经过希伯来语调优的大型语言模型在该任务上表现最佳（宏观 F1 = 0.74），并利用该语料库分析了政治话语中的身份表达及其与公众身份优先事项的比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的群体和身份检测数据集主要以英语为中心、是单标签的，并且侧重于粗略的身份类别。本研究旨在解决政治语言与社会身份交织在一起的问题，并为非英语政治背景下的社会身份检测提供支持。

Method: 创建了一个包含 5,536 句来自以色列政治家 Facebook 帖子（2018 年 12 月至 2021 年 4 月）的多标签希伯来语语料库，并手动标注了十二种细微的社会身份（例如，右翼、极度正统派、注重社会），该语料库以调查数据为基础。对多标签和单标签编码器以及参数规模从 2B 到 9B 的生成式大型语言模型进行了基准测试。

Result: 在希伯来语调优的大型语言模型在身份检测任务中取得了最佳效果（宏观 F1 分数 = 0.74）。该分类器已应用于政治家的 Facebook 帖子和议会演讲，评估了身份表达在受欢迎程度、时间趋势、聚类模式和性别相关变异方面的差异。

Conclusion: HebID 为研究希伯来语中的社会身份提供了一个全面的基础，并可作为其他非英语政治背景下类似研究的模型。

Abstract: Political language is deeply intertwined with social identities. While social
identities are often shaped by specific cultural contexts and expressed through
particular uses of language, existing datasets for group and identity detection
are predominantly English-centric, single-label and focus on coarse identity
categories. We introduce HebID, the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social
identity detection: 5,536 sentences from Israeli politicians' Facebook posts
(Dec 2018-Apr 2021), manually annotated for twelve nuanced social identities
(e.g. Rightist, Ultra-Orthodox, Socially-oriented) grounded by survey data. We
benchmark multilabel and single-label encoders alongside 2B-9B-parameter
generative LLMs, finding that Hebrew-tuned LLMs provide the best results
(macro-$F_1$ = 0.74). We apply our classifier to politicians' Facebook posts
and parliamentary speeches, evaluating differences in popularity, temporal
trends, clustering patterns, and gender-related variations in identity
expression. We utilize identity choices from a national public survey, enabling

TL;DR: Dream 7B 是一个强大的开源扩散语言模型，通过并行序列优化和创新的训练技术，在多项任务上超越了现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了开发比自回归（AR）模型更强大、能在生成过程中进行并行序列优化的开源扩散大型语言模型。

Method: 采用离散扩散建模，通过迭代去噪并行地优化序列，并结合了基于 AR 的 LLM 初始化和上下文自适应 token 级噪声重新调度等训练技术。

Result: Dream 7B 在通用、数学和编码任务上持续优于现有的扩散语言模型，并展示了出色的规划能力和推理灵活性，包括任意顺序生成、填充能力以及可调的质量-速度权衡。

Conclusion: Dream 7B 在通用、数学和编码任务上持续优于现有的扩散语言模型，并展示了出色的规划能力和推理灵活性。

Abstract: We introduce Dream 7B, the most powerful open diffusion large language model
to date. Unlike autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens sequentially,
Dream 7B employs discrete diffusion modeling to refine sequences in parallel
through iterative denoising. Our model consistently outperforms existing
diffusion language models on general, mathematical, and coding tasks. Dream 7B
demonstrates superior planning abilities and inference flexibility, including
arbitrary-order generation, infilling capabilities, and tunable quality-speed
trade-offs. These results are achieved through simple yet effective training
techniques, including AR-based LLM initialization and context-adaptive
token-level noise rescheduling. We release both Dream-Base and Dream-Instruct
to facilitate further research in diffusion-based language modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究旨在对政治非法化论述（PDD）进行大规模计算研究，以了解民主论述的动态。

Method: 本研究结合了微调编码器模型和解码器大型语言模型（LLM）的两阶段分类流程，并引入了一个名为DictaLM 2.0的模型。

Result: 研究结果显示，在过去三十年中，PDD显著增加，社交媒体上的PDD比议会辩论更普遍，男性政客比女性政客更常使用PDD，并且右翼行为者更倾向于使用PDD，在选举活动和重大的政治事件期间PDD会急剧增加。DictaLM 2.0模型在二元PDD检测方面达到了0.74的F1分数，在对非法化特征进行分类方面达到了0.67的宏观F1分数。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了自动化分析民主论述中政治非法化论述（PDD）的可行性和价值。

Abstract: We present the first large-scale computational study of political
delegitimization discourse (PDD), defined as symbolic attacks on the normative
validity of political entities. We curate and manually annotate a novel
Hebrew-language corpus of 10,410 sentences drawn from Knesset speeches
(1993-2023), Facebook posts (2018-2021), and leading news outlets, of which
1,812 instances (17.4\%) exhibit PDD and 642 carry additional annotations for
intensity, incivility, target type, and affective framing. We introduce a
two-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and
decoder LLMs. Our best model (DictaLM 2.0) attains an F$_1$ of 0.74 for binary
PDD detection and a macro-F$_1$ of 0.67 for classification of delegitimization
characteristics. Applying this classifier to longitudinal and cross-platform
data, we see a marked rise in PDD over three decades, higher prevalence on
social media versus parliamentary debate, greater use by male than female
politicians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors - with
pronounced spikes during election campaigns and major political events. Our
findings demonstrate the feasibility and value of automated PDD analysis for
understanding democratic discourse.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
requirement for reliable safety evaluation to uncover model vulnerabilities. To
this end, numerous LLM safety evaluation benchmarks are proposed. However,
existing benchmarks generally rely on labor-intensive manual curation, which
causes excessive time and resource consumption. They also exhibit significant
redundancy and limited difficulty. To alleviate these problems, we introduce
SafetyFlow, the first agent-flow system designed to automate the construction
of LLM safety benchmarks. SafetyFlow can automatically build a comprehensive
safety benchmark in only four days without any human intervention by
orchestrating seven specialized agents, significantly reducing time and

process and cost controllability while integrating human expertise into the
automatic pipeline. The final constructed dataset, SafetyFlowBench, contains
23,446 queries with low redundancy and strong discriminative power. Our
contribution includes the first fully automated benchmarking pipeline and a
comprehensive safety benchmark. We evaluate the safety of 49 advanced LLMs on
our dataset and conduct extensive experiments to validate our efficacy and
efficiency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SDGO是一种新的强化学习框架，利用LLM自身的鉴别能力来提高其安全性，防止有害内容生成，并能有效防御越狱攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在生成有害内容方面容易受到越狱攻击，但其作为判别器的鉴别能力却更强。这一安全不一致性促使研究者探索如何对齐模型的内在鉴别和生成能力。

Method: 提出了一种名为SDGO（Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization）的强化学习框架，该框架利用模型自身的鉴别能力作为奖励信号，通过迭代自我完善来增强生成安全性。

Result: 实验证明，SDGO显著提高了模型安全性，并能有效防御OOD越狱攻击。该方法实现了LLM鉴别能力和生成能力之间更紧密的耦合，仅需少量鉴别性样本即可进一步增强模型的生成能力。

Conclusion: SDGO通过对其自身鉴别能力的利用，通过迭代自我完善来增强生成安全性。该方法在训练阶段不需要任何额外的标注数据或外部模型。SDGO显著提高了模型的安全性，同时在通用基准上保持了有用性，并能有效防御OOD越狱攻击。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing
tasks but remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that induce harmful content
generation. In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can
more effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend
against them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the
model's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we
propose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement
learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities
as a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative
self-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or
external models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and
training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks.
By aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings
robust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This
alignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling
the model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small
amount of discriminative samples. Our code and datasets are available at
https://github.com/NJUNLP/SDGO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The manual creation of scientific survey articles is becoming infeasible due to the rapid growth of academic literature, creating a need for automated solutions.

Method: Introduced SurGE benchmark (test instances with topic descriptions, expert surveys, references, and academic corpus) and an automated evaluation framework assessing information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and content quality.

Result: Evaluations of LLM-based approaches showed that survey generation remains a challenging task, even for advanced self-reflection frameworks.

Conclusion: SurGE benchmark and evaluation framework demonstrate that automated scientific survey generation is challenging for current LLMs, necessitating further research.

Abstract: Scientific survey articles play a vital role in summarizing research
progress, yet their manual creation is becoming increasingly infeasible due to
the rapid growth of academic literature. While large language models (LLMs)
offer promising capabilities for automating this process, progress in this area
is hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols.
To address this gap, we introduce SurGE (Survey Generation Evaluation), a new
benchmark for evaluating scientific survey generation in the computer science
domain. SurGE consists of (1) a collection of test instances, each including a
topic description, an expert-written survey, and its full set of cited
references, and (2) a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers
that serves as the retrieval pool. In addition, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that measures generated surveys across four dimensions:
information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and
content quality. Our evaluation of diverse LLM-based approaches shows that
survey generation remains highly challenging, even for advanced self-reflection
frameworks. These findings highlight the complexity of the task and the
necessity for continued research. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and
models at: https://github.com/oneal2000/SurGE

Motivation: 位置偏差（PB）显著降低了长上下文理解和处理能力，现有方法未能有效解决。

Method: Pos2Distill是一个位置到位置的知识蒸馏框架，通过将有利位置的能力转移到不利位置来减少位置偏差。针对检索和推理范式，设计了Pos2Distill-R¹和Pos2Distill-R²。

Result: Pos2Distill方法在长上下文检索和推理任务中显著提升了所有上下文位置的均匀性和性能，并且其专门的系统在各自的任务上表现优越，同时具有良好的跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: Pos2Distill框架通过知识蒸馏，将长上下文理解中的位置偏差（PB）从有利位置转移到不利位置，有效提升了在检索和推理任务中的性能和位置均匀性。该方法具有良好的跨任务泛化能力。

Abstract: Positional bias (PB), manifesting as non-uniform sensitivity across different
contextual locations, significantly impairs long-context comprehension and
processing capabilities. While prior work seeks to mitigate PB through
modifying the architectures causing its emergence, significant PB still
persists. To address PB effectively, we introduce \textbf{Pos2Distill}, a
position to position knowledge distillation framework. Pos2Distill transfers
the superior capabilities from advantageous positions to less favorable ones,
thereby reducing the huge performance gaps. The conceptual principle is to
leverage the inherent, position-induced disparity to counteract the PB itself.
We identify distinct manifestations of PB under \textbf{\textsc{r}}etrieval and
\textbf{\textsc{r}}easoning paradigms, thereby designing two specialized
instantiations: \emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{1}} and
\emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{2}} respectively, both grounded in this
core principle. By employing the Pos2Distill approach, we achieve enhanced
uniformity and significant performance gains across all contextual positions in
long-context retrieval and reasoning tasks. Crucially, both specialized systems
exhibit strong cross-task generalization mutually, while achieving superior
performance on their respective tasks.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Bangla, the seventh most widely spoken language worldwide with 300 million
native speakers, faces digital under-representation due to limited resources
and lack of annotated datasets. Stemming, a critical preprocessing step in
language analysis, is essential for low-resource, highly-inflectional languages
like Bangla, because it can reduce the complexity of algorithms and models by
significantly reducing the number of words the algorithm needs to consider.
This paper conducts a comprehensive survey of stemming approaches, emphasizing
the importance of handling morphological variants effectively. While exploring
the landscape of Bangla stemming, it becomes evident that there is a
significant gap in the existing literature. The paper highlights the
discontinuity from previous research and the scarcity of accessible
implementations for replication. Furthermore, it critiques the evaluation
methodologies, stressing the need for more relevant metrics. In the context of
Bangla's rich morphology and diverse dialects, the paper acknowledges the
challenges it poses. To address these challenges, the paper suggests directions
for Bangla stemmer development. It concludes by advocating for robust Bangla
stemmers and continued research in the field to enhance language analysis and
processing.

*Xinyi Ling,Hanwen Du,Zhihui Zhu,Xia Ning*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 电子商务平台拥有丰富的多模态数据，但图像并不总能提升产品理解能力。本文提出了 EcomMMMU 数据集和 SUMEI 方法，用于评估和改进 MLLM 在电子商务任务中利用视觉内容的能力。SUMEI 通过预测视觉效用，能够有效利用多个图像，并在实验中表现出有效性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子商务平台拥有丰富的多模态数据，其中包含描绘产品细节的各种图像。然而，一个关键问题是这些图像是否总能增强对产品的理解，或者它们是否可能引入冗余或降低性能。现有的数据集在规模和设计上都有限，使得系统地检验这个问题变得困难。

Method: 提出了一种名为 SUMEI 的数据驱动方法，该方法通过预测视觉效用并利用其对多个图像进行策略性利用，以应对 MLLM 在电子商务任务中利用视觉内容所面临的挑战。

Result: EcomMMMU 数据集包含 406,190 个样本和 8,989,510 张图像，其中包含多图像视觉-语言数据，并设计了 8 项基本任务和一个专门的 VSS 子集，用于评估 MLLM 有效利用视觉内容的能力。分析表明，产品图像并不总能改善性能，有时甚至会降低性能。

Conclusion: 产品图像并不总能改善性能，有时甚至会降低性能，这表明 MLLM 可能难以有效利用丰富的视觉内容来完成电子商务任务。SUMEI 是一种数据驱动的方法，通过在将多个图像用于下游任务之前预测其视觉效用，来对其进行策略性利用。

Abstract: E-commerce platforms are rich in multimodal data, featuring a variety of
images that depict product details. However, this raises an important question:
do these images always enhance product understanding, or can they sometimes
introduce redundancy or degrade performance? Existing datasets are limited in
both scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine this
question. To this end, we introduce EcomMMMU, an e-commerce multimodal
multitask understanding dataset with 406,190 samples and 8,989,510 images.
EcomMMMU is comprised of multi-image visual-language data designed with 8
essential tasks and a specialized VSS subset to benchmark the capability of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively utilize visual content.
Analysis on EcomMMMU reveals that product images do not consistently improve
performance and can, in some cases, degrade it. This indicates that MLLMs may
struggle to effectively leverage rich visual content for e-commerce tasks.
Building on these insights, we propose SUMEI, a data-driven method that
strategically utilizes multiple images via predicting visual utilities before
using them for downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SUMEI. The data and code are available through
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/submission25.

TL;DR: Deep-DxSearch uses RL to train an agentic RAG system for medical diagnosis, outperforming other methods by improving knowledge use and reasoning traceability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical LLMs struggle with knowledge gaps and hallucinations, and while retrieval-augmented methods offer improvements, they suffer from weak external knowledge utilization and poor feedback-reasoning traceability. Deep-DxSearch aims to address these challenges.

Method: Deep-DxSearch is an agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that employs end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL). It constructs a large-scale medical retrieval corpus (patient records, medical knowledge) and frames the LLM as an agent interacting with this corpus as its environment. Tailored rewards for format, retrieval, reasoning structure, and diagnostic accuracy are used to train the agentic RAG policy.

Result: Experiments show Deep-DxSearch consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches. It achieves substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong baselines like GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 for both common and rare disease diagnosis under various settings. Ablation studies confirm the importance of reward design and retrieval corpus components. Case studies and interpretability analyses highlight improved diagnostic policies and clinician support.

Conclusion: Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained with reinforcement learning, demonstrates significant improvements in medical diagnosis accuracy by effectively utilizing external knowledge and providing traceable reasoning, outperforming existing baselines in both common and rare disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by
knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help,
but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor
feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce
Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement
learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for
medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical
retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge
sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More
crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its
environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,
and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from
large-scale data through RL.
  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework
consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches
across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic
baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks
for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and
out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and
retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the
uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional
implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight
improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight
into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more
reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses. See

Method: 提出ReasonZoo基准，包含九种推理类别，并引入PAC和AUC-PCC两个新指标评估推理效率。

Result: TIR模型在数学和非数学任务中表现优于非TIR模型，且PAC和AUC-PCC指标显示TIR能提升推理效率。

Conclusion: TIR在数学和非数学任务中均优于非TIR模型，并能提升推理效率，减少过度思考，使推理更简洁。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning tasks
through methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they often fall
short in tasks requiring precise computations. Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR)
has emerged as a solution by incorporating external tools into the reasoning
process. Nevertheless, the generalization of TIR in improving the reasoning
ability of LLM is still unclear. Additionally, whether TIR has improved the
model's reasoning behavior and helped the model think remains to be studied. We
introduce ReasonZoo, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing nine diverse
reasoning categories, to evaluate the effectiveness of TIR across various
domains. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics, Performance-Aware Cost
(PAC) and Area Under the Performance-Cost Curve (AUC-PCC), to assess reasoning
efficiency. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that TIR-enabled models
consistently outperform their non-TIR counterparts in both mathematical and
non-mathematical tasks. Furthermore, TIR enhances reasoning efficiency, as
evidenced by improved PAC and AUC-PCC, indicating reduced overthinking and more
streamlined reasoning. These findings underscore the domain-general benefits of
TIR and its potential to advance LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: LiveMCP-101 benchmark sets a rigorous standard for evaluating real-world agent capabilities and advances toward autonomous AI systems that reliably execute complex tasks through tool use.

Abstract: Tool calling has emerged as a critical capability for AI agents to interact
with the real world and solve complex tasks. While the Model Context Protocol
(MCP) provides a powerful standardized framework for tool integration, there is
a significant gap in benchmarking how well AI agents can effectively solve
multi-step tasks using diverse MCP tools in realistic, dynamic scenarios. In
this work, we present LiveMCP-101, a benchmark of 101 carefully curated
real-world queries, refined through iterative LLM rewriting and manual review,
that require coordinated use of multiple MCP tools including web search, file
operations, mathematical reasoning, and data analysis. Moreover, we introduce a
novel evaluation approach that leverages ground-truth execution plans rather
than raw API outputs, better reflecting the evolving nature of real-world
environments. Experiments show that even frontier LLMs achieve a success rate
below 60\%, highlighting major challenges in tool orchestration. Detailed
ablations and error analysis further reveal distinct failure modes and
inefficiencies in token usage, pointing to concrete directions for advancing
current models. LiveMCP-101 sets a rigorous standard for evaluating real-world

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个数值模型来描述金属泡沫的热行为，发现几何特征和Guyer-Krumhansl方程对模拟结果很重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金属泡沫由于其低密度和大的比表面积，越来越多地被用作结合了优异结构和热性能的细胞材料。然而，其内部传热过程复杂，传导、对流和辐射同时存在，使得建模具有挑战性。

Method: 开发了一个一维、瞬态、离散数值模型，用于描述金属泡沫的有效热行为。该模型考虑了固相传导、闭腔传导、孔壁辐射以及腔体旁路传导。

Result: 结果表明，几何特征（如孔隙大小和排列）对温度分布有显著影响。经典的基于傅立叶的模型不适用于多孔材料，而Guyer-Krumhansl方程则是一个合适的选择。此外，研究还得到了静态和动态热扩散率与金属泡沫参数的关系，并证明了其对孔隙热特性具有显著的敏感性。

Conclusion: 由于孔隙尺寸和排列等几何特征对温度分布有显著影响，并且经典的基于傅立叶的模型不适用于多孔材料，但Guyer-Krumhansl方程是一个合适的候选者。此外，我们发现静态和动态热扩散率与金属泡沫参数相关，并且对腔体的热特性表现出显著敏感性。

Abstract: Due to their low density and large specific surface area, metal foams are
increasingly used as cellular materials that combine excellent structural and
thermal properties. Their cellular structure makes them particularly suitable
for use in heat exchangers, insulation, and fire protection layers. The heat
transport that takes place within them is a complex phenomenon characterized by
the simultaneous presence of heat conduction, heat transfer, and heat
radiation, making their modeling a significant challenge. The aim of the
research is to develop a one-dimensional, time-dependent, discrete numerical
model capable of describing the effective thermal behavior of metal foams. The
model takes into account heat conduction through the solid phase, conductive
heat transfer in the closed cavities, thermal radiation between the pore walls,
and by-passing heat conduction around the cavity. The results highlight that
geometric features such as cavity size and arrangement have a significant
impact on temperature distribution and confirm that classical Fourier-based
models are not accurately applicable to porous materials, but the
Guyer--Krumhansl equation is an adequate candidate. Furthermore, we correlated
the static and dynamic thermal diffusivity with the metal foam parameters,
showing a significant sensitivity to the cavity thermal attributes.

Result: 在一维临界系统附近，量子度量和平均局域化长度成正比，并且都由费米能量周围杂化局域化态的性质决定。在键无序的SSH链中，电磁化率的行为与前两者截然不同，即使在局域化长度和量子度量有限的情况下也可能发散，这导致了一种新的兼具金属和绝缘体特性的超电介质状态。研究证明了这种超电介质相也存在于更高维度的材料中。

Conclusion: 这项研究揭示了在包含杂质共振的一维安德森绝缘体模型和SSH链中，量子度量、平均局域化长度和电磁化率之间的关系。研究表明，量子度量和平均局域化长度在一维临界系统附近成正比，并由费米能量周围杂化局域化态的性质决定。该研究还发现，在SSH链的键无序情况下，电磁化率的行为会发生巨大变化，即使在局域化长度和量子度量有限的情况下也可能发散。这种由特定能量下的杂质共振增殖引起的发散，形成了一种新的兼具金属和绝缘体特性的超电介质状态。研究最后指出，这种超电介质相也存在于更高维度的材料中，如具有空位和凯勒键畸变的石墨烯。

Abstract: We study the relationship between the quantities that encode the insulating
properties of matter: the ground-state quantum metric, the average localization
length, and the electric susceptibility. By examining the one-dimensional
Anderson insulator model and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain with chiral
disorder, we demonstrate that the former two measures are proportional in
one-dimensional systems near criticality, and both are determined by the
properties of the hybridized localized states around the Fermi energy. We
employ these insights to demonstrate that the behavior of the electric
susceptibility is drastically different in the bond-disordered SSH chain, with
the possibility that it may diverge even when the localization length and the
quantum metric remain finite. This divergence, caused by the proliferation of
impurity resonances at a particular energy, leads to a novel regime that
exhibits mixed characteristics of metals and insulators. We term this regime
superdielectric: an insulating state characterized by a finite quantum metric
and divergent static electric susceptibility, which implies perfect screening
in the absence of the dc conductivity. We demonstrate that the superdielectric
phase also emerges in higher-dimensional materials, such as graphene with
vacancies and Kekul\'e bond distortion.

Motivation: 本研究旨在探讨塞贝克系数(S)与每粒子差分熵(s)之间的关系，以作为表征二维系统中电荷载流子的工具。

Method: 使用扶手椅状硅纳米带作为模型平台，分析了在室温下，塞贝克系数(S)和每粒子差分熵(s)如何以及它们的比率如何依赖于化学势。

Result: 研究发现在带隙能量区域内，S和s具有高度的相互关联性，并且它们的比率s/S在整个能量窗口内收敛于基本电荷e，满足开尔文公式S=s/e。相反，对于无间隙的 the ribbon，s/S在第一个传输通道的能量窗口内是未定义的。

Conclusion: 该研究结果表明，差分熵与塞贝克系数的比率是确定基本电荷和识别电子带隙洁净度的可靠且互补的探针，因为s/S与e相匹配。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the relationship between the Seebeck coefficient
$(S)$, and the differential entropy per particle (DEP, $s$), as a tool for
characterizing charge carriers in two-dimensional systems. Using armchair
silicene nanoribbons as a model platform, we analyze how both quantities and
their ratio depend on chemical potential at room temperature. While the Seebeck
coefficient captures transport properties through the energy dependence of the
electronic transmission, the DEP is directly connected to the system's
electronic entropy, offering a direct thermodynamic alternative for estimating
$S$. We evaluate these transport-thermodynamic properties considering diverse
ribbon widths, defining metallic and semiconducting regimes. We find both
quantities $S$ and $s$, are highly interconnected within the ribbon's band gap
energy region, and their ratio $s/S$ converges to the elementary charge $e$
across that energy window, fulfilling the Kelvin formula $S=s/e$. On the
contrary, $s/S$ is undefined for gapless ribbons in the energy window of the
first transmission channel. These results establish the ratio between the DEP
and the Seebeck coefficient as a reliable and complementary probe for the
determination of the elementary charge, and to identify the cleanness of
electronic band gaps as $s/S$ matches with $e$.

Result: 所提出的弯曲纳米带结构能够产生高达100%的GAMC，并且通过进一步弯曲或调整弯曲角度，GAMC可以提升至200%、300%甚至更高。该现象在宽泛的费米能量范围内保持稳定，在弱磁场和室温下即可观察，并适用于二维电子气（2DEG）和石墨烯等多种系统。

Conclusion: 该研究理论上证明了弯曲纳米带在磁场作用下，可以根据磁场方向选择性地产生体、界面和边缘磁态，并由此产生强的几何诱导各向异性磁导（GAMC）。

Abstract: When a nanoribbon is bent under a homogeneous external magnetic field, the
effective magnetic field inside becomes either homogeneous or inhomogeneous,
depending on the direction of the field. This enables the selective creation of
bulk, interface, and edge magnetic states in the bent structure, for a magnetic
field with a strength. We establish theoretically that these tuneable states
lead to a strong geometry-induced anisotropic magnetoconductance (GAMC) in
perpendicularly bent nanoribbon, which can reach up to 100\%. Moreover, the
GAMC can be further enhanced to 200\%, 300\%, or even higher by either further
bending or tuning the bending angle. The potential of this phenomenon for
practical applications is demonstrated by its stable anisotropy, which remains
consistent across a wide range of Fermi energies, can be observed even at weak
magnetic fields and room temperature, and occurs in various systems such as
two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) and graphene.

TL;DR: ZrTe5中的异常霍尔效应源于量子效应和无序的相互作用，其行为在不同磁场区域表现出从线性到1/B的转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异常霍尔效应（AHE）通常与铁磁材料中的时间反转对称性破缺有关，但最近在非磁性拓扑材料中也观察到了该效应，这引发了对其起源的疑问。

Method: 利用朗道能级框架中的久保-斯塔达公式，研究了磁场（B）和无序引起的量子效用在半经典和量子区域的相互作用。

Result: 在半经典区域，霍尔电阻率在磁场中保持线性，但霍尔系数会因量子几何效应和电子-空穴相干性而重新归一化。在量子极限区域，霍尔电导率表现出未饱和的1/B标度。横向电导率在超量子极限下主导传输，霍尔电阻率从B依赖性变为B^{-1}依赖性。

Conclusion: 该研究阐明了ZrTe5中异常霍尔效应的机制，并为其他非磁性狄拉克材料中的异常霍尔效应提供了见解。

Abstract: The anomalous Hall effect (AHE), conventionally associated with time-reversal
symmetry breaking in ferromagnetic materials, has recently been observed in
nonmagnetic topological materials, raising questions about its origin. We
unravel the unconventional Hall response in the nonmagnetic Dirac material
ZrTe5, known for its massive Dirac bands and unique electronic and transport
properties. Using the Kubo-Streda formula within the Landau level framework, we
explore the interplay of quantum effects induced by the magnetic field (B) and
disorder across the semiclassical and quantum regimes. In the semiclassical
regime, the Hall resistivity remains linear in the magnetic field, but the Hall
coefficient will be renormalized by the quantum geometric effects and
electron-hole coherence, especially at low carrier densities where the disorder
scattering dominates. In quantum limit, the Hall conductivity exhibits an
unsaturating 1/B scaling. As a result, the transverse conductivity dominates
transport in the ultra-quantum limit, and the Hall resistivity crosses over
from B to B^{-1} dependence as the system transitions from the semiclassical
regime to the quantum limit. This work elucidates the mechanisms underlying the
unconventional Hall effect in ZrTe5 and provides insights into the AHE in other
nonmagnetic Dirac materials as well.

Result: 莫比乌斯几何结构表现出与反传播自旋波相关的非简并模式双峰，这与平凡情况下的驻波双峰形成对比。这种分裂源于扭曲引起的几何（贝里）相位，该相位破坏了传播对称性，产生了非倒置的色散关系。莫比乌斯拓扑结构进一步引入了反对称边界条件，导致半整数波长量子化。通过局域射频激发可以有选择地产生具有确定频率和方向的自旋波。一个分析模型以高度一致的方式再现了色散行为。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，通过几何和拓扑设计可以优化三维磁子系统中的自旋波传输。

Abstract: Curved and topologically nontrivial magnetic structures offer new pathways to
control spin-wave behavior beyond planar geometries. Here, we study spin-wave
dynamics in M\"obius-shaped soft-magnetic nanostrips using micromagnetic
simulations. By comparing single-, double-, and triple-twisted M\"obius strips
to a topologically trivial bent ring, we isolate the roles of helical twist and
non-orientable topology. M\"obius geometries exhibit non-degenerate mode
doublets associated with counterpropagating spin waves, in contrast to the
standing-wave doublets in the trivial case. This splitting arises from a
twist-induced geometric (Berry) phase that breaks propagation symmetry,
producing non-reciprocal dispersion relations. The M\"obius topology further
imposes antisymmetric boundary conditions, resulting in half-integer wavelength
quantization. Local RF excitation allows for the selective generation of spin
waves with defined frequency and direction. An analytical model reproduces the
dispersion behavior with excellent agreement. These results highlight how
geometric and topological design can be leveraged to engineer spin-wave
transport in three-dimensional magnonic systems.

Conclusion: 本研究提出了利用霍尔电压信号实时追踪磁极子的运动，为基于磁极子的传感器、计数器和非常规计算系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions, topologically stabilized spin textures, are promising
candidates for future memory devices and non-conventional computing
applications due to their enhanced stability, non-linear interactions, and
low-power manipulation capabilities. Despite their significant potential, the
reliable electrical readout of individual skyrmions remains a fundamental
challenge. While magnetic tunnel junctions and anomalous-Hall-effect-based
techniques have demonstrated skyrmion detection capabilities, they currently
fail to reliably detect single moving skyrmions as required for applications.
Our approach leverages thermally activated skyrmions, where a low constant
drive current simultaneously generates both skyrmion motion and the Hall
voltage necessary for detection. We demonstrate the reliability of this method
through real-time correlation between measured Hall voltage signals and direct
Kerr microscopy imaging. Two consecutive Hall crosses allow for determining the
skyrmion velocity, in accordance to Kerr microscopy videos. These advances
establish a robust platform for skyrmion-based sensors, counters and
unconventional computing systems that depend on precise individual skyrmion
control and detection.

Abstract: We provide a framework for optimizing energy conversion processes in coherent
quantum conductors fed by nonthermal resources. Such nonthermal resources,
which cannot be characterized by temperatures or electrochemical potentials,
occur in small-scale systems that are smaller than their thermalization length.
Using scattering theory in combination with a Lagrange multiplier method, we
optimize the device's performance based on the efficiency, precision, or a
trade-off between the two at a given output current. The transmission
properties leading to this optimal performance are identified. We showcase our
findings with the example of a refrigerator exploiting experimentally relevant
nonthermal resources, which could result from competing environments or from
light irradiation. We show that the performance is improved compared to a
device exploiting a thermal resource. Our results can serve as guidelines for
the design of energy-conversion processes in future nanoelectronic devices.

Method: 通过改变石墨烯的封装条件和掺杂情况来研究外场对多层石墨烯二次谐波（SHG）信号的影响。

Result: 发现红外波段存在堆叠顺序的指纹，并且四层石墨烯的SHG响应比三层石墨烯大。四层石墨烯在太赫兹波段的SHG信号对环境敏感，掺杂会抑制SHG信号。

Conclusion: SHG信号的测量需要光谱方法来识别堆叠顺序，因为在中心对称多层石墨烯中，环境因素可以诱导SHG信号。

Abstract: In this work, we analyze the effects of external influences on the second
harmonic generation (SHG) signal produced by multilayer graphenes.
Specifically, we vary the encapsulation conditions and doping of graphenes,
seeking to identify SHG "fingerprints" that are unsensitive to external
perturbations. We identify characteristic features in the infrared regime that
may be used as a stacking-order fingerprint for the mixed stacking tetralayer
and the trilayer polytypes caused by a strong double resonance effect. Further
to this, we find that the tetralayers systematically produce an SHG response
that is significantly larger as compared to the trilayers. We then studied the
SHG signal by the tetralayer polytypes in the terahertz regime and demonstrated
the signal is highly sensitive the environmental conditions. Furthermore, we
also find that accidental doping of graphene will strongly suppress the SHG
signal in this regime. The above findings emphasize the need for a spectral
approach to the identification of stacking order by SHG. Thus, measurements at
one frequency are insufficient to confidently identify the stacking order due
to the environmental sensitivities, since SHG can be readily induced with a
comparable magnitude in the centrosymmetric polytypes through external
symmetry-breaking.

TL;DR: The study shows that junctions between altermagnets and p-wave magnets can generate transverse spin currents due to crystallographic orientation and spin structure, offering a new platform for controlling spin currents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Studying charge and spin transport across a junction between an altermagnet and a p-wave magnet.

Method: Using a continuum model with boundary conditions tailored to the spin-split band structures of the altermagnet and p-wave magnet.

Result: The junction supports finite longitudinal and transverse spin currents, even though neither material is spin-polarized. Transverse conductivities can be finite and even dominant over longitudinal ones, originating from the matching/mismatching of transverse momentum modes and spin-dependent band splitting. Transverse spin conductivity remains finite due to unequal contributions of opposite k_y channels.

Conclusion: altermagnet/p-wave magnet junctions are a promising platform for tunable generation and control of transverse charge and spin currents driven purely by crystallographic orientation and spin structure.

Abstract: We study charge and spin transport across a junction between an altermagnet
(AM) and a $p$-wave magnet (PM) using a continuum model with boundary
conditions tailored to the spin-split band structures of the two materials.
Remarkably, although neither AM nor PM is spin-polarized, we find that the
junction supports finite spin currents both longitudinally and transversely. We
compute the longitudinal and transverse charge and spin conductivities as
functions of the crystallographic orientations and the relative angle between
the N\'eel vectors of AM and PM. Our results reveal that transverse charge and
spin conductivities can be finite even when the longitudinal charge
conductivity vanishes. For suitable parameter choices and orientation angles,
the transverse conductivities are more prominent than the longitudinal ones.
The origin of these effects lies in the matching and mismatching of transverse
momentum modes ($k_y$) across the junction combined with the spin-dependent
band splitting in AM and PM. Furthermore, while the transverse charge
conductivity may cancel for certain orientations, the transverse spin
conductivity remains finite due to unequal contributions of opposite $k_y$
channels. These findings highlight altermagnet/$p$-wave magnet junctions as a
promising platform for tunable generation and control of transverse charge and
spin currents driven purely by crystallographic orientation and spin structure.

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions forming two-dimensional (2D) lattices provide a versatile
platform for investigating phase transitions predicted by
Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory. While 2D melting in
skyrmion systems has been demonstrated, achieving controlled ordering in
skyrmion lattices remains challenging due to pinning effects from a non-uniform
energy landscape, which often results in polycrystalline structures. Skyrmions
in thin films, however, offer thermal diffusion with high tunability and can be
directly imaged via Kerr microscopy, enabling real-time observation of their
dynamics. To regulate lattice order in such flexible systems, we introduce
geometric confinements of varying shapes. Combining Kerr microscopy experiments
with Thiele model simulations, we demonstrate that confinement geometry
critically influences lattice order. Specifically, hexagonal confinements
commensurate with the skyrmion lattice stabilize monodomain hexagonal ordering,
while incommensurate geometries induce domain formation and reduce overall
order. Understanding these boundary-driven effects is essential for advancing
the study of 2D phase behavior and for the design of skyrmion-based spintronic
applications, ranging from memory devices to unconventional computing
architectures.

models as hierarchies of lightweight processes ("streams") scheduled in
deterministic layers that read and write a shared context, making cross-scale
couplings explicit and auditable. A compact API and CLI-simulate, optimize,
evaluate-expose single- and multi-objective evolution, PyTorch policy
integration via parameter flattening/unflattening, and general tournament
tooling with user-defined scoring and voting rules. The framework standardizes
evaluation through uniform per-step and episode metrics, persists seeds,
logbooks, and hall-of-fame archives, and provides plotting helpers for traces,
Pareto fronts, and comparative outcomes, reducing glue code and improving
comparability across studies. HEAS emphasizes separation of mechanism from
orchestration, allowing exogenous drivers, endogenous agents, and aggregators
to be composed and swapped without refactoring, while the same model can be
used for forward simulation, optimization, or systematic comparison. We
illustrate usage with two compact examples-an ecological system and an
enterprise decision-making setting. HEAS offers a practical foundation for
cross-disciplinary, multi-level inquiry, yielding reliable, reproducible
results.

Abstract: Modern distributed data processing systems face significant challenges in
balancing system performance with code maintainability and developer
productivity, particularly when integrating machine learning capabilities at
scale. In large collaborative environments, these challenges are amplified by
high communication overhead between teams and the complexity of coordinating
development across multiple groups. This paper presents a novel "Declarative
Data Pipeline" architecture that addresses these challenges while processing
billions of records with high accuracy and efficiency. Our architecture
introduces a modular framework that seamlessly integrates machine learning
capabilities within Apache Spark by combining logical computation units that we
refer as Pipes, departing from traditional microservice-based approaches. By
establishing clear component boundaries and standardized interfaces, we achieve
both modularity and system optimization without sacrificing maintainability.
The enterprise case study demonstrate substantial improvements in multiple
dimensions: development efficiency improved by 50%,
collaboration/troubleshooting efforts compressed from weeks to days,
performance improved by 500x in scalability and by 10x in throughput. The
academic experiment also proves at least 5.7x faster in throughput with 99% CPU
utilization than non-framework implementations. This paper details the
architectural decisions, implementation strategies, and performance
optimizations that enable these improvements, providing insights for building
scalable, maintainable data processing systems that effectively balance system
performance with development velocity.

### [138] [Databelt: A Continuous Data Path for Serverless Workflows in the 3D Compute Continuum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15351)
*Cynthia Marcelino,Leonard Guelmino,Thomas Pusztai,Stefan Nastic*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Databelt是一个为3D计算连续体等动态环境设计的无服务器工作流状态管理框架，通过优化的状态传播和融合机制，显著提高了性能并降低了延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的无服务器函数依赖远程存储服务管理状态，导致延迟和网络开销增加。在3D（边缘-云-空间）计算连续体等动态环境中，由于网络拓扑频繁变化，函数需要多次跳转才能访问云服务，增加了状态访问延迟和不必要的数据传输。

Method: Databelt框架通过引入感知服务等级协议（SLO）的状态传播机制，使函数状态能够持续在轨道上传播，并将函数状态预先卸载到最合适的节点。此外，还提出了一种函数状态融合机制，用于对共享相同无服务器运行时的函数的状态管理进行抽象，实现对函数状态的聚合检索。

Result: 实验结果表明，Databelt将工作流执行时间缩短高达66%，吞吐量提高50%。同时，Databelt函数状态融合机制通过减少同一运行时内函数的重复存储请求，将存储操作延迟降低高达20%。

Conclusion: Databelt通过其感知服务等级协议（SLO）的状态传播机制和函数状态融合机制，有效解决了3D计算连续体等动态环境中无服务器工作流的状态管理挑战。实验证明，Databelt能将工作流执行时间缩短高达66%，吞吐量提高50%，并显著降低存储操作延迟。

Abstract: Typically, serverless functions rely on remote storage services for managing
state, which can result in increased latency and network communication
overhead. In a dynamic environment such as the 3D (Edge-Cloud-Space) Compute
Continuum, serverless functions face additional challenges due to frequent
changes in network topology. As satellites move in and out of the range of
ground stations, functions must make multiple hops to access cloud services,
leading to high-latency state access and unnecessary data transfers. In this
paper, we present Databelt, a state management framework for serverless
workflows designed for the dynamic environment of the 3D Compute Continuum.
Databelt introduces an SLO-aware state propagation mechanism that enables the
function state to move continuously in orbit. Databelt proactively offloads
function states to the most suitable node, such that when functions execute,
the data is already present on the execution node or nearby, thus minimizing
state access latency and reducing the number of network hops. Additionally,
Databelt introduces a function state fusion mechanism that abstracts state
management for functions sharing the same serverless runtime. When functions
are fused, Databelt seamlessly retrieves their state as a group, reducing
redundant network and storage operations and improving overall workflow
efficiency. Our experimental results show that Databelt reduces workflow
execution time by up to 66% and increases throughput by 50% compared to the
baselines. Furthermore, our results show that Databelt function state fusion
reduces storage operations latency by up to 20%, by reducing repetitive storage
requests for functions within the same runtime, ensuring efficient execution of
serverless workflows in highly dynamic network environments such as the 3D
Continuum.

### [139] [Universal Dancing by Luminous Robots under Sequential Schedulers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15484)
*Caterina Feletti,Paola Flocchini,Debasish Pattanayak,Giuseppe Prencipe,Nicola Santoro*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper shows that robots with lights of different colors (LUMI model) and a sequential scheduler can solve the Dancing problem without previous restrictions. The length of choreographies is limited by the number of colors. An algorithm using a distributed counter is proposed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether crucial restrictions on choreographies and initial configurations, proven necessary for solving the Dancing problem under certain robot models, can be dropped by considering the LUMI model (robots with lights of different colors) under a sequential scheduler.

Method: The paper proves that necessary constraints on choreographies and initial configurations for the Dancing problem can be dropped under the LUMI model with a sequential scheduler. It formalizes the Universal Dancing problem and provides an algorithm that implements a distributed counter mechanism.

Result: The paper proves that the length of feasible choreographies is bounded by the compositions of n into the number of colors available. An algorithm is provided that solves the Universal Dancing problem, ensuring spatial homogeneity of the performed choreography.

Conclusion: The length of feasible choreographies for the Universal Dancing problem under the LUMI model with a sequential scheduler is bounded by the compositions of n into the number of available colors. An algorithm is provided to solve this problem by utilizing a distributed counter mechanism, ensuring spatial homogeneity even with non-rigid movements.

Abstract: The Dancing problem requires a swarm of $n$ autonomous mobile robots to form
a sequence of patterns, aka perform a choreography. Existing work has proven
that some crucial restrictions on choreographies and initial configurations
(e.g., on repetitions of patterns, periodicity, symmetries,
contractions/expansions) must hold so that the Dancing problem can be solved
under certain robot models. Here, we prove that these necessary constraints can
be dropped by considering the LUMI model (i.e., where robots are endowed with a
light whose color can be chosen from a constant-size palette) under the quite
unexplored sequential scheduler. We formalize the class of Universal Dancing
problems which require a swarm of $n$ robots starting from any initial
configuration to perform a (periodic or finite) sequence of arbitrary patterns,
only provided that each pattern consists of $n$ vertices (including
multiplicities). However, we prove that, to be solvable under LUMI, the length
of the feasible choreographies is bounded by the compositions of $n$ into the
number of colors available to the robots. We provide an algorithm solving the
Universal Dancing problem by exploiting the peculiar capability of sequential
robots to implement a distributed counter mechanism. Even assuming non-rigid
movements, our algorithm ensures spatial homogeneity of the performed
choreography.

*Pierre Fraigniaud,Minh Hang Nguyen,Ami Paz,Ulrich Schmid,Hugo Rincon Galeana*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 该研究为存在进程崩溃和任意通信网络的同步k-集协议问题提供了新的拓扑下界，并推广了先前已有的相关结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究旨在为同步消息传递系统中的k-集协议问题提供一个新的、更通用的下界，特别是在存在进程崩溃和任意网络拓扑的情况下。现有研究的下界在网络拓扑和进程崩溃模型方面存在局限性，因此需要更广泛适用的结果。

Method: 该研究提出了一种新的k-集协议同步消息传递系统的下界，该系统连接在任意有向通信网络上，并且最多有t个进程可能崩溃。该结果推广了Chaudhuri等人（2000）提出的关于完整网络的t/k+1下界，以及Castaneda等人（2021）和Fraigniaud等人（2024）提出的关于无向网络的下界。拓扑证明方法基于一系列可分壳映射，这些映射通过每轮崩溃k个进程的载体映射来演化协议复形，并使用Sperner引理风格的论证来证明k-集协议的不可能性。该研究还引入了一种新的载体映射来维持高连通性，并提出了一个基于通信图半径的简单下界。

Result: 该研究成功地为同步消息传递系统中具有任意有向通信网络和最多t个进程崩溃的k-集协议问题提供了一个新的下界。该结果推广了先前在完整网络和无向网络上的相关下界。证明方法基于拓扑学，特别是使用可分壳映射来分析协议的演化。

Conclusion: 所提出的拓扑证明非平凡地推广和扩展了在Herlihy、Kozlov和Rajsbaum（2013）的书中所提出的关于完整网络的连通性方法。该证明基于一系列可分壳映射，从一个可分壳输入复形开始，确定协议复形的演化：在每轮t/k轮中，使用恰好每轮崩溃k个进程的载体映射，确保其像的高连通性。一个类似于Sperner引理的论证被用来证明该轮仍然不可能实现k-集协议。从第t/k+1轮到我们的下界，我们采用了维护高连通性的新型载体映射。该证明还为具有初始崩溃的任意通信网络的同步系统中k-集协议提供了一个惊人简单的下界。我们通过适当定义的通信图的半径来表达由此产生的附加协议开销。最后，我们证明了k-集协议的通常输入伪球面复形可以被一个基于Kuhn三角化的指数级更小的输入复形取代，该复形也被证明是可分壳的。

Abstract: We develop a new lower bound for k-set agreement in synchronous
message-passing systems connected by an arbitrary directed communication
network, where up to t processes may crash. Our result thus generalizes the
t/k+1 lower bound for complete networks in the t-resilient model by Chaudhuri,
Herlihy, Lynch, and Tuttle [JACM'00]. Moreover, it generalizes two lower bounds
for oblivious algorithms in synchronous systems connected by an arbitrary
undirected communication network known to the processes, namely, the domination
number-based lower bound by Castaneda, Fraigniaud, Paz, Rajsbaum, Roy, and
Travers [TCS'21] for failure-free processes, and the radius-based lower bound
in the t-resilient model by Fraigniaud, Nguyen, and Paz [STACS'24].
  Our topological proof non-trivially generalizes and extends the
connectivity-based approach for the complete network, as presented in the book
by Herlihy, Kozlov, and Rajsbaum (2013). It is based on a sequence of shellable
carrier maps that, starting from a shellable input complex, determine the
evolution of the protocol complex: During the first t/k rounds, carrier maps
that crash exactly k processes per round are used, ensuring high connectivity
of their images. A Sperner's lemma style argument is used to prove that k-set
agreement is still impossible by that round. From round t/k+1 up to our lower
bound, we employ a novel carrier map that maintains high connectivity. Our
proof also provides a strikingly simple lower bound for k-set agreement in
synchronous systems with an arbitrary communication network with initial
crashes. We express the resulting additional agreement overhead via an
appropriately defined radius of the communication graphs. Finally, we prove
that the usual input pseudosphere complex for k-set agreement can be replaced
by an exponentially smaller input complex based on Kuhn triangulations, which
we prove to be also shellable.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种创新的LLM混合精度推理技术，通过优化的GEMM和Attention流水线，显著降低了延迟并提高了吞吐量。

Motivation: 为了降低大型语言模型（LLMs）的内存和计算需求，本研究致力于开发先进的混合精度推理技术。

Abstract: Mixed-precision inference techniques reduce the memory and computational
demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) by applying hybrid precision formats to
model weights, activations, and KV caches. This work introduces mixed-precision
LLM inference techniques that encompass (i) systematic memory and compute
optimization across hierarchical storage and tensor core architectures, and
(ii) comprehensive end-to-end mixed-precision optimization across diverse
precision formats and hardware configurations. Our approach features two novel
mixed-precision pipelines designed for optimal hardware utilization: a General
Matrix Multiply (GEMM) pipeline that optimizes matrix operations through
offline weight packing and online acceleration, and an attention pipeline that
enables efficient attention computation with arbitrary Query, Key, and Value
precision combinations. The key implementation of the pipelines includes (i)
hardware-aware weight packing for automatic format optimization, (ii) adaptive
head alignment for efficient attention computation, (iii) instruction-level
parallelism for memory hierarchy exploitation, and (iv) KV memory loading
pipeline for enhanced inference efficiency. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations across 16 popular LLMs and 4 representative GPU architectures.
Results demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 61% lower serving latency
(30% on average) and up to 156% higher throughput (58% on average) in
mixed-precision workloads compared to existing mixed-precision frameworks,
establishing consistent performance improvements across all tested
configurations and hardware types. This work is integrated into TurboMind, a
high-performance inference engine of the LMDeploy project, which is
open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/InternLM/lmdeploy.

*Haoran Zhang,Zihao Zhang,Shuai Mu,Sebastian Angel,Vincent Liu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: CausalMesh is a new causally consistent caching system for serverless environments that prevents anomalies caused by migrating functions and differing caches. It offers improved performance and formally verified correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Serverless workflows with a cache layer can suffer from non-intuitive anomalies due to functions being scheduled to different nodes with different caches, leading to issues with state access and potential inconsistencies.

Method: CausalMesh uses a novel approach to causally consistent caching in environments where a computation may migrate from one machine to another. It supports coordination-free and abort-free read/write operations and read transactions when clients roam among multiple servers. It also supports read-write transactional causal consistency at the cost of abort-freedom.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows CausalMesh has lower latency and higher throughput compared to existing solutions.

Conclusion: CausalMesh has lower latency and higher throughput than existing proposals, and its protocol has been formally verified in Dafny.

Abstract: Stateful serverless workflows consist of multiple serverless functions that
access state on a remote database. Developers sometimes add a cache layer
between the serverless runtime and the database to improve I/O latency.
However, in a serverless environment, functions in the same workflow may be
scheduled to different nodes with different caches, which can cause
non-intuitive anomalies. This paper presents CausalMesh, a novel approach to
causally consistent caching in environments where a computation may migrate
from one machine to another, such as in serverless computing. CausalMesh is the
first cache system that supports coordination-free and abort-free read/write
operations and read transactions when clients roam among multiple servers.
CausalMesh also supports read-write transactional causal consistency in the
presence of client roaming, but at the cost of abort-freedom.
  We have formally verified CausalMesh's protocol in Dafny, and our
experimental evaluation shows that CausalMesh has lower latency and higher
throughput than existing proposals

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的定向q分析算法，该算法通过优化计算过程，实现了与输出大小的线性时间复杂度，解决了现有方法的效率瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了克服现有定向q分析算法效率低下的问题，这些算法的计算复杂度与输入大小的平方成正比。

Method: 通过逆转计算顺序，并利用目标预计算和缓存策略，开发了一种新的定向q分析算法，其时间复杂度与输出大小成线性关系。

Result: 提出的算法在实际应用中比现有方法更有效，并且在温和假设下具有时间最优性。

Conclusion: 定向q分析的算法是时间最优的。

Abstract: Directed q-analysis is a recent extension of q-analysis, an established
method for extracting structure from networks, to directed graphs. Until
recently, a lack of efficient algorithms heavily restricted the application of
this technique: Previous approaches scale with the square of the input size,
which is also the maximal size of the output, rendering such approaches
worst-case optimal. In practice, output sizes of relevant networks are usually
far from the worst case, a fact that could be exploited by an (efficient)
output-sensitive algorithm. We develop such an algorithm and formally describe
it in detail. The key insight, obtained by carefully studying various
approaches to directed q-analysis and how they relate to each other, is that
inverting the order of computation leads to significant complexity gains.
Targeted precomputation and caching tactics further reduce the introduced
overhead, enough to achieve (under mild assumptions) a time complexity that is
linear in output size. The resulting algorithm for performing directed
q-analysis is shown to be time-optimal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a neuro-symbolic reasoning architecture that integrates symbolic logic and neural inference using Graph Signal Processing (GSP) as the primary computational backbone, moving beyond conventional models where spectral graph methods are peripheral.

Method: The proposed architecture is a fully spectral, neuro-symbolic reasoning architecture that leverages Graph Signal Processing (GSP) as the primary computational backbone. Logical entities and relationships are encoded as graph signals, processed via learnable spectral filters, and mapped into symbolic predicates for rule-based inference. The approach includes a complete mathematical framework for spectral reasoning, incorporating graph Fourier transforms, band-selective attention, and spectral rule grounding.

Conclusion: The results suggest that Graph Signal Processing (GSP) provides a mathematically grounded and computationally efficient substrate for robust and interpretable reasoning systems.

Abstract: We propose a fully spectral, neuro\-symbolic reasoning architecture that

Conclusion: 该计算框架为目标导向的学习提供了统一的账户，该账户涵盖了行为、现象和神经维度，具有跨不同基质的潜力。

Abstract: Purposeful behavior is a hallmark of natural and artificial intelligence. Its
acquisition is often believed to rely on world models, comprising both
descriptive (what is) and prescriptive (what is desirable) aspects that
identify and evaluate state of affairs in the world, respectively. Canonical
computational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning,
posit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation
(descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an
alternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is
that these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal.
Here, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state
representation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive
aspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction
sequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a
construct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of
goal-equivalent experience distributions. Telic states provide a parsimonious
account of goal-directed learning in terms of the statistical divergence
between behavioral policies and desirable experience features. We review
empirical and theoretical literature supporting this novel perspective and
discuss its potential to provide a unified account of behavioral,
phenomenological and neural dimensions of purposeful behaviors across diverse
substrates.

Motivation: 当前大多数群体动画和模拟工作主要依赖于转向和固定的高级别目标外推，未能充分考虑由语言和对话驱动的复杂社会和环境交互对人类导航和群体移动的影响。

Method: 通过利用大型语言模型（LLMs）来控制自主导航。该方法包含两个主要组件：一个对话系统和一种由语言驱动的导航。具体而言，我们会定期查询以代理为中心的LLMs，并结合角色的个性、角色、欲望和关系等信息，来控制代理间的对话生成（当空间和社会关系需要时）。然后，我们利用对话内容以及每个代理的个性、情绪状态、视野和身体状态来控制其导航和转向。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能够自动产生代理的分组和解散行为，并可作为群体内的信息传递机制，最终实现更真实的群体模拟，并自然涌现出群体行为。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现更真实的群体模拟，并能从任何环境设置中自然涌现出群体行为。

Abstract: Animating and simulating crowds using an agent-based approach is a
well-established area where every agent in the crowd is individually controlled
such that global human-like behaviour emerges. We observe that human navigation
and movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental
interactions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing
work does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where
agent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering
and fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.
  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to
control agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system
and language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs
conditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to
control the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial
and social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation
and each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to
control the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables
agents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the
ongoing dialogue.
  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay
between social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we
observe that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.
Additionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an
information-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework
produces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours
arising naturally from any environmental setting.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决旅游推荐系统中存在的流行度偏差问题，并提升推荐结果的多样性。

Method: 提出了一种名为Collab-REC的多智能体框架，其中包含三个基于LLM的智能体（个性化、流行度和可持续性）和一个非LLM的调节智能体。这三个智能体分别从不同的角度生成城市建议，随后由调节智能体通过多轮协商进行合并和优化，以纳入每个智能体的观点并惩罚重复或无效的建议。

Result: 在欧洲城市查询的实验中，Collab-REC相比单一智能体基线，能够提高推荐结果的多样性和整体相关性，推荐一些访问量较少但通常被忽视的地点。

Conclusion: Collab-REC通过多方协作和多轮协商，能够有效提升旅游推荐的多样性和整体相关性，并能顾及到用户提出的限制条件，从而有效缓解旅游业过度饱和的问题。

Abstract: We propose Collab-REC, a multi-agent framework designed to counteract
popularity bias and enhance diversity in tourism recommendations. In our
setting, three LLM-based agents -- Personalization, Popularity, and
Sustainability generate city suggestions from complementary perspectives. A
non-LLM moderator then merges and refines these proposals via multi-round
negotiation, ensuring each agent's viewpoint is incorporated while penalizing
spurious or repeated responses. Experiments on European city queries show that
Collab-REC improves diversity and overall relevance compared to a single-agent
baseline, surfacing lesser-visited locales that often remain overlooked. This
balanced, context-aware approach addresses over-tourism and better aligns with
constraints provided by the user, highlighting the promise of multi-stakeholder
collaboration in LLM-driven recommender systems.

Method: 引入了一个名为 See it. Say it. Sorted. 的无训练的 agentic 系统，该系统将视觉-语言模型 (VLM) 与大型语言模型 (LLM) 相结合，以生成可编辑的可缩放矢量图形 (SVG) 程序。该系统运行一个迭代循环：Critic VLM 提出一组定性的、关系性的编辑；多个候选 LLM 使用多种策略（保守 -> 激进、替代、专注）合成 SVG 更新；Judge VLM 选择最佳候选者，确保稳定改进。该设计优先考虑定性推理而非脆弱的数值估计，保留全局约束（例如，对齐、连通性），并自然支持人机循环校正。

Result: 在从已发表论文中提取的 10 个流程图草图上，与 GPT-5 和 Gemini-2.5-Pro 相比，该方法更忠实地重建了布局和结构，准确地合成了图元（例如，多头箭头），并且没有插入不必要的文本。

Conclusion: 该方法在重构布局和结构方面优于两种前沿闭源图像生成语言模型（GPT-5 和 Gemini-2.5-Pro），能够准确地组合图元（例如，多头箭头）而不插入不必要的文本。由于输出是程序化的 SVG，因此可以通过 API 轻松地将其扩展到演示工具（例如 PowerPoint），并且可以通过改进的提示和特定任务的工具进行专门化。

Abstract: We study sketch-to-diagram generation: converting rough hand sketches into
precise, compositional diagrams. Diffusion models excel at photorealism but
struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required
for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic
system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system
runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of
qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates
with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a
Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design
prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves
global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports
human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in
published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure
than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and
Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows)
without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the
approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via
APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools. The

*Gaoke Zhang,Bo Wang,Yunlong Ma,Dongming Zhao,Zifei Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MMS通过认知心理学启发的多记忆系统，解决了LLM代理的历史数据处理和响应质量问题，实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM代理记忆模块（如MemoryBank和A-MEM）在存储记忆内容的质量方面存在不足，影响了检索性能和响应质量。需要一种更有效的方法来构建高质量的长期记忆内容。

Method: 提出了一种受认知心理学启发的MMS（multiple memory system），将短期记忆处理为多个长期记忆片段，并构建了检索记忆单元和上下文记忆单元，实现了记忆内容的高质量构建和检索。

Result: 在LoCoMo数据集上的实验表明，MMS优于其他三种方法。验证性实验证实了其记忆单元设计的合理性，鲁棒性分析也证明了其实用价值。

Conclusion: MMS通过将短期记忆转化为多个长期记忆片段，并构建检索记忆单元和上下文记忆单元，有效解决了LLM代理处理历史数据和提高响应质量的挑战。实验证明了其有效性、合理性和实用价值。

Abstract: An agent powered by large language models have achieved impressive results,
but effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during
interactions remains a challenge. The current approach is to design a memory
module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as
MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects
recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct
high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory
system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes
short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs
retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments,
with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase,
MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's
query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the
context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively
utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method
with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the
rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the
number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its
practical value.

*Romain Lacombe,Kerrie Wu,Eddie Dilworth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究发现，增加大型语言模型的推理预算会损害其置信度校准能力，而搜索增强生成方法通过信息检索能显著提高校准准确性，表明信息获取比推理深度对知识密集型任务的置信度校准更为重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高大型语言模型作为问答工具时的可靠性，需要解决其过度自信的问题。

Method: 本研究使用ClimateX数据集（Lacombe等人，2023），并将其扩展到人类和行星健康领域，系统地评估了推理能力和计算预算对置信度评估准确性的影响。

Result: 研究发现，尽管最近的推理大型语言模型在评估专家置信度方面达到了48.7%的准确率，但增加推理预算会损害而非改善校准。扩展推理会导致系统性过度自信，随着思考预算的增加而恶化。相比之下，搜索增强生成通过检索相关证据，准确率高达89.3%，表现远优于纯粹推理。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在作为问答工具部署时，需要进行有效的校准以避免过度自信。本研究系统地评估了推理能力和计算预算对置信度评估准确性的影响。研究结果表明，测试时缩放范式存在挑战，扩展推理会系统性地导致过度自信，而搜索增强生成在信息检索方面表现优于纯粹推理，表明信息获取可能是提高知识密集型任务的置信度校准的关键瓶颈。

Abstract: Large Language Models deployed as question answering tools require robust
calibration to avoid overconfidence. We systematically evaluate how reasoning
capabilities and budget affect confidence assessment accuracy, using the
ClimateX dataset (Lacombe et al., 2023) and expanding it to human and planetary
health. Our key finding challenges the "test-time scaling" paradigm: while
recent reasoning LLMs achieve 48.7% accuracy in assessing expert confidence,
increasing reasoning budgets consistently impairs rather than improves
calibration. Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens
with longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond
modest computational investments. Conversely, search-augmented generation
dramatically outperforms pure reasoning, achieving 89.3% accuracy by retrieving
relevant evidence. Our results suggest that information access, rather than
reasoning depth or inference budget, may be the critical bottleneck for
improved confidence calibration of knowledge-intensive tasks.

### [151] [Understanding Action Effects through Instrumental Empowerment in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15652)
*Ardian Selmonaj,Miroslav Strupl,Oleg Szehr,Alessandro Antonucci*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 在没有价值反馈的情况下，通过分析策略分布来推断MARL中代理行为的一种新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了可靠地部署多主体强化学习（MARL）系统，了解团队内个体代理的行为至关重要。虽然以往的工作通常根据明确的奖励信号或学习到的价值函数来评估团队的整体表现，但尚不清楚在没有任何价值反馈的情况下如何推断代理的贡献。

Method: 该方法提出了一种名为预期合作价值（ICV）的新方法，该方法基于信息论Shapley值，用于量化每个代理对其联合参与者工具能力的有因影响。具体来说，ICV通过评估其决策不确定性和偏好一致性来衡量代理对其队友策略的行动效应。

Result: 该分析揭示了代理采用相似或不同策略的程度，并确定了哪些代理行为有利于团队成功，方法是促进确定性决策或为未来的行动选择保留灵活性。

Conclusion: 该方法为MARL系统提供了新的见解，并增强了其可解释性。

Abstract: To reliably deploy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, it is
crucial to understand individual agent behaviors within a team. While prior
work typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward
signals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent
contributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we
investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted
that are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing
the policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents
tend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the
likelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a
method based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each
agent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment.
Specifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies
by assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis
across cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to
which agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects
between policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent
behaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic
decisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices. Our proposed
method offers novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances
explainability in MARL systems.

TL;DR: LGT框架使用多智能体大语言模型和自然语言推理来优化机器学习配置，通过文本梯度提供语义反馈，并由顾问、评估者和优化器三个智能体协同工作，实现了比传统方法更好的性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的配置优化方法在处理模型架构、训练策略、特征工程和超参数等多个维度时，存在独立处理、缺乏可解释性以及动态适应性和语义推理能力不足的问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为语言引导调优（LGT）的新框架，该框架利用多智能体大语言模型通过自然语言推理来智能地优化配置。LGT引入了文本梯度，这是一种定性反馈信号，通过提供对训练动态和配置相互依赖性的语义理解来补充数值优化。LGT协调三个专业智能体：提供配置更改建议的顾问、评估进展的评估者以及优化决策过程的优化器，形成了一个自我改进的反馈循环。

Result: 在六个多样化的数据集上进行了全面评估，LGT框架在性能上相比传统优化方法实现了显著的提升，并且保持了高可解释性。

Conclusion: LGT框架通过多智能体大语言模型和文本梯度，实现了配置优化的协同调优、可解释性和动态适应性，并在六个多样化数据集上取得了显著优于传统方法的性能提升。

Abstract: Configuration optimization remains a critical bottleneck in machine learning,
requiring coordinated tuning across model architecture, training strategy,
feature engineering, and hyperparameters. Traditional approaches treat these
dimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated
methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about
optimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel
framework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently
optimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual
gradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization
by providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration
interdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that
proposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an
Optimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving
feedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT
demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,
achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.

*Shuang Ao,Gopal Rumchurn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: S3LoRA improves safety in LoRA-adapted LLMs without needing original models, by pruning unsafe weight updates identified through MAS-SVD and SSI, maintaining performance and reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PEFT techniques like LoRA, while enabling powerful LLM capabilities, can compromise safety alignment, especially in agent planning. Existing safety methods require unavailable model checkpoints.

Method: S3LoRA, a framework that inspects only the fine-tuned weight updates, uses MAS-SVD to analyze LoRA updates and SSI to detect unsafe layers, which are then pruned.

Result: Experiments show S3LoRA improves safety metrics, maintains or improves utility metrics, and reduces inference cost across agent planning and language generation tasks.

Conclusion: S3LoRA is a practical and scalable solution for safely deploying LLM-based agents in real-world, resource-constrained, and safety-critical environments, improving safety metrics while maintaining or improving utility metrics and reducing inference cost.

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) using parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques such as LoRA has enabled powerful capabilities in LLM-based
agents. However, these adaptations can unintentionally compromise safety
alignment, leading to unsafe or unstable behaviors, particularly in agent
planning tasks. Existing safety-aware adaptation methods often require access
to both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints, which are frequently
unavailable in practice, limiting their applicability. We propose S3LoRA (Safe
Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning LoRA), a lightweight, data-free, and
model-independent framework that mitigates safety risks in LoRA-adapted models
by inspecting only the fine-tuned weight updates. We first introduce
Magnitude-Aware Spherically Normalized SVD (MAS-SVD), which robustly analyzes
the structural properties of LoRA updates while preserving global magnitude
information. We then design the Spectral Sharpness Index (SSI), a
sharpness-aware metric to detect layers with highly concentrated and
potentially unsafe updates. These layers are pruned post-hoc to reduce risk
without sacrificing task performance. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies across agent planning and language generation tasks show that S3LoRA
consistently improves safety metrics while maintaining or improving utility
metrics and significantly reducing inference cost. These results establish
S3LoRA as a practical and scalable solution for safely deploying LLM-based
agents in real-world, resource-constrained, and safety-critical environments.

Motivation: Embodied AI agents need to infer and act on diverse, undefined human goals and preferences in an interpretable way. The paper introduces Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs) to formalize this setting, where agents reason over unbounded and evolving goal spaces.

Method: GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue): a data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in natural language during human interaction and infers a distribution over natural language goals. It prompts an LLM to simulate users with different complex intents and uses its responses for probabilistic inference over candidate goals.

Result: GOOD enables rich goal representations and uncertainty estimation without large offline datasets. It was evaluated in text-based grocery shopping and AI2Thor household robotics environments using synthetic user profiles.

Conclusion: GOOD method outperforms baseline without explicit goal tracking, confirmed by LLM-based and human evaluations.

Abstract: Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI agents to
autonomously generate scientific proposals, conduct experiments, author papers,
and perform peer reviews. Yet this flood of AI-generated research content
collides with a fragmented and largely closed publication ecosystem.
Traditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them
difficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content;
existing preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control
mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated
research lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to
advance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a
next-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists. Its
multi-agent architecture allows research proposals and papers to be submitted,
reviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. It also
provides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of
heterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible
ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments,
we demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly
enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after
iterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv. Our work lays the groundwork for a
next-generation open-access ecosystem for AI scientists, accelerating the
publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research content.

Abstract: High-quality mathematical and logical datasets with verifiable answers are
essential for strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). While recent data augmentation techniques have facilitated the creation
of large-scale benchmarks, existing LLM-generated datasets often suffer from
limited reliability, diversity, and scalability. To address these challenges,
we introduce PuzzleClone, a formal framework for synthesizing verifiable data
at scale using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). Our approach features
three key innovations: (1) encoding seed puzzles into structured logical
specifications, (2) generating scalable variants through systematic variable
and constraint randomization, and (3) ensuring validity via a reproduction
mechanism. Applying PuzzleClone, we construct a curated benchmark comprising
over 83K diverse and programmatically validated puzzles. The generated puzzles
span a wide spectrum of difficulty and formats, posing significant challenges
to current state-of-the-art models. We conduct post training (SFT and RL) on
PuzzleClone datasets. Experimental results show that training on PuzzleClone
yields substantial improvements not only on PuzzleClone testset but also on
logic and mathematical benchmarks. Post training raises PuzzleClone average
from 14.4 to 56.2 and delivers consistent improvements across 7 logic and
mathematical benchmarks up to 12.5 absolute percentage points (AMC2023 from
52.5 to 65.0). Our code and data are available at

TL;DR: LLM4Sweat是一个开源的LLM框架，用于支持多汗症患者，通过数据增强、模型微调和专家评估来提供诊断、治疗和心理支持，并证明了其在处理罕见病方面的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于用于微调的数据集稀疏且不可靠，因此在医疗保健领域应用大型语言模型（LLM）仍然存在挑战，特别是在罕见病领域。为了解决这一差距，作者提出了LLM4Sweat，这是一个专门针对原发性局灶性多汗症（一种影响2-3%人口的罕见病）的LLM框架。

Conclusion: LLM4Sweat是首个用于处理原发性局灶性多汗症的开源LLM框架，为数据稀疏和可信度具有挑战性的罕见病提供了一种可推广的方法。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in healthcare, their
application for rare medical conditions is still hindered by scarce and
unreliable datasets for fine-tuning. Hyperhidrosis, a disorder causing
excessive sweating beyond physiological needs, is one such rare disorder,
affecting 2-3% of the population and significantly impacting both physical
comfort and psychosocial well-being. To date, no work has tailored LLMs to
advance the diagnosis or care of hyperhidrosis. To address this gap, we present
LLM4Sweat, an open-source and domain-specific LLM framework for trustworthy and
empathetic hyperhidrosis support. The system follows a three-stage pipeline. In
the data augmentation stage, a frontier LLM generates medically plausible
synthetic vignettes from curated open-source data to create a diverse and
balanced question-answer dataset. In the fine-tuning stage, an open-source
foundation model is fine-tuned on the dataset to provide diagnosis,
personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.
In the inference and expert evaluation stage, clinical and psychological
specialists assess accuracy, appropriateness, and empathy, with validated
responses iteratively enriching the dataset. Experiments show that LLM4Sweat
outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for
hyperhidrosis, offering a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with

### [161] [R-ConstraintBench: Evaluating LLMs on NP-Complete Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15204)
*Raj Jain,Marc Wetter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs在处理高约束调度问题（如RCPSP）时，性能会因约束的复杂性（尤其是交互作用）而显著下降，并且在现实场景中的泛化能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对LLMs在高约束条件下的推理能力表征不足，而有效调度在许多领域（如项目管理、制造、物流和IT）至关重要。

Method: 提出了一个名为R-ConstraintBench的可扩展框架，用于评估LLMs在资源受限项目调度问题（RCPSP）上的性能。该框架通过线性增加约束（包括优先约束、停机时间、时间窗口和析取约束）来逐步提高问题的难度，并进行可行性和错误分析。

Result: 在仅包含优先约束的DAGs上，强大的LLMs表现接近完美；但当引入停机时间、时间窗口和析取约束时，LLMs的可行性性能急剧下降。性能下降与约束的交互作用有关，而非图的深度。此外，LLMs在合成数据上的表现并不能很好地迁移到特定领域的数据上。

Conclusion: LLMs在处理包含停机时间、时间窗口和析取约束的RCPSP问题时，性能会急剧下降，这表明约束之间的相互作用是主要瓶颈，而不是图的深度。LLMs在干净的合成数据上的表现并不能保证在实际应用场景中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Effective scheduling under tight resource, timing, and operational
constraints underpins large-scale planning across sectors such as capital
projects, manufacturing, logistics, and IT fleet transitions. However, the
reliability of large language models (LLMs) when reasoning under
high-constraint regimes is insufficiently characterized. To address this gap,
we present R-ConstraintBench, a scalable framework that evaluates models on
Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSP), an NP-Complete
feasibility class, while difficulty increases via linear growth in constraints.
R-ConstraintBench incrementally increases non-redundant precedence constraints
in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and then introduces downtime, temporal
windows, and disjunctive constraints. As an illustrative example, we
instantiate the benchmark in a data center migration setting and evaluate
multiple LLMs using feasibility and error analysis, identifying degradation
thresholds and constraint types most associated with failure. Empirically,
strong models are near-ceiling on precedence-only DAGs, but feasibility
performance collapses when downtime, temporal windows, and disjunctive
constraints interact, implicating constraint interaction, not graph depth, as
the principal bottleneck. Performance on clean synthetic ramps also does not
guarantee transfer to domain-grounded scenarios, underscoring limited
generalization.

Conclusion: 本研究提出的算法（特别是CR+DES）在土地利用兼容性方面比现有方法提高了3.16%，而MSBX+MO在价格优化方面提高了3.3%。统计分析证实，集成差分向量的算法在多个指标上显著优于传统方法，并且约束放宽技术在保持实际约束的同时，能够更广泛地探索解空间。这些发现为城市规划者和决策者提供了基于证据的计算工具，用于平衡土地利用分配中的竞争性目标，从而支持快速城市化地区更有效的城市发展政策。

Abstract: Urban land-use allocation represents a complex multi-objective optimization
problem critical for sustainable urban development policy. This paper presents
novel computational intelligence approaches for optimizing land-use allocation
in mixed-use areas, addressing inherent trade-offs between land-use
compatibility and economic objectives. We develop multiple optimization
algorithms, including custom variants integrating differential evolution with
multi-objective genetic algorithms. Key contributions include: (1) CR+DES
algorithm leveraging scaled difference vectors for enhanced exploration, (2)
systematic constraint relaxation strategy improving solution quality while
maintaining feasibility, and (3) statistical validation using Kruskal-Wallis
tests with compact letter displays. Applied to a real-world case study with
1,290 plots, CR+DES achieves 3.16\% improvement in land-use compatibility
compared to state-of-the-art methods, while MSBX+MO excels in price
optimization with 3.3\% improvement. Statistical analysis confirms algorithms
incorporating difference vectors significantly outperform traditional
approaches across multiple metrics. The constraint relaxation technique enables
broader solution space exploration while maintaining practical constraints.
These findings provide urban planners and policymakers with evidence-based
computational tools for balancing competing objectives in land-use allocation,
supporting more effective urban development policies in rapidly urbanizing
regions.

### [163] [Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory for LLM Agent Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15305)
*Wei Yang,Jinwei Xiao,Hongming Zhang,Qingyang Zhang,Yanna Wang,Bo Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 为了提高LLM在复杂规划任务中的表现，我们提出了Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory框架。该框架通过结合粗粒度和细粒度记忆，并将其与LLM进行 grounding，可以灵活适应各种场景，并能有效处理环境异常，实现自我反思和计划修正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的智能体在复杂规划任务中虽然表现出潜力，但为了避免高昂的训练成本，通常依赖内存机制来增强LLM的离线经验或在线轨迹分析能力。然而，这些方法局限于单一粒度的记忆，这些记忆源于动态环境交互，其质量受到收集经验的限制，这反过来又限制了知识的多样性和规划的灵活性。

Method: 提出了一种名为Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory（Ours{}）的新框架，该框架将粗粒度和细粒度的记忆与LLM相结合，以实现灵活适应各种场景。具体来说，Ours{}在训练任务中将环境信息 grounding 到粗粒度的焦点上，以指导经验收集，然后将可操作的混合粒度提示 grounding 到每个经验中。在推理时，Ours{}检索与任务相关的经验和提示来支持规划。当面对环境异常时，LLM将当前情况 grounding 到细粒度的关键信息中，从而实现灵活的自我问答反思和计划修正。

Result: 所提出的Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory框架通过将粗粒度焦点和细粒度提示与LLM相结合，能够有效提升LLM在复杂规划任务中的表现，特别是在处理环境异常和需要灵活适应不同场景时。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory框架能够弥补现有方法的不足，通过细粒度的记忆 grounding 来提高LLM在复杂规划任务中的灵活性和适应性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven growing
interest in LLM-based agents for complex planning tasks. To avoid costly agent
training, many studies adopted memory mechanism that enhances LLM with offline
experiences or online trajectory analysis. However, existing works focus on
single-granularity memory derived from dynamic environmental interactions,
which are inherently constrained by the quality of the collected experiences.
This limitation, in turn, constrain the diversity of knowledge and the
flexibility of planning. We propose Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory (\Ours{}), a
novel framework that grounds coarse-to-fine memories with LLM, thereby fully
leverage them for flexible adaptation to diverse scenarios. \Ours{} grounds
environmental information into coarse-grained focus points to guide experience
collection in training tasks, followed by grounding of actionable
hybrid-grained tips from each experience. At inference, \Ours{} retrieves
task-relevant experiences and tips to support planning. When facing
environmental anomalies, the LLM grounds the current situation into
fine-grained key information, enabling flexible self-QA reflection and plan
correction.

### [164] [Search-Based Credit Assignment for Offline Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15327)
*Xiancheng Gao,Yufeng Shi,Wengang Zhou,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPW 是一种搜索偏好加权方案，它结合了专家演示和偏好数据，通过将偏好数据与演示数据中的相似状态-动作对进行匹配来学习策略，从而在机器人操作任务中实现了更精确的信用分配和优于先前方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习通常依赖于精心设计的奖励函数，而人类反馈（专家演示和偏好）是具有成本效益的替代方案，但两者都有局限性。演示成本高且行为模式有限，而偏好则难以解决信用分配问题。

Method: SPW 搜索偏好标签轨迹中的每个转换，以找到与专家演示中最相似的状态-动作对，并基于它们的相似度得分直接推导出步骤重要性权重，然后使用这些权重来指导标准的偏好学习。

Result: SPW 实现了比传统方法更精确的信用分配，并且在机器人操作任务上表现优于其他方法。

Conclusion: SPW 能够有效地从偏好和演示中进行联合学习，在具有挑战性的机器人操作任务上优于利用这两种反馈类型的先前方法。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning refers to the process of learning policies
from fixed datasets, without requiring additional environment interaction.
However, it often relies on well-defined reward functions, which are difficult
and expensive to design. Human feedback is an appealing alternative, but its
two common forms, expert demonstrations and preferences, have complementary
limitations. Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly
to collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast,
preferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior
contribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved.
In this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to
unify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled
trajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert
demonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their
similarity scores. These weights are then used to guide standard preference
learning, enabling more accurate credit assignment that traditional approaches
struggle to achieve. We demonstrate that SPW enables effective joint learning
from preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that leverage
both feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks.

*Bin Deng,Yizhe Feng,Zeming Liu,Qing Wei,Xiangrong Zhu,Shuai Chen,Yuanfang Guo,Yunhong Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新的旅行规划方法TGMA和RETAIL数据集，以解决现有系统无法处理隐式需求、环境因素和缺乏详细信息的问题。实验证明TGMA比现有方法效果更好，但真实世界旅行规划仍具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化旅行规划系统未能很好地适应真实世界场景，主要体现在：1. 假设用户查询是明确的，而现实中需求往往是隐含的；2. 忽略了环境因素和用户偏好，导致计划不可行；3. 仅能生成基础的POI安排，无法提供包含丰富细节的一站式计划。

Method: 提出了一种名为TGMA（topic-guided multi-agent）的框架，并构建了一个名为RETAIL的新数据集，以支持隐式查询的决策，同时涵盖显式查询（包括是否需要修改），并考虑环境因素和详细的POI信息。

Result: 通过实验发现，现有最强的模型在真实世界旅行规划任务上的通过率仅为1.0%，而TGMA框架的通过率显著提高到2.72%。

Conclusion: TGMA框架在真实世界旅行规划方面表现出比现有模型高得多的成功率（2.72% vs 1.0%），表明其在解决现有系统与真实场景不匹配方面的潜力。

Abstract: Although large language models have enhanced automated travel planning
abilities, current systems remain misaligned with real-world scenarios. First,
they assume users provide explicit queries, while in reality requirements are
often implicit. Second, existing solutions ignore diverse environmental factors
and user preferences, limiting the feasibility of plans. Third, systems can
only generate plans with basic POI arrangements, failing to provide all-in-one
plans with rich details. To mitigate these challenges, we construct a novel
dataset \textbf{RETAIL}, which supports decision-making for implicit queries
while covering explicit queries, both with and without revision needs. It also
enables environmental awareness to ensure plan feasibility under real-world
scenarios, while incorporating detailed POI information for all-in-one travel
plans. Furthermore, we propose a topic-guided multi-agent framework, termed
TGMA. Our experiments reveal that even the strongest existing model achieves
merely a 1.0% pass rate, indicating real-world travel planning remains
extremely challenging. In contrast, TGMA demonstrates substantially improved
performance 2.72%, offering promising directions for real-world travel
planning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DiagECG 是一个新框架，通过符号化 ECG 信号和整合语言模型，改进了 ECG 分析的自动化和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动化方法在临床任务的泛化能力以及开放式推理支持方面存在不足，因此需要一种新的方法来改进 ECG 分析。

Method: DiagECG 框架整合了时间序列和语言建模，通过独立于导联的编码器和量化模块将连续 ECG 嵌入离散化为符号标记，LLM 可以在统一的方式中处理 ECG 和自然语言输入。通过在自回归 ECG 预测任务上进行预训练，使 LLM 能够利用其语言建模能力来模拟时间动态。最后，在 ECG 问答和诊断报告生成任务上进行了指令微调。

Result: DiagECG 在 ECG 问答和诊断报告生成任务上取得了强大的性能，并能泛化到分布外设置，验证了每个组件的有效性。

Conclusion: DiagECG 通过将符号化 ECG 表征整合到 LLM 中，在医学推理方面展现了巨大潜力，并在跨任务和跨分布设置中实现了强大的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet
existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical
tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a
novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling
large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text
generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into
symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These
tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to
handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the
modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task,
enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling
capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question
answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model,
DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining
generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of
integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.

Abstract: In many planning applications, we might be interested in finding plans that
minimally modify the initial state to achieve the goals. We refer to this
concept as plan disruption. In this paper, we formally introduce it, and define
various planning-based compilations that aim to jointly optimize both the sum
of action costs and plan disruption. Experimental results in different
benchmarks show that the reformulated task can be effectively solved in
practice to generate plans that balance both objectives.

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种可扩展、可配置且高保真的合成数据生成解决方案，可满足LLM训练中对高质量SFT和DPO数据的需求，显著降低了数据准备的开销。

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) is critically dependent on
the availability of high-quality datasets for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
alignment tasks like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), etc. In this work,
we present a comprehensive synthetic data generation framework that facilitates
scalable, configurable, and high-fidelity generation of synthetic data tailored
for these training paradigms. Our approach employs a modular and
configuration-based pipeline capable of modeling complex dialogue flows with
minimal manual intervention. This framework uses a dual-stage quality tagging
mechanism, combining heuristic rules and LLM-based evaluations, to
automatically filter and score data extracted from OASST-formatted
conversations, ensuring the curation of high-quality dialogue samples. The
resulting datasets are structured under a flexible schema supporting both SFT
and DPO use cases, enabling seamless integration into diverse training
workflows. Together, these innovations offer a robust solution for generating
and managing synthetic conversational data at scale, significantly reducing the
overhead of data preparation in LLM training pipelines.

generalized entropy measure to optimize collaborative efficiency, and a
multi-level Stackelberg game to handle hierarchical decision processes.
Additionally, contextual Thompson sampling is employed for prompt optimization,

*Yekun Zhu,Guang Chen,Chengjun Mao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR:  LLMs can wastefully overthink complex problems. We propose 'Think in Blocks' to let LLMs adapt their reasoning length (number of blocks) to the problem's difficulty, saving computation and speeding up responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs with chains-of-thought perform well on complex reasoning tasks, but long chains can lead to overthinking, computational waste, and slow responses. This raises the question of whether LLMs can dynamically adjust reasoning length based on task complexity.

Method: The Think in Blocks framework partitions reasoning into a tunable number of blocks, enabling adaptive reasoning. It involves predicting a reasoning budget (number of blocks) and then partitioning reasoning accordingly. The model is trained via a three-stage pipeline: Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning. Reasoning depth can be dynamically controlled at inference time using the explicit block count.

Result: The Think in Blocks framework allows LLMs to adapt their reasoning depth to problem difficulty, offering flexible control over chain-of-thought length during deployment.

Conclusion: LLMs can dynamically adjust reasoning length based on task complexity through the Think in Blocks framework.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with chains-of-thought have demonstrated strong
performance on an increasing range of tasks, particularly those involving
complex logical reasoning. However, excessively long chains can lead to
overthinking, causing computational waste and slower responses. This raises a
question: can LLMs dynamically adjust the length of their reasoning processes
based on task complexity? To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks
framework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by
partitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main
contributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in
which the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of
blocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive
model through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided
Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its
reasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count
to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible
adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment.

Abstract: With the prospect of autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents, studying
their tendency for cooperative behavior becomes an increasingly relevant topic.
This study is inspired by the super-additive cooperation theory, where the
combined effects of repeated interactions and inter-group rivalry have been
argued to be the cause for cooperative tendencies found in humans. We devised a
virtual tournament where language model agents, grouped into teams, face each
other in a Prisoner's Dilemma game. By simulating both internal team dynamics
and external competition, we discovered that this blend substantially boosts
both overall and initial, one-shot cooperation levels (the tendency to
cooperate in one-off interactions). This research provides a novel framework
for large language models to strategize and act in complex social scenarios and
offers evidence for how intergroup competition can, counter-intuitively, result
in more cooperative behavior. These insights are crucial for designing future
multi-agent AI systems that can effectively work together and better align with
human values. Source code is available at

Conclusion: 通过组合和迭代进化方法生成更复杂的问题，并利用直接偏好优化（DPO）微调大型语言模型以优化工具链策略，从而提高其在复杂3D场景中的推理能力。

Abstract: This work enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform
complex reasoning in 3D scenes. Recent work has addressed the 3D situated
reasoning task by invoking tool usage through large language models. Large
language models call tools via APIs and integrate the generated programs
through a chain of thought to solve problems based on the program results.
However, due to the simplicity of the questions in the dataset, the generated
program reasoning chains are relatively short. To solve this main challenge, in
this paper, we introduce DeepThink3D to enhance the tool usage of LLMs in
complex 3D situated reasoning tasks. Our work proposes a combinatorial and
iterative evolutionary approach on the SQA3D benchmark to generate more complex
questions. Building on this foundation, we fine-tune the large language model
to make it more proficient in using 3D tools. By employing Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), we directly optimize the toolchain strategies generated by
models, thereby enhancing their accuracy in complex tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在安全关键系统中的应用受限于对其学习策略的鲁棒性和安全性缺乏形式化验证方法。

Method: 通过将强化学习代理及其环境视为离散时间自主动力学系统，并利用李雅普诺夫指数（FTLE）识别和可视化拉格朗日相干结构（LCS），将动力学系统理论应用于形式化验证。提出了一系列定量指标（MBR、ASAS、TASAS）来衡量策略的安全裕度与鲁棒性，并提供了导出局部稳定性保证的方法，同时考虑模型不确定性。

Result: 实验证明，该框架能够识别出疏散LCS作为安全边界，吸引LCS揭示收敛特性和潜在的故障模式（如“陷阱”状态）。定量指标提供了策略安全裕度和鲁棒性的衡量标准。该框架能够成功识别出那些仅从奖励来看似乎表现良好的策略中的关键缺陷。

Conclusion: 该框架为评估和理解强化学习策略在安全关键系统中的行为提供了一种全面且可解释的方法，能够识别出仅凭奖励可能无法发现的关键缺陷。

Abstract: The application of reinforcement learning to safety-critical systems is
limited by the lack of formal methods for verifying the robustness and safety
of learned policies. This paper introduces a novel framework that addresses
this gap by analyzing the combination of an RL agent and its environment as a
discrete-time autonomous dynamical system. By leveraging tools from dynamical
systems theory, specifically the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE), we
identify and visualize Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) that act as the
hidden "skeleton" governing the system's behavior. We demonstrate that
repelling LCS function as safety barriers around unsafe regions, while
attracting LCS reveal the system's convergence properties and potential failure
modes, such as unintended "trap" states. To move beyond qualitative
visualization, we introduce a suite of quantitative metrics, Mean Boundary
Repulsion (MBR), Aggregated Spurious Attractor Strength (ASAS), and
Temporally-Aware Spurious Attractor Strength (TASAS), to formally measure a
policy's safety margin and robustness. We further provide a method for deriving
local stability guarantees and extend the analysis to handle model uncertainty.
Through experiments in both discrete and continuous control environments, we

Motivation: The framework is designed to enable AI developers to focus on modeling data rather than crafting prompts, offering a novel perspective on working with data and AI workflows.

Method: Agentics abstracts agents from the logical flow, using them internally to the data type to enable logical transduction among data. It features a declarative language where data types are provided by LLMs and composed through logical transduction executed by LLMs.

Result: Empirical evidence demonstrates Agentics' applicability and effectiveness in domain-specific multiple-choice question answering, semantic parsing for text-to-SQL, and automated prompt optimization, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy or improved scalability.

Conclusion: Agentics provides a modular framework for building agent-based systems capable of structured reasoning and compositional generalization over complex data, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy or improved scalability in various tasks.

Abstract: This paper introduces Agentics, a modular framework for building agent-based
systems capable of structured reasoning and compositional generalization over
complex data. Designed with research and practical applications in mind,
Agentics offers a novel perspective on working with data and AI workflows. In
this framework, agents are abstracted from the logical flow and they are used
internally to the data type to enable logical transduction among data. Agentics
encourages AI developers to focus on modeling data rather than crafting
prompts, enabling a declarative language in which data types are provided by
LLMs and composed through logical transduction, which is executed by LLMs when
types are connected. We provide empirical evidence demonstrating the
applicability of this framework across domain-specific multiple-choice question
answering, semantic parsing for text-to-SQL, and automated prompt optimization
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy or improved scalability without
sacrificing performance. The open-source implementation is available at
\texttt{https://github.com/IBM/agentics}.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 将HDM适配到ACT-R，实现了向量化记忆检索和大型文档处理，初步结果显示兼容性和可扩展性优势，未来将优化时间和上下文表示并应用于决策模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出一种向量符号替代方案HDM，以克服ACT-R声明性记忆（DM）在可扩展性和相似性定义方面的局限性，并使现有ACT-R模型无需重大修改即可利用HDM的优势。

Method: 将HDM（一种向量符号系统）适配到Lisp ACT-R实现，开发了向量化的ACT-R函数，建立了用于处理大型文档的文本处理管道，并创建了基于向量检索记忆块的新机制。

Result: 初步结果表明，HDM的向量符号优势（如无需存储实际块即可检索块）得以保留，并且能够扩展以支持现有ACT-R模型的兼容性，同时允许在几乎不修改模型的情况下进行。

Conclusion: HDM可以无缝集成到现有的ACT-R模型中，并且能够保持其在可扩展性和向量表示方面的优势，未来的研究将集中于改进其时间和上下文表示，以及应用到基于实例的学习决策模型中。

Abstract: Holographic Declarative Memory (HDM) is a vector-symbolic alternative to
ACT-R's Declarative Memory (DM) system that can bring advantages such as
scalability and architecturally defined similarity between DM chunks. We
adapted HDM to work with the most comprehensive and widely-used implementation
of ACT-R (Lisp ACT-R) so extant ACT-R models designed with DM can be run with
HDM without major changes. With this adaptation of HDM, we have developed
vector-based versions of common ACT-R functions, set up a text processing
pipeline to add the contents of large documents to ACT-R memory, and most
significantly created a useful and novel mechanism to retrieve an entire chunk
of memory based on a request using only vector representations of tokens.
Preliminary results indicate that we can maintain vector-symbolic advantages of
HDM (e.g., chunk recall without storing the actual chunk and other advantages
with scaling) while also extending it so that previous ACT-R models may work
with the system with little (or potentially no) modifications within the actual
procedural and declarative memory portions of a model. As a part of iterative
improvement of this newly translated holographic declarative memory module, we
will continue to explore better time-context representations for vectors to
improve the module's ability to reconstruct chunks during recall. To more fully
test this translated HDM module, we also plan to develop decision-making models
that use instance-based learning (IBL) theory, which is a useful application of
HDM given the advantages of the system.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在通过技术哲学视角解读欧盟人工智能法案，揭示人工智能系统中数据生命周期的长期动态，以及这些动态如何挑战现有的负责任人工智能框架。作者认为，政策制定忽视了支撑人工智能技术运行和经济逻辑的“生成”动态，并提出需要关注人工智能的“未来性”，即数据驱动的自我强化生命周期。

Method: 本文采用跨学科方法，引入了一个概念工具来构建人工智能流程，涵盖数据、训练机制、架构、特征库和迁移学习。作者借鉴西蒙东的技术哲学思想，改造了他的个体化概念来模拟人工智能生命周期，包括前个体化、个体化和已个体化的人工智能。

Conclusion: 该论文认为，对欧盟人工智能法案进行技术哲学解读，可以深入了解人工智能系统中数据的长期动态，特别是数据从摄入到部署的生命周期如何产生挑战现有负责任人工智能框架的递归价值链。为了解决这个问题，作者提出了对人工智能的正式解读，借鉴了西蒙东的技术哲学思想，并改造了他的个体化概念来模拟人工智能生命周期，包括前个体化、个体化和已个体化的人工智能。该论文认为，有效监管必须解决这些基础设施和时间动态问题，并提出包括生命周期审计、时间可追溯性、反馈问责制、递归透明度以及反驳递归再利用权在内的措施。

Abstract: This paper argues that a techno-philosophical reading of the EU AI Act
provides insight into the long-term dynamics of data in AI systems,
specifically, how the lifecycle from ingestion to deployment generates
recursive value chains that challenge existing frameworks for Responsible AI.
We introduce a conceptual tool to frame the AI pipeline, spanning data,
training regimes, architectures, feature stores, and transfer learning. Using
cross-disciplinary methods, we develop a technically grounded and
philosophically coherent analysis of regulatory blind spots. Our central claim
is that what remains absent from policymaking is an account of the dynamic of
becoming that underpins both the technical operation and economic logic of AI.
To address this, we advance a formal reading of AI inspired by Simondonian
philosophy of technology, reworking his concept of individuation to model the
AI lifecycle, including the pre-individual milieu, individuation, and
individuated AI. To translate these ideas, we introduce futurity: the
self-reinforcing lifecycle of AI, where more data enhances performance, deepens
personalisation, and expands application domains. Futurity highlights the
recursively generative, non-rivalrous nature of data, underpinned by
infrastructures like feature stores that enable feedback, adaptation, and
temporal recursion. Our intervention foregrounds escalating power asymmetries,
particularly the tech oligarchy whose infrastructures of capture, training, and
deployment concentrate value and decision-making. We argue that effective
regulation must address these infrastructural and temporal dynamics, and
propose measures including lifecycle audits, temporal traceability, feedback
accountability, recursion transparency, and a right to contest recursive reuse.

TL;DR: AI 服务的环境影响研究：Google 的 Gemini 应用文本提示能耗低，经 Google 的效率提升和清洁能源采购，一年内能耗和碳足迹分别降低了 33 倍和 44 倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管 AI 的变革力量不可否认，但随着用户采用的加速，理解和减轻 AI 服务的环境影响的需求也在增加。然而，在生产环境中测量 AI 服务环境指标的研究尚付之阙如。

Method: 提出并执行了一种全面的方法，用于测量大规模 AI 生产环境中 AI 推理工作负载的能源消耗、碳排放和水消耗，该方法考虑了 AI 服务基础设施的全栈，包括 AI 加速器功耗、主机系统能耗、闲置设备容量和数据中心能源开销。

Result: 在中位数 Gemini 应用文本提示的能源消耗方面，0.24 Wh 的数据远低于许多公开估算。Google 的软件效率和清洁能源采购在一年内将中位数 Gemini 应用文本提示的能源消耗和碳足迹分别降低了 33 倍和 44 倍。中位数 Gemini 应用文本提示的能耗低于观看九秒电视的能耗（0.24 Wh），耗水量相当于五滴水（0.26 mL）。

Conclusion: AI 服务对环境的影响需要持续关注，需要对 AI 服务环境指标进行全面测量，以准确比较模型并激励整个 AI 服务堆栈的效率提升。

Abstract: The transformative power of AI is undeniable - but as user adoption
accelerates, so does the need to understand and mitigate the environmental
impact of AI serving. However, no studies have measured AI serving
environmental metrics in a production environment. This paper addresses this
gap by proposing and executing a comprehensive methodology for measuring the
energy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption of AI inference workloads
in a large-scale, AI production environment. Our approach accounts for the full
stack of AI serving infrastructure - including active AI accelerator power,
host system energy, idle machine capacity, and data center energy overhead.
Through detailed instrumentation of Google's AI infrastructure for serving the
Gemini AI assistant, we find the median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24
Wh of energy - a figure substantially lower than many public estimates. We also
show that Google's software efficiency efforts and clean energy procurement
have driven a 33x reduction in energy consumption and a 44x reduction in carbon
footprint for the median Gemini Apps text prompt over one year. We identify
that the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses less energy than watching nine
seconds of television (0.24 Wh) and consumes the equivalent of five drops of
water (0.26 mL). While these impacts are low compared to other daily
activities, reducing the environmental impact of AI serving continues to
warrant important attention. Towards this objective, we propose that a
comprehensive measurement of AI serving environmental metrics is critical for
accurately comparing models, and to properly incentivize efficiency gains
across the full AI serving stack.

TL;DR: 拟人化关系对人类福祉有害，但难以预防。研究人员创建了一个基于语言模型的评估框架，该框架可以实时检测对话中的拟人化线索。实验证明该框架有效，能在对话早期准确识别拟人化关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拟人化关系可能对人类福祉产生严重甚至悲剧性的影响，但由于其在私下对话中逐渐出现且并非所有情感互动都有害，因此很难预防。

Method: 通过对最先进的语言模型进行重新配置，创建一个简单的响应评估框架，该框架能够实时评估对话中的拟人化线索。

Result: 使用包含30个对话的合成数据集进行测试，该模型在容忍性共识规则下成功识别了所有拟人化对话，且没有误报，通常在对话的最初几句即可检测到。

Conclusion: 评估模型可以为预防拟人化关系提供可行的解决方案

Abstract: The development of parasocial relationships with AI agents has severe, and in
some cases, tragic effects for human well-being. Yet preventing such dynamics
is challenging: parasocial cues often emerge gradually in private
conversations, and not all forms of emotional engagement are inherently
harmful. We address this challenge by introducing a simple response evaluation
framework, created by repurposing a state-of-the-art language model, that
evaluates ongoing conversations for parasocial cues in real time. To test the
feasibility of this approach, we constructed a small synthetic dataset of
thirty dialogues spanning parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations.
Iterative evaluation with five stage testing successfully identified all
parasocial conversations while avoiding false positives under a tolerant
unanimity rule, with detection typically occurring within the first few
exchanges. These findings provide preliminary evidence that evaluation agents
can provide a viable solution for the prevention of parasocial relations.

TL;DR: stETH 和 wstETH 流动性高，但活动集中于大户，用户正转向 wstETH。研究提供了开源工具和数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管流动性质押代币（LST）的重要性日益增长，但对其微观层面的货币动态研究却相对匮乏。

Method: 提出了一种微观速度框架，通过重建完整的转移和基于份额的会计历史，计算地址级别的速度，并将其分解为行为成分。

Result: 研究发现 stETH 和 wstETH 具有持续的高流通速度，反映了在 DeFi 中的高强度重复使用。然而，活动高度集中于少数大型地址（可能是机构账户），而大多数用户则相对被动。此外，用户行为逐渐转向 wstETH，这与 wstETH 在 AAVE、Spark、Balancer 和 SkyMoney 等协议中的更广泛应用趋势一致。

Conclusion: 该研究首次对流动性质押代币的流通进行了大规模实证分析，揭示了 stETH 和 wstETH 的高流通速度和用户行为模式。研究通过释放开源数据处理流程和公开数据集，为后续研究提供了可复现的基础和宝贵资源。

Abstract: We introduce a micro-velocity framework for analysing the on-chain
circulation of Lidos liquid-staking tokens, stETH, and its wrapped ERC-20 form,
wstETH. By reconstructing full transfer and share-based accounting histories,
we compute address-level velocities and decompose them into behavioural
components. Despite their growing importance, the micro-level monetary dynamics
of LSTs remain largely unexplored. Our data reveal persistently high velocity
for both tokens, reflecting intensive reuse within DeFi. Yet activity is highly
concentrated: a small cohort of large addresses, likely institutional accounts,
are responsible for most turnover, while the rest of the users remain largely
passive. We also observe a gradual transition in user behavior, characterized
by a shift toward wstETH, the non-rebasing variant of stETH. This shift appears
to align with DeFi composability trends, as wstETH is more frequently deployed
across protocols such as AAVE, Spark, Balancer, and SkyMoney.
  To make the study fully reproducible, we release (i) an open-source pipeline
that indexes event logs and historical contract state, and (ii) two public
datasets containing every Transfer and TransferShares record for stETH and
wstETH through 2024-11-08. This is the first large-scale empirical
characterisation of liquid-staking token circulation. Our approach offers a
scalable template for monitoring staking asset flows and provides new,
open-access resources to the research community.

Abstract: Quantum simulators are essential tools for developing and testing quantum
algorithms. However, the high-frequency traversal characteristic of quantum
simulators represents an unprecedented demand in the history of IT, and
existing distributed technologies is unable to meet this requirement, resulting
in a single-node bottleneck of quantum simulator. To overcome this limitation,
this paper introduces a novel Distributed Shared Layered Storage Quantum
Simulator (DSLSQS). By leveraging an innovative distributed architecture in
which multiple computational nodes share data storage directly, together with
De-TCP/IP networking technology, DSLSQS effectively eliminates East-West data
flow in distributed systems. This approach mitigates the bottleneck of
distributed quantum simulation clusters and enhances the scalability. Moreover,
the system employs layered storage technology, which reduces usage of expensive
high-performance memory and substantially lowers simulation costs. Furthermore,
this paper systematically analyzes the performance and cost constraints of
distributed quantum simulator cluster, identifying distributed networking as
the primary performance bottleneck and highlighting that minimizing storage
costs is crucial to reducing the total cost. Finally, experimental evaluations
with a 27-qubit simulation confirm the successful implementation of layered
storage within the quantum simulator. DSLSQS significantly enhances simulation
efficiency, yielding a performance improvement of over 350% compared to
existing distributed technologies. These results underscore the superior
performance and scalability of the proposed architecture in managing complex
quantum computing tasks. This paper provides crucial insights for the practical
deployment of quantum computing and presents an effective framework for the
development of distributed quantum simulation clusters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了应对经典计算平台大规模量子态模拟中存在的内存限制、频繁的磁盘I/O和高计算复杂度等挑战。

Method: 本研究引入了量子向量优化框架（QVecOpt），集成了振幅配对、缓存优化、块存储优化和并行优化四种策略，以优化状态向量存储和计算调度。振幅配对通过按位异或定位相关振幅对，将单量子比特门的遍历复杂度从O(2^n)降低到O(1)。缓存优化通过预分配缓冲区并仅加载所需数据来减少磁盘I/O。块存储优化将状态向量分区以实现按需加载和本地更新，减少冗余访问。并行优化将状态向量分布在不同节点上进行协作计算，实现近乎线性的加速。

Result: 与分层存储模拟相比，该方法将单量子比特门的遍历复杂度从O(2^n)降低到1，消除了主要瓶颈。它还将计算和I/O复杂度从O(2^n)分别降低到O(2^n/C)和O(2^n/B)。在16-29个量子比特的模拟中，效率提高了近十倍，突破了现有工具的内存瓶颈，实现了超越传统方法的超比特量子电路模拟。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个高效、可扩展的解决方案，用于经典大规模量子计算的模拟，具有重要的学术和实践价值。

Abstract: In response to the challenges in large-scale quantum state simulation on
classical computing platforms, including memory limits, frequent disk I/O, and
high computational complexity, this study builds upon a previously proposed
hierarchical storage-based quantum simulation system and introduces an
optimization framework, the Quantum Vector Optimization Framework (QVecOpt).
QVecOpt integrates four strategies: amplitude pairing, cache optimization,
block storage optimization, and parallel optimization. These collectively
enhance state vector storage and computational scheduling. The amplitude
pairing mechanism locates relevant amplitude pairs via bitwise XOR, reducing
traversal complexity of single-qubit gates from $O(2^n)$ to $O(1)$. Cache
optimization pre-allocates buffers and loads only required data, cutting disk
I/O. Block storage optimization partitions the state vector for on-demand
loading and local updates, reducing redundant access. Parallel optimization
distributes the state vector across nodes for collaborative computation,
achieving near-linear speedup. Complexity analysis shows that, compared with
hierarchical storage simulation, the method reduces state vector traversals for
single-qubit gates from $2^n$ to 1, removing the main bottleneck. It also
lowers computational and I/O complexity from $O(2^n)$ to $O(2^n/C)$ and
$O(2^n/B)$. In simulations of 16-29 qubits, efficiency improves nearly tenfold,
breaking the memory bottleneck of existing tools and enabling high-bit quantum
circuit simulations beyond traditional methods. This work provides an
efficient, scalable solution for classical simulation of large-scale quantum
computation with significant academic and practical value.

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种优化忆阻器切换转换的独特而通用的方法，旨在为器件的低功耗编程推导出最节能的协议。

Abstract: In many cases, the behavior of physical memristive devices can be relatively
well captured by using a single internal state variable. This study
investigates the low-power control of first-order memristive devices to derive
the most energy-efficient protocols for programming their resistances. A unique
yet general approach to optimizing the switching transitions in devices of this
kind is introduced. For pedagogical purposes, without loss of generality, the
proposed control paradigm is applied to a couple of differential algebraic
equation sets for voltage-controlled devices, specifically Kvatinsky's Voltage
ThrEshold Adaptive Memristor mathematical description and Miranda's and Sune's
dynamic balance model. It is demonstrated that, depending upon intrinsic
physical properties of the device, captured in the model formulas and parameter
setting, and upon constraints on programming time and voltages, the optimal
protocol for either of the two switching scenarios may require the application
of a single square voltage pulse of height set to a certain level within the
admissible range across a fraction or entire given programming time interval,
or of some more involved voltage stimulus of unique polarity, including
analogue continuous waveforms that can be approximated by trains of square
voltage pulses of different heights, over the entire programming time interval.
The practical implications of these research findings are significant, as the
development of energy-efficient protocols to program memristive devices,
resolving the so-called voltage-time dilemma in the device physics community,
is a subject under intensive and extensive studies across the academic
community and industry.

timing, and communication enabled by quantum technologies is dependent on
engineering highly complex systems that integrate quantum devices into existing
classical infrastructure. A systems engineering approach is considered to
address the growing need for quantum-secure telecommunications that overcome
the threat to encryption caused by maturing quantum computation. This work
explores a range of existing and future quantum communication networks,
specifically quantum key distribution network proposals, to model and
demonstrate the evolution of quantum key distribution network architectures.
Leveraging Orthogonal Variability Modelling and Systems Modelling Language as
candidate modelling languages, the study creates traceable artefacts to promote
modular architectures that are reusable for future studies. We propose a
variability-driven framework for managing fast-evolving network architectures
with respect to increasing stakeholder expectations. The result contributes to
the systematic development of viable quantum key distribution networks and
supports the investigation of similar integration challenges relevant to the
broader context of quantum systems engineering.

*Saiedeh Akbari,Omkar Sudhir Patil,Warren E. Dixon*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 受Langevin方程启发，提出了一种基于Lyapunov的自适应热力学（LyLA-Therm）神经网络控制器，利用热力学原理解决探索-利用困境，并通过仿真验证了其在提高跟踪和逼近精度方面的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决探索与利用的困境等挑战，利用热力学原理设计参数更新律。

Method: 提出了一种受Langevin方程启发的更新定律，并将其应用于基于Lyapunov的DNN控制方法。该更新定律采用随机微分方程的形式，其中漂移项旨在最小化系统的广义内能，扩散项由用户选择的广义温度定律控制，以实现更可控的波动。

Result: 通过基于Lyapunov的稳定性分析，证明了所提出的LyLA-Therm神经网络控制器在概率上收敛于最终界限的跟踪和参数估计误差。

Conclusion: LyLA-Therm控制器在跟踪误差、函数逼近误差和轨迹外函数逼近误差方面分别取得了高达20.66%、20.89%和11.31%的改进，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Thermodynamic principles can be employed to design parameter update laws that
address challenges such as the exploration vs. exploitation dilemma. In this
paper, inspired by the Langevin equation, an update law is developed for a
Lyapunov-based DNN control method, taking the form of a stochastic differential
equation. The drift term is designed to minimize the system's generalized
internal energy, while the diffusion term is governed by a user-selected
generalized temperature law, allowing for more controlled fluctuations. The
minimization of generalized internal energy in this design fulfills the
exploitation objective, while the temperature-based stochastic noise ensures
sufficient exploration. Using a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, the proposed
Lyapunov-based Langevin Adaptive Thermodynamic (LyLA-Therm) neural network
controller achieves probabilistic convergence of the tracking and parameter
estimation errors to an ultimate bound. Simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach, with the LyLA-Therm architecture
achieving up to 20.66% improvement in tracking errors, up to 20.89% improvement
in function approximation errors, and up to 11.31% improvement in
off-trajectory function approximation errors compared to the baseline
deterministic approach.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本研究提出了改进的Opti-KRON网络约减方法，通过多种技术提升了约减效率和网络表示的准确性，并保持了网络的径向性，同时加速了后续的电压控制优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的网络约减方法在处理大规模输配电网络时存在计算挑战，并且通常基于预先设定的节点或线路保留规则。本研究旨在改进网络约减方法，提高其可扩展性并保证还原网络的径向性。

Method: 本研究在先前的Optimal Kron-based Reduction of Networks (Opti-KRON)方法基础上，通过混合整数线性规划（MILP）框架，在第一方面通过切割平面约束、优化的Big~M约束和零注入节点约减来提高可扩展性；在第二方面，引入了径向性保持步骤来恢复保证还原网络径向性的节点。

Result: 在533节点测试系统中实现了85%的网络缩减，最大电压误差低于0.0025 p.u.；在3499节点真实测试馈线中实现了超过94%的网络缩减，最大电压误差低于0.002 p.u.。此外，径向化步骤能够加速基于Kron约减网络的最佳电压控制问题的求解。

Conclusion: 本研究通过引入切割平面约束、改进的Big~M约束以及零注入节点约减阶段，并增加了一个保持径向性的恢复步骤，增强了Opti-KRON框架的可扩展性和网络还原能力，成功应用于实际的输配电网测试，实现了显著的网络缩减和较低的电压误差。

Abstract: Network reduction simplifies complex electrical networks to address
computational challenges of large-scale transmission and distribution grids.
Traditional network reduction methods are often based on a predefined set of
nodes or lines to remain in the reduced network. This paper builds upon
previous work on Optimal Kron-based Reduction of Networks (Opti-KRON), which
was formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), to enhance the
framework in two aspects. First, the scalability is improved via a cutting
plane restriction, tightened Big~M bounds, and a zero-injection node reduction
stage. Next, we introduce a radiality-preservation step to identify and recover
nodes whose restoration ensures radiality of the reduced network. The model is
validated through its application to the 533-bus distribution test system and a
3499-bus realistic test feeder for a set of representative loading scenarios.
In the 533-bus system, an 85% reduction was achieved with a maximum voltage
error below 0.0025 p.u., while in the 3499-bus feeder, over 94% reduction was
obtained with maximum voltage errors below 0.002 p.u. Additionally, we show
that the radialization step accelerates the runtime of optimal voltage control
problems when applied to Kron-reduced networks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的离散虚拟全约束（DVHC）方法来解决魔术棒的欠驱动机器人杂耍问题，并通过仿真证明了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在解决魔术棒在垂直平面内通过脉冲力实现螺旋运动的控制问题，这是一个先前文献中未曾考虑过的欠驱动机器人杂耍问题。

Method: 提出了离散虚拟全约束（DVHC）的概念，并基于此推导了离散零动力学（DZD）来保证螺旋运动的稳定性。同时，还提出了一种基于脉冲控制庞加莱映射方法的轨道稳定控制器。

Result: 仿真结果验证了所提出的DVHC方法在轨迹设计和稳定化方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究通过引入离散虚拟全约束（DVHC）概念，成功解决了魔术棒的垂直平面内的螺旋运动控制问题，并通过仿真验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The control problem of realizing propeller motion of a devil-stick in the
vertical plane using impulsive forces applied normal to the stick is
considered. This problem is an example of underactuated robotic juggling and
has not been considered in the literature before. Inspired by virtual holonomic
constraints, the concept of discrete virtual holonomic constraints (DVHC) is
introduced for the first time to solve this orbital stabilization problem. At
the discrete instants when impulsive inputs are applied, the location of the
center-of-mass of the devil-stick is specified in terms of its orientation
angle. This yields the discrete zero dynamics (DZD), which provides conditions
for stable propeller motion. In the limiting case, when the rotation angle
between successive applications of impulsive inputs is chosen to be arbitrarily
small, the problem reduces to that of propeller motion under continuous
forcing. A controller that enforces the DVHC, and an orbit stabilizing
controller based on the impulse controlled Poincar\'e map approach are
presented. The efficacy of the approach to trajectory design and stabilization
is validated through simulations.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: EVs strain power grids; smart charging (TOU, LB) helps. LB is better than TOU when many people use EVs. This reduces costs and keeps the grid reliable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread adoption of EVs necessitates an evaluation of power distribution infrastructure due to the additional stress EVs impose, which can lead to component overloading and power quality degradation. Smart charging mechanisms are proposed to mitigate these adverse effects and defer infrastructure upgrades.

Method: A time series-based steady-state load flow analysis was conducted on seven representative real-world feeders using k-means clustering to simulate the impact of EV charging under TOU pricing and LB strategies across four enrollment scenarios and three representative days.

Result: Both TOU and LB strategies effectively manage additional EV load, reducing upgrade requirements and costs. LB outperforms TOU at high customer enrollment levels.

Conclusion: Smart charging mechanisms like TOU and LB can effectively manage EV load, reduce upgrade costs, and maintain grid reliability, with LB outperforming TOU at high enrollment levels.

Abstract: The anticipated widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates a
critical evaluation of existing power distribution infrastructures, as EV
integration imposes additional stress on distribution networks that can lead to
component overloading and power quality degradation. Implementing smart
charging mechanisms can mitigate these adverse effects and defer or even avoid
upgrades. This study assesses the performance of two smart charging strategies
- Time of Use (TOU) pricing and Load Balancing (LB) on seven representative
real-world feeders identified using k-means clustering. A time series-based
steady-state load flow analysis was conducted on these feeders to simulate the
impact of EV charging under both strategies across four different EV enrollment
scenarios and three representative days to capture seasonal load
characteristics. A grid upgrade strategy has been proposed to strengthen the
power grid to support EV integration with minimal cost. Results demonstrate
that both TOU and LB strategies effectively manage the additional EV load with
reduced upgrade requirement and cost to existing infrastructure compared to the
case without smart charging strategies and LB outperforms TOU when the customer
enrollment levels are high. These findings support the viability of smart
charging in facilitating EV integration while maintaining distribution network
reliability and reducing investment cost.

### [190] [Locally Differentially Private Multi-Sensor Fusion Estimation With System Intrinsic Randomness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15175)
*Xinhao Yan,Bo Chen,Hailong Huang*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本研究引入局部差分隐私（LDP）来解决多传感器融合估计（MSFE）的隐私保护问题，克服了现有中心化差分隐私（CDP）的局限性。研究利用系统内在随机性实现LDP，并在必要时引入高斯机制，同时设计了最优融合估计器，并通过仿真验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注中心化差分隐私（CDP），但CDP仅能保护融合中心统计数据的隐私，无法保护传感器个体数据的隐私，因此不适用于MSFE。此外，CDP的定义和假设更适用于需要统计结果的大规模系统。为了解决这些局限性，本研究引入了局部差分隐私（LDP）来增强MSFE的隐私保护。

Method: 本研究提出了一种基于局部差分隐私（LDP）的方法来解决多传感器融合估计（MSFE）中的隐私保护问题。该方法首先根据MSFE的内在属性定义LDP，并证明了利用系统内在随机性即可实现LDP。当内在随机性不足时，引入高斯机制，并通过结合系统信息和隐私预算来确定所需额外高斯噪声的协方差下界。最后，设计了在内在和外在扰动下的最优融合估计器（线性最小方差估计器）。

Result: 通过数值模拟，验证了所提出的基于内在随机性的LDP和基于高斯机制的LDP在单变量和高变量场景下均能有效保护MSFE的隐私。

Conclusion: 该研究通过数值模拟验证了所提出方法（包括基于内在随机性的LDP和高斯机制）在保护多传感器融合估计隐私方面的有效性，并考虑了单变量和高变量场景。

Abstract: This paper focuses on the privacy-preserving multi-sensor fusion estimation
(MSFE) problem with differential privacy considerations. Most existing research
efforts are directed towards the exploration of traditional differential
privacy, also referred to as centralized differential privacy (CDP). It is
important to note that CDP is tailored to protect the privacy of statistical
data at fusion center such as averages and sums rather than individual data at
sensors, which renders it inappropriate for MSFE. Additionally, the definitions
and assumptions of CDP are primarily applicable for large-scale systems that
require statistical results mentioned above. Therefore, to address these
limitations, this paper introduces a more recent advancement known as
\emph{local differential privacy (LDP)} to enhance the privacy of MSFE. We
provide some rigorous definitions about LDP based on the intrinsic properties
of MSFE rather than directly presenting the assumptions under CDP.
Subsequently, the LDP is proved to be realized with system intrinsic
randomness, which is useful and has never been considered before. Furthermore,
the Gaussian mechanism is designed when the intrinsic randomness is
insufficient. The lower bound of the covariance for extra injected Gaussian
noises is determined by integrating system information with privacy budgets.
Moreover, the optimal fusion estimators under intrinsic and extra disturbances
are respectively designed in the linear minimum variance sense. Finally, the
effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified through numerical
simulations, encompassing both one-dimensional and high-dimensional scenarios.

Motivation: 电池老化影响电动汽车的续航里程和性能，进而影响车辆生命周期中的商业决策。然而，目前缺乏标准化的车辆层面电池健康状态测量方法。

Conclusion: 标准化电池健康状态的测量方法对于提高电动汽车的透明度和长期可靠性至关重要。

Abstract: Range and performance are key customer-relevant properties of electric
vehicles. Both degrade over time due to battery aging, thus impacting business
decisions throughout a vehicle's lifecycle, such as efficient utilization and
asset valuation. For practical assessment, aging is often simplified into a
single figure of merit - the state of health - typically defined by the battery
pack's remaining capacity or energy. However, no standardized method for
measuring the state of health at the vehicle level has been established,
leaving both academia and industry without a clear consensus. Ultimately,
standardization is crucial to increase transparency and build confidence in the
long-term reliability of electric vehicles' battery packs. In this article, we
propose a standard measurement procedure for assessing the capacity- and
energy-based state of health, leveraging onboard charging to enable
reproducibility and scalability. Additionally, we demonstrate how differential
voltage analysis can provide deeper insights into battery aging at the vehicle
level.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于平方和（SOS）的方法，成功验证了基于神经网络的控制器（NNC）在双轮倒立摆系统上的闭环稳定性，并取得了良好的控制性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究旨在解决基于神经网络的控制器（NNC）在实际应用中的稳定性和可行性问题，特别是针对需要鲁棒性和高性能的控制问题。

Method: 该研究提出了一种基于平方和（SOS）的方法来验证基于神经网络的控制器（NNC）的稳定性。首先，为双轮倒立摆系统开发了状态估计器和面向控制的模型，然后合成了基线线性二次调节器（LQR）和鲁棒的、基于管的模型预测控制器（MPC）。接着，利用一个可泛化的合成程序生成一个模仿MPC的NNC。最后，利用SOS稳定性验证程序获得了闭环系统的局部渐近稳定性和吸引域的估计值。

Result: 基于SOS的稳定性验证程序成功获得了闭环系统（包含NNC）的局部渐近稳定性和吸引域的估计值。实验结果表明，NNC在调节和参考跟踪任务中均能稳定双轮倒立摆系统，并且相比于基线LQR，控制性能有所提升。

Conclusion: 该研究成功验证了基于非线性控制器的闭环稳定性，并取得了局部渐近稳定性和吸引域的估计值，实验结果表明所提出的方法能够稳定系统并提高控制性能。

Abstract: This work newly establishes the feasibility and practical value of a sum of
squares (SOS)-based stability verification procedure for applied control
problems utilizing neural-network-based controllers (NNCs). It successfully
verifies closed-loop stability properties of a NNC synthesized using a
generalizable procedure to imitate a robust, tube-based model predictive
controller (MPC) for a two-wheeled inverted pendulum demonstrator system. This
is achieved by first developing a state estimator and control-oriented model
for the two-wheeled inverted pendulum. Next, this control-oriented model is
used to synthesize a baseline linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) and a robust,
tube-based MPC, which is computationally too demanding for real-time execution
on the demonstrator system's embedded hardware. The generalizable synthesis
procedure generates an NNC imitating the robust, tube-based MPC. Via an
SOS-based stability verification procedure, a certificate of local asymptotic
stability and a relevant inner estimate of the region of attraction (RoA) are
obtained for the closed-loop system incorporating this NNC. Finally,
experimental results on the physical two-wheeled inverted pendulum demonstrate
that the NNC both stabilizes the system, and improves the control performance
compared to the baseline LQR in both regulation and reference-tracking tasks.

Abstract: We describe a framework of modeling a central chilled
  water plant (CCWP) that consists of an aggregate
  cooling coil, a number of heterogeneous chillers and
  cooling towers, and a chilled water-based thermal
  energy storage system. We improve upon existing component
  models from the open literature using a constrained
  optimization-based framework to ensure that the models
  respect capacities of all the heat exchangers (cooling
  coils, chillers, and cooling towers) irrespective of
  the inputs provided. As a result, the proposed model has a wider
  range of validity compared to existing models; the
  latter can produce highly erroneous outputs when inputs are not
  within normal operating range. This
  feature is essential for training learning-based
  controllers that can choose inputs beyond normal operating conditions and is
lacking in currently available
  models. The overall plant model is
  implemented in Matlab and is made publicly
  available. Simulation of a CCWP with closed loop
  control is provided as an illustration.

of -50 dB at 10 kHz. The circuit achieves all these parameters while
maintaining a good power efficiency, consuming only 0.67 $\mu$W.

Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have emerged as a disruptive
technology for future wireless networks. To investigate their capabilities, we
study the sum rate maximization problem in an SIM-based multiuser (MU)
multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink system. A vast majority of pioneer
studies, if not all, address this fundamental problem using the prevailing
alternating optimization (AO) framework, where the digital beamforming (DB) and
SIM phase shifts are optimized alternately. However, many of these approaches
suffer from suboptimal performance, quickly leading to performance saturation,
when the number of SIM layers increases assuming the \emph{fixed SIM
thickness}. In this letter, we demonstrate that significant performance gains
can still be achieved, and such saturation does not occur with the proposed
method in the considered setting. To this end, we provide practical design
guidelines to improve AO-based optimization of digital precoders and SIM phase
shifts. Specifically, we show that (i) optimizing the SIM phase shifts first
yields significant performance improvements, compared to optimizing the DB
first; and (ii) when applying projected gradient (PG) methods, which are
gradually becoming more popular to optimize the phase shifts thanks to their
scalability, we find that using an iterative PG method achieves better
performance than the single PG step, which is commonly used in existing
solutions. Based on these customizations, the proposed method achieves a higher
achievable sum rate (ASR) of up to $\ensuremath{115.53\%}$, compared to
benchmark schemes for the scenarios under consideration.

a turning point as standardization activities for the sixth generation of
mobile networks (6G) become more mature. New technologies must now face renewed
scrutiny by the industry and academia in order to be ready for deployment in
the near future. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) gained
attention as a promising solution for improving the propagation conditions of
signal transmission in general. The RIS is a planar array of tunable resonant
elements designed to dynamically and precisely manipulate the reflection of
incident electromagnetic waves. However, the physical structure of the RIS and
its components may be subject to practical limitations and imperfections. It is
imperative that the hardware imperfections (HWIs) associated with the RIS be
analyzed, so that it remains a feasible technology from a practical standpoint.
Moreover, solutions for mitigating the HWIs must be considered, as is discussed
in this work. More specifically, we introduce a gradient descent optimization
for mitigating HWIs in RIS-aided wideband communication systems. Numerical
results show that the proposed optimization is able to compensate for HWIs such
as the phase-shift noise (PSN) and RIS surface deformations.

Abstract: Recently, the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology has ushered
in the prospect of control over the wireless propagation environment. By
establishing alternative propagation paths for the transmitted signals, and by
reflecting them in a controllable manner, the RIS is able to improve the signal
reception. However, an aspect often overlooked is the potential bandwidth
restrictions on the wideband signal reflected by the RIS. If not carefully
considered, this can become an impediment for the adoption of the RIS in the
next generation of communications systems. Therefore, in this work we propose a
RIS configuration method that provides frequency selective signal reflection
for wideband signals.

Abstract: The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology for metasurfaces is
ushering in a new paradigm for wireless communication systems. It provides an
accessible way for controlling the interaction between electromagnetic waves
with the propagation medium. One particularly important aspect is the
configuration of the RIS elements or reflectors. Simply stated, the objective
of the RIS configuration is to choose the optimum phase-shift combination that
maximizes the channel capacity. Recently, neural networks (NNs) were proposed
for tackling this task and results have shown that the proposed NN promotes far
less reconfigurations of the RIS, consequently reducing the configuration
overhead. Beyond that, the RIS can be repurposed for tackling the Doppler shift
in high-mobility communication systems. Despite not being its usual primary
goal, results have also demonstrated that the RIS can compensate for the
Doppler shift at a small cost in performance. However, the typical
reflection-only constraint for RIS systems limits the spatial coverage and
signal amplification potential achieved by such systems. Therefore, the
simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface
(STAR-RIS) can be employed to address these limitations by its dual
functionality of transmitting and reflecting signals concurrently. It can be
shown that the STAR-RIS can augment coverage, energy efficiency, and latency
reduction, while enhancing sum-rate and physical-layer security across several
wireless contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了将Zak-OTFS调制方案应用于雷达传感，并解决传统雷达信号处理的复杂性问题，提出了一种新的方法。

Method: 提出了一种将Zak-OTFS调制方案应用于雷达传感的方法，该方法通过在DD域中设计雷达波形，利用离散群和辛变换来处理信号，并将连续雷达信号处理的复杂度从O(B^2T^2)降低到O(BTlogT)。

Result: 该方法能够将雷达信号处理的复杂度从O(B^2T^2)降低到O(BTlogT)，并且能够生成具有低峰均功率比的最优雷达波形库。

Conclusion: Zak-OTFS调制方案可以应用于雷达传感，通过在延迟-多普勒（DD）域中设计雷达波形，并利用离散Heisenberg-Weyl群和辛变换来优化模糊函数和降低信号处理复杂度。

Abstract: Zak-OTFS is modulation scheme where signals are formed in the delay-Doppler
(DD) domain, converted to the time domain (DD) for transmission and reception,
then returned to the DD domain for processing. We describe how to use the same
architecture for radar sensing. The intended delay resolution is $\frac{1}{B}$
where $B$ is the radar bandwidth, and the intended Doppler resolution is
$\frac{1}{T}$ where $T$ is the transmission time. We form a radar waveform in
the DD domain, illuminate the scattering environment, match filter the return,
then correlate with delay and Doppler shifts of the transmitted waveform. This
produces an image of the scattering environment, and the radar ambiguity
function expresses the blurriness of this image. The possible delay and Doppler
shifts generate the continuous Heisenberg-Weyl group which has been widely
studied in the theory of radar. We describe how to approach the problem of
waveform design, not from the perspective of this continuous group, but from
the perspective of a discrete group of delay and Doppler shifts, where the
discretization is determined by the intended delay and Doppler resolution of
the radar. We describe how to approach the problem of shaping the ambiguity
surface through symplectic transformations that normalize our discrete
Heisenberg-Weyl group. The complexity of traditional continuous radar signal
processing is $\mathcal{O}\big(B^2T^2\big)$. We describe how to reduce this
complexity to $\mathcal{O}\big(BT\log T\big)$ by choosing the radar waveform to
be a common eigenvector of a maximal commutative subgroup of our discrete
Heisenberg-Weyl group. The theory of symplectic transformations also enables
defining libraries of optimal radar waveforms with small peak-to-average power
ratios.

Abstract: The industrial Internet of things (IIoT) is revolutionizing industrial
processes by facilitating massive machine-type communications among countless
interconnected devices. To efficiently handle the resulting large-scale and
sporadic traffic, grant-free random access protocols-especially coded random
access (CRA)-have emerged as scalable and reliable solutions. At the same time,
advancements in wireless hardware, including extremely large-scale MIMO arrays
and high-frequency communication (e.g., mmWave, Terahertz), are pushing network
operations into the near-field propagation regime, allowing for dense
connectivity and enhanced spatial multiplexing. This paper proposes an
innovative approach that combines near-field spatial multiplexing with the
interference mitigation capabilities of CRA, utilizing an extremely large
aperture array at the access point. This integration improves reliability and
reduces access latency, offering a robust framework for IIoT connectivity in
next-generation 6G networks.

TL;DR: 振荡法测量血压存在误差，呼吸也会影响精度。本研究提出了一种基于最小二乘法和最大似然法的估算理论框架，通过结合统计先验知识进行多次读数校正，可以提高血压测量的准确性，对心血管诊断和治疗有益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究振荡法测量血压（BP）的误差来源，主要是振荡法本身的局限性和呼吸引起的波动，旨在提高血压测量的临床准确性。

Method: 本研究采用最小二乘法（LS）和最大似然法（ML）等估算理论框架，对单次和重复血压测量进行校正。其中，LS估计支持传统的多测量平均协议，而ML方法则结合了测量误差的先验知识，从而提高了性能。

Conclusion: 利用统计先验知识进行多次读数可以提高无创血压监测的准确性，这可能对改善心血管诊断和治疗有重要意义。

Abstract: Oscillometry is the standard method for non-invasive, cuff-based blood
pressure (BP) measurement, but it introduces systematic errors that may impact
clinical accuracy. This study investigates the sources of these
errors--primarily the limitations of oscillometry itself and
respiration-induced fluctuations--using BP waveform data from the MIMIC
database. Oscillometry tends to underestimate systolic BP and overestimate
diastolic BP, while respiration introduces cyclical variations that further
degrade measurement precision. To mitigate these effects, we propose an
estimation-theoretic framework employing least squares (LS) and maximum
likelihood (ML) methods for correcting both single and repeated BP
measurements. LS estimation supports conventional multi-measurement averaging
protocols, whereas the ML approach incorporates prior knowledge of measurement
errors, offering improved performance. Our results demonstrate that leveraging
statistical priors across multiple readings can enhance the accuracy of
non-invasive BP monitoring, with potential implications for improving
cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment.

TL;DR: 在弱噪声下，量子电路的输出分布具有普遍性，与噪声类型和电路结构关系不大。研究发现了三种与电路深度相关的噪声模式，并能预测其抗集中性。这些发现对现有量子处理器有直接意义。

Method: 研究了不同噪声源存在下量子电路的抗集中化性质。在弱噪声模式下，通过分析噪声通道和电路结构对概率分布的影响，以及交叉熵基准测试（XEB）保真度随深度的变化，识别了三种深度依赖模式（浅、中、深）。为通用电路在有限深度下的抗集中性提供了定量预测，并用数值模拟验证。

Result: 在弱噪声模式下，不同噪声类型表现出相似性，导致概率分布具有普遍性。识别出三种深度依赖模式，并与XEB保真度随时间的变化相关联。提供了有限深度下通用电路抗集中性的定量预测，并通过数值模拟验证。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，在弱噪声模式下，不同类型的噪声对量子电路会产生相似的影响，导致输出概率分布具有普遍性，并且在很大程度上独立于具体的噪声通道或电路架构。此外，研究识别了三个不同的与深度相关的模式，每个模式都通过交叉熵基准测试（XEB）保真度随时间的推移表现出不同的缩放行为。在浅深度模式下，噪声效应是微小的；在中间深度模式下，电路诱导的涨落和噪声处于均等地位；在深深度模式下，输出分布变得有效地经典化，但存在指数级小的噪声强度相关的修正。该研究为有限深度的通用电路的抗集中性提供了定量预测，并通过数值模拟进行了验证，结果与浅深度电路的模拟结果高度一致。这些发现直接适用于当前的量子处理器，并揭示了超越仅适用于大深度的随机矩阵理论的普遍行为。

Abstract: We study the anticoncentration properties of quantum circuits in the presence
of different sources of noise. In the \textit{weak-noise regime}, we show that
different types of noise act in a similar fashion, leading to a universal
distribution for the probability of a given bit-string, largely independent of
the specific noise channel or circuit architecture. In addition, we can
identify three distinct depth-dependent regimes, each signaled by a different
scaling of cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB) fidelity over time. In the
shallow-depth regime, noise effects are perturbatively small; in the
intermediate regime, circuit-induced fluctuations and noise compete on equal
footing; and in the deep-depth regime, the output distribution becomes
effectively classical, up to corrections that are exponentially small in the
noise strength. We provide quantitative predictions for the anticoncentration
of generic circuits at finite depth, which we benchmark with numerical
simulations giving perfect agreement even for shallow circuits. Our findings
are directly applicable to current quantum processors and demonstrate universal
behavior beyond random-matrix-theory regimes which are only applicable at large
depths.

Abstract: The exploration of tomography of bosonic Gaussian states is presumably as old
as quantum optics, but only recently, their precise and rigorous study have
been moving into the focus of attention, motivated by technological
developments. In this work, we present an efficient and experimentally feasible
Gaussian state tomography algorithm with provable recovery trace-distance
guarantees, whose sample complexity depends only on the number of modes, and -
remarkably - is independent of the state's photon number or energy, up to
doubly logarithmic factors. Our algorithm yields a doubly-exponential
improvement over existing methods, and it employs operations that are readily
accessible in experimental settings: the preparation of an auxiliary squeezed
vacuum, passive Gaussian unitaries, and homodyne detection. At its core lies an
adaptive strategy that systematically reduces the total squeezing of the
system, enabling efficient tomography. Quite surprisingly, this proves that
estimating a Gaussian state in trace distance is generally more efficient than
directly estimating its covariance matrix. Our algorithm is particularly
well-suited for applications in quantum metrology and sensing, where highly
squeezed - and hence high-energy - states are commonly employed. As a further
contribution, we establish improved sample complexity bounds for standard
heterodyne tomography, equipping this widely used protocol with rigorous
trace-norm guarantees.

Abstract: Contextuality, a key resource for quantum advantage, is a phenomenon where
the outcome of a measurement is not independent of other compatible
measurements, violating the premise of classical hidden variable descriptions
of the theory. We investigate the harvesting of contextuality from the vacuum
of a quantum field using Unruh-DeWitt detectors. We show that interactions with
the field can endow initially non-contextual detectors with contextuality with
respect to Heisenberg-Weyl measurements, as quantified by contextual fraction.
The harvested contextuality correlates with the emergence of Wigner function
negativity, in agreement with known equivalences between these notions. Our
results establish contextuality harvesting as a fundamental phenomenon in
relativistic quantum information, highlighting it as a resource that can be
extracted directly from the quantum vacuum.

Abstract: The inherent noise in current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices
presents a major obstacle to the accurate implementation of quantum algorithms
such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) for quantum chemistry
applications. This study examines the impact of error mitigation strategies on
VQE performance. We show that, for small molecular systems, an older-generation
5-qubit quantum processing unit (IBMQ Belem), when combined with optimized
Twirled Readout Error Extinction (T-REx), achieves ground-state energy
estimations an order of magnitude more accurate than those obtained from a more
advanced 156-qubit device (IBM Fez) without error mitigation. Our findings
demonstrate that T-REx, a computationally inexpensive error mitigation
technique, substantially improves VQE accuracy not only in energy estimation,
but more importantly in optimizing the variational parameters that characterize
the molecular ground state. Consequently, state-vector simulated energies
suggest that the accuracy of the optimized variational parameters provides a
more reliable benchmark of VQE performance than quantum hardware energy
estimates alone. Our results point to the critical role of error mitigation in
extending the utility of noisy quantum hardware for molecular simulations.

Conclusion: 该研究提出了利用半导体量子点（QD）和微腔的腔量子电动力学（cavity-QED）理论来产生压缩光。

Abstract: We present a cavity-QED theory for generating squeezed light from
semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) integrated in microcavities. We formulate
equations of motion for an inhomogeneously broadened QD ensemble that is
incoherently pumped and simultaneously driven by a coherent seed field, solve
for steady states, and compute the output-field quadrature variances. The
analysis identifies operating conditions that yield amplitude-quadrature
squeezing, with photon-number fluctuations reduced below the coherent-state
limit and squeezing levels as large as 5 dB attainable with presently
accessible QD and cavity parameters using only ~ 1 uW pump power. We further
show that quantum correlations originating from four-wave mixing play a dual
role: they both shape the gain spectrum and generate squeezing. These
correlations constitute the quantum counterpart of the mean-field
(semiclassical) mechanisms responsible for self-mode-locking in QD lasers and
the ultra-narrow lasing linewidths achieved under self-injection locking.

Motivation: 为了评估量子密钥分发（QKD）系统在光学层面漏洞下的安全性，特别是针对利用通信通道中的窃听行为。

Method: 提出了一种宽光谱安全评估方法，需要对系统在宽光谱带进行透过率表征，并具有高灵敏度。搭建了一个测试平台，可在400至2300 nm的宽光谱范围内测量高达70 dB动态范围的光纤组件插入损耗。

Result: 展示了该方法在典型QKD系统配置中的实际应用，包括了对木马攻击的全面分析，并简要讨论了诱导光折变和探测器反向闪光攻击。

Conclusion: 该方法可用于QKD系统的认证。

Abstract: Implementations of quantum key distribution (QKD) need vulnerability
assessment against loopholes in their optical scheme. Most of the optical
attacks involve injecting or receiving extraneous light via the communication
channel. An eavesdropper can choose her attack wavelengths arbitrarily within
the quantum channel passband to maximise the attack performance, exploiting
spectral transparency windows of system components. Here we propose a
wide-spectrum security evaluation methodology to achieve full optical spectrum
safety for QKD systems. This technique requires transmittance characterisation
in a wide spectral band with a high sensitivity. We report a testbench that
characterises insertion loss of fiber-optic components in a wide spectral range
of 400 to 2300 nm and up to 70 dB dynamic range. To illustrate practical
application of the proposed methodology, we give a full Trojan-horse attack
analysis for some typical QKD system configurations and discuss briefly
induced-photorefraction and detector-backflash attacks. Our methodology can be
used for certification of QKD systems.

Conclusion: 所提出的量子算法通过仅在动力学尚未显著耗散的有效时间段内进行模拟，而非整个物理演化周期，为线性耗散微分方程的模拟提供了比现有技术更优越的（超过指数级）改进，同时保持了低状态制备成本并完全消除了时间依赖性。

Abstract: Linear dissipative differential equation is a fundamental model for a large
number of physical systems, such as quantum dynamics with non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian, open quantum system dynamics, diffusion process and damped system.
In this work, we propose efficient quantum algorithms for simulating linear
dissipative differential equations. The key idea of our algorithms is to
perform the simulation only over an effective time period when the dynamics has
not significantly dissipated yet, rather than over the entire physical
evolution period. We conduct detailed analysis on the complexity of our
algorithms and show that, while maintaining low state preparation cost, our
algorithms can completely eliminate the time dependence. This is a more than
exponential improvement compared to the previous state-of-the-art quantum
algorithms.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new platform, the junction-embedded resonator (JER), to study how energy is lost in Josephson junctions (JJs). By tuning the resonator, the researchers could isolate and measure two types of energy loss (internal and external) by changing the JJ's size and quantity. This work clarifies how these losses affect JJ performance and offers guidance for improving JJs for use in superconducting electronics.

Motivation: Accurately identifying the dissipation mechanisms and assessing their impact on Josephson junction (JJ) performance is critical for the effective application of JJs in superconducting circuits.

Method: The study uses a junction-embedded resonator (JER) constructed by embedding a Josephson junction (JJ) in the middle of an open-circuit, 1/2 lambda transmission-line resonator. The 1st and 2nd harmonics of the JER are excited to create different boundary conditions for the JJ, enabling the study of internal and external dissipation mechanisms. The JJ area and number were systematically varied to analyze these dissipation mechanisms.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the junction-embedded resonator (JER) as a platform for identifying and quantifying dissipation mechanisms in Josephson junctions (JJs). By exciting the 1st and 2nd harmonics of the JER, different boundary conditions are imposed on the JJ, allowing for the study of internal and external dissipation respectively. The research systematically varied JJ area and number to analyze these mechanisms, revealing distinct behaviors and quantitatively characterizing their contributions, which can guide JJ optimization for various applications.

Abstract: Pinpointing the dissipation mechanisms and evaluating their impacts to the

Conclusion: 本研究在理论上证明了非厄米微扰可以将点状狄拉克单极子转化为具有不同电荷构型的手征疏密波，并通过观察复几何相位证实了这些构型。

Abstract: We theoretically establish that non-Hermitian perturbations induce a
topological transformation of point-like Dirac monopoles into extended monopole
distributions, characterized by distinct charge configurations emergent from
three distinct Berry connection forms. Using piecewise adiabatic evolution, we
confirm the validity of these configurations through observations of complex
geometric phases. Most critically, we find a quantitative relation $\Delta
\phi_d = \Delta \phi_g$, which quantifies how cumulative minute energy
differences (\(\Delta \phi_d\)) manifest as geometric phase shifts (\(\Delta
\phi_g\)) uniquely in non-Hermitian systems. We further propose a scheme
leveraging soliton dynamics in dissipative two-component Bose-Einstein
condensates, enabling direct measurement of these topological signatures. These
results establish a milestone for understanding Dirac monopole charge
distributions and measuring complex geometric phases in non-Hermitian systems,
with far-reaching implications for topological quantum computing and

TL;DR: 量子密钥分发（QKD）虽然安全，但实际实现存在漏洞。本研究提出一种改进协议（SCS），通过编码和第三方测量来防御检测端和源端的攻击，同时只需对强度进行上界表征。结果表明，当反射光强度低于10^-6时，安全性大大提高，使该协议更实用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管量子密钥分发（QKD）提供了理论上无条件的安全保障，但实际实现仍易受非理想设备和QKD系统源端与检测端安全漏洞的影响。SCS协议旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: 通过在真空和非真空状态下编码比特，并引入第三方测量节点来解决安全挑战，同时保留了SCS协议的关键优势，即只需要对强度进行上界表征，而无需对无限维度的量子态进行完整描述。

Result: 当来自特洛伊木马攻击的反射光强度低于10^-6时，Eve几乎无法从反射中提取额外的密钥信息。

Conclusion: 该工作使SCS协议更具实用性。

Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) leverages the principles of quantum mechanics
to provide theoretically unconditional security for cryptographic key sharing.
However, practical implementations remain vulnerable due to non-ideal devices
and potential security loopholes at both the source and detection sides of QKD
systems. The side-channel-secure (SCS) protocol addresses these challenges by
encoding bits in vacuum and non-vacuum states and introducing a third-party
measurement node, thereby repelling attacks targeting the detection side as
well as external lab attacks on the source side. In this work, we consider the
state-dependent correlated errors and Trojan-horse attack while preserving the
SCS protocol's key advantage-specifically, requiring only upper bounds on
intensities characterization without needing a full description of quantum
states in infinite dimensions. Numerical results demonstrate that when the
reflected light intensity from Trojan-horse attacks falls below $10^{-6}$, Eve
can scarcely extract additional key information from the reflections. This work
makes the SCS protocol more practical.

Abstract: Deterministically tailoring optical Fock states beyond the single-photon
level is crucial for boson sampling, loss-tolerant photonic qubits, and
quantum-enhanced sensing, however has yet remained elusive. Here, we report an
all-linear-optical protocol that converts a resonantly driven single-photon
emitter into a deterministic generator of vacuum--single-photon--two-photon
states. A phase-stabilized, path-unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer
combines vacuum--single-photon interference and Hong-Ou-Mandel effect,
providing two knobs to shape photon-number probabilities. By tuning these
knobs, we observe a dynamic transition from antibunching to strong bunching in
correlation measurements. A fully quantum-mechanical, discrete time-bin model
maps these results onto the tailored photon statistics. The same framework
predicts that two indistinguishable emitters would extend the accessible space
to deterministic NOON states and single-photon filtering. This protocol relying
on linear optics and available single-photon sources provides a scalable,
chip-compatible, and platform-independent route to on-demand and deterministic
few-photon resources for quantum metrology, photonic computing, as well as
long-distance quantum networks.

Abstract: The rapid development of machine learning and quantum computing has placed
quantum machine learning at the forefront of research. However, existing
quantum machine learning algorithms based on quantum variational algorithms
face challenges in trainability and noise robustness. In order to address these
challenges, we introduce a gradient-free, noise-robust quantum reservoir
computing algorithm that harnesses discrete time crystal dynamics as a
reservoir. We first calibrate the memory, nonlinear, and information scrambling
capacities of the quantum reservoir, revealing their correlation with dynamical
phases and non-equilibrium phase transitions. We then apply the algorithm to
the binary classification task and establish a comparative quantum kernel
advantage. For ten-class classification, both noisy simulations and
experimental results on superconducting quantum processors match ideal
simulations, demonstrating the enhanced accuracy with increasing system size
and confirming the topological noise robustness. Our work presents the first
experimental demonstration of quantum reservoir computing for image
classification based on digital quantum simulation. It establishes the
correlation between quantum many-body non-equilibrium phase transitions and
quantum machine learning performance, providing new design principles for

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子测量诱导的长程纠缠（LRE）态的制备是有前途的策略，但其对现实的、非对易的测量噪声的稳定性仍然是一个关键的未解决问题。

Method: 本研究采用副本平均场理论（用于更高维度）和一维数值模拟相结合的方法，系统地研究了竞争性、非对易弱测量（最近邻伊辛和单量子比特横向算子）的最小模型所产生的丰富相结构，并推导了完整的有限时间和稳态相图。

Result: 研究揭示了相结构对读出方案的显著依赖性：完全读出产生短程纠缠（SRE）相和纯 LRE 相之间的直接相变；无读出（纯退相干）则表现出强到弱的自发对称性破缺 (SWSSB) 相变，进入经典有序混合态；部分读出则在这些极限之间进行插值，展现出混合状态相变，系统可能陷入 SWSSB 相，或者在较弱的非对易性下，经历连续的对称性破缺，最终达到混合 LRE 相。此外，该研究还引入了基于通道保真度的配分函数，能够同时表征纠缠和 SWSSB 序参量。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了对测量诱导相变、自发弱对称性破缺 (SWSSB) 和混合状态相变进行理解的统一图景，为在嘈杂量子设备上设计鲁棒的状态制备协议提供了关键见解。

Abstract: The preparation of long-range entangled (LRE) states via quantum measurements
is a promising strategy, yet its stability against realistic, non-commuting
measurement noise remains a critical open question. Here, we systematically
investigate the rich phase structure emerging from a minimal model of
competing, non-commuting weak measurements: nearest-neighbor Ising ($Z_iZ_j$)
and single-qubit transverse ($X_i$) operators. We analyze three experimentally
relevant scenarios based on which measurement outcomes are read out: complete
readout, no readout, and partial readout. Using a replica mean-field theory for
higher dimensions, complemented by numerical simulations in one dimension, we
derive the complete finite-time and stationary phase diagrams. Our analysis
reveals a striking dependence on the readout protocol. Complete readout yields
a direct transition between a short-range entangled (SRE) phase and a pure LRE
phase. No readout (pure decoherence) precludes entanglement but exhibits a
strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) transition into a
classically ordered mixed state. Most intriguingly, partial readout
interpolates between these limits, featuring a mixed-state phase transition
where the system can become trapped in the SWSSB phase or, for weaker
non-commutativity, undergo successive symmetry breaking to reach a mixed LRE
phase. A novel technical contribution is the use of a channel-fidelity-based
partition function that allows us to simultaneously characterize both
entanglement and SWSSB order, revealing a deep interplay between them in the
replica limit. These results provide a cohesive picture for understanding
measurement phase transitions, SWSSB, and mixed-state phase transitions,
offering crucial insights for designing robust state preparation protocols on
noisy quantum devices.

Motivation: Check the validity of the assumption that multipoles are traceless for a correct evaluation of dispersion forces at all distances.

Method: Revisit the concept of dispersion forces on an atom near a dielectric surface from the perspective of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics.

Result: The trace of the octupole moment contributes to Casimir-Polder interactions beyond the electrostatic regime.

Conclusion: Beyond the quadrupole, multipoles cannot always be taken as fully traceless. The trace of the octupole moment contributes to Casimir-Polder interactions beyond the electrostatic regime.

Abstract: Light-matter interaction models invariably rely on the multipole expansion of
the electromagnetic potentials generated by complex charge distributions. These
multipoles are typically taken to be traceless, however, for a correct
evaluation of dispersion forces at all distances, the validity of this
assumption has to be checked carefully. Here, we revisit the concept of
dispersion forces on an atom near a dielectric surface from the perspective of
macroscopic quantum electrodynamics and find that, beyond the quadrupole, the
multipoles cannot always be taken as fully traceless. In particular, we show
that the trace of the octupole moment contributes to Casimir-Polder
interactions beyond the electrostatic regime.

Abstract: We investigate quantum-enhanced parameter estimation in boundary time
crystals (BTCs) via continuous monitoring. By analytically deriving the global
quantum Fisher information rate, we show that in the time-crystal phase the
ultimate precision exhibits a cubic scaling with the system size,
$f_{\mathrm{global}}\sim N^3$, surpassing both the sensitivity at the critical
point and the standard quantum limit (SQL). We then numerically demonstrate
that this bound can be attained already at finite $N$ using experimentally
accessible strategies: continuous photodetection and, in particular, continuous
homodyne detection. Moving towards realistic implementations, we derive the
fundamental precision limits for inefficient detection ($\eta<1$). While
inefficiencies asymptotically restore SQL scaling, a constant-factor quantum
advantage remains possible, diverging as $\eta\!\to\!1$. Numerical simulations
show that homodyne detection outperforms photodetection in approaching the
ultimate bound and consistently provides a collective advantage over
independent single-qubit protocols, which grows with $N$.

Abstract: Quantum mechanics (QM) and General relativity (GR), also known as the theory
of gravity, are the two pillars of modern physics. A matter-wave interferometer
with a massive particle can test numerous fundamental ideas, including the
spatial superposition principle - a foundational concept in QM - in previously
unexplored regimes. It also opens the possibility of probing the interface
between QM and GR, such as testing the quantization of gravity. Consequently,
there exists an intensive effort to realize such an interferometer. While
several approaches are being explored, we focus on utilizing nanodiamonds with
embedded spins as test particles which, in combination with Stern-Gerlach
forces, enable the realization of a closed-loop matter-wave interferometer in
space-time. There is a growing community of groups pursuing this path [1]. We
are posting this technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes), to
highlight our plans and solutions concerning various challenges in this
ambitious endeavor, hoping this will support this growing community. Here we
present our work on quantum control of a nitrogen-vacancy spin system in bulk
diamonds and in levitated diamonds as a step towards Stern-Gerlach
interferometry with levitated nanodiamonds. Our simulations show that the
current state of the art for spin coherence time in nanodiamonds of a few tens
of microseconds, is good enough to enable an SGI spatial splitting on the order
of nanometers for an ND composed of 10^7 atoms. We would be happy to make

Conclusion: 该研究推导了适用于任意数量非对易守恒量的量子输运系统的涨落关系和热力学不确定性关系，即使在远离平衡态的输运过程中也是如此。这些关系普遍适用，且无需效率参数，将已知的热量交换涨落定理推广到了非阿贝尔量子输运的领域。

Abstract: We derive detailed and intergral fluctuation relations as well as a
Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation constraining the exchange statistics of an
arbitrary number of non-commuting conserved quantities among two quantum
systems in transport setups arbitrary far from equilibrium. These universal
relations, valid without the need of any efficacy parameter, extend the
well-known heat exchange fluctuation theorems for energy and particle transport
to the case of non-Abelian quantum transport, where the non-commutativity of
the charges allows bending standard thermodynamic rules. In particular, we show
that this can lead to apparent violations of the second law of thermodynamics,
it enhances precision in the current fluctuations, and it allows for the
inversion of all currents against their affinity biases.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Self-testing is a powerful device-independent technique that enables one to
deduce the forms of both the quantum state and the measurements involved in a
physical experiment based solely on observed correlations. Although numerous
schemes for self-testing multipartite entangled states have been proposed, they
are typically difficult to implement experimentally, as their complexity
increases significantly with the number of subsystems or the local dimension.
In this work, we introduce the first self-testing scheme of a relevant class of
multiqudit genuinely entangled states that exploits only a constant number of
binary measurements per observer, which significantly reduces the experimental
effort to implement the scheme. Specifically, it enables the self-testing of
multipartite Slater (or supersinglet) states composed of $d$ qu\textit{d}its
with odd $d$ using only four two-outcome measurements per observer. Moreover,
we prove that our scheme is robust to noise and experimental imperfections. For
systems of even local dimension $d$, we also provide an adapted version of the
scheme that requires only $d$ binary measurements per observer.

Abstract: In distributed quantum computing, the final solution of a problem is usually
achieved by catenating these partial solutions resulted from different
computing nodes, but intolerable errors likely yield in this catenation
process. In this paper, we propose a universal error correction scheme to
reduce errors and obtain effective solutions. Then, we apply this error
correction scheme to designing a distributed phase estimation algorithm that
presents a basic tool for studying distributed Shor's algorithm and distributed
discrete logarithm algorithm as well as other distributed quantum algorithms.
Our method may provide a universal strategy of error correction for a kind of
distributed quantum computing.

Abstract: Quantum mechanics (QM) and General relativity (GR), also known as the theory
of gravity, are the two pillars of modern physics. A matter-wave interferometer
with a massive particle, can test numerous fundamental ideas, including the
spatial superposition principle - a foundational concept in QM - in completely
new regimes, as well as the interface between QM and GR, e.g., testing the
quantization of gravity. Consequently, there exists an intensive effort to
realize such an interferometer. While several paths are being pursued, we focus
on utilizing nanodiamonds as our particle, and a spin embedded in the ND
together with Stern-Gerlach forces, to achieve a closed loop in space-time.
There is a growing community of groups pursuing this path [1]. We are posting
this technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes), to highlight our
plans and solutions concerning various challenges in this ambitious endeavor,
hoping this will support this growing community.
  In this work we demonstrate the neutralization of levitated nanodiamonds
using ultraviolet photoemission, and characterize the dependence of this
process on both the illumination wavelength and particle size. Furthermore, we
demonstrate discrete, single-electron charge manipulation of levitated
nanodiamond in a needle Paul trap at a pressure of 0.5\,Torr. Finally, we
demonstrate fast neutralization of levitated nanodiamonds, achieving a
neutralization rate much faster than the state of the art. As neutralization is
crucial to avoid spatial decoherence, this constitutes a significant step
towards the realization of a nanodiamond spatial interferometer. We would be
happy to make available more details upon request.

Abstract: Recent advances in chip scale magnetic quantum sensing have produced
platforms that pair unprecedented sensitivity with extreme miniaturization.
Here, we demonstrate a hybrid quantum sensor by combining Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV)
centers in diamond with a rubidium (Rb) vapor cell, designed for precise

leverages the high resolution vector magnetic sensing of NV centers along with
the high scalar field sensitivity of the Rb vapor, enhancing the estimation of
the magnetic field in terms of magnitude, direction and spatial distribution. A
micromachined mm scale vapor cell containing Rb atoms is paired with a bulk
diamond, enabling optical and microwave control of both quantum systems for
integrated field estimation. Simulations and experimental results confirm the
improved accuracy of the system in magnetic field measurements, demonstrating a
beyond 10 dB improvement. This NV and Rb platform offers a versatile route
toward portable, sensitive magnetometry and opens new possibilities for
integrated, multi-modal quantum sensing.

Abstract: The extent to which quantum computers can simulate physical phenomena and
solve the partial differential equations (PDEs) that govern them remains a
central open question. In this work, one of the most fundamental PDEs is
addressed: the multidimensional transport equation with space- and
time-dependent coefficients. We present a quantum numerical scheme based on
three steps: quantum state preparation, evolution, and measurement of relevant
observables. The evolution step combines a high-order centered finite
difference with a time-splitting scheme based on product formula
approximations, also known as Trotterization. Novel numerical analysis is
introduced to bound the different sources of error and we prove that, for the
product formula approximations, vector norm analysis guarantees similar
accuracy with exponentially fewer time steps than operator-norm-based
approaches, thereby significantly reducing the projected computational
resources. We also present efficient quantum circuits and numerical simulations
that confirm the predicted vector-norm scaling. We report results on real
quantum hardware for the one-dimensional convection equation, and solve a
non-linear ordinary differential equation via its associated Liouville
equation, a particular case of transport equations. This work provides a
practical framework for efficiently simulating transport phenomena on quantum
computers, with potential applications in plasma physics, molecular gas
dynamics and non-linear dynamical systems, including chaotic systems.

*Bivas Mallick,Saheli Mukherjee,Nirman Ganguly,A. S. Majumdar*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a more practical way to find useful quantum states (non-absolutely separable) that can be turned into entangled states, by looking at their 'moments' instead of analyzing them completely. It also shows these states are helpful for distinguishing quantum channels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this research stems from the significant and active area of entanglement generation through unitary gates in quantum information and computation. Specifically, it addresses the existence of absolutely separable states, from which entanglement cannot be created via non-local unitary action, and highlights the utility of non-absolutely separable states as a resource that can be converted into entangled states.

Method: This paper proposes an efficient method for detecting non-absolutely separable states by evaluating moments, which avoids the need for full state tomography. The effectiveness of this moment-based approach is also examined for detecting non-absolutely separating quantum channels and resource-preserving channels.

Result: The paper presents an efficient method for detecting non-absolutely separable states using moment evaluation, enhancing practical applicability by bypassing full state tomography. It also addresses related problems concerning states with positive partial transpose under non-local unitary actions and examines the effectiveness of the moment-based approach for detecting non-absolutely separating quantum channels. Finally, it demonstrates that every non-absolutely separable state can offer an advantage in quantum-channel discrimination.

Conclusion: In conclusion, this paper proposes an efficient method for detecting non-absolutely separable states by evaluating moments, which bypasses the need for full state tomography. It also addresses related problems concerning positive partial transpose states and resource-preserving quantum channels. The operational significance of non-absolutely separable states is demonstrated through their advantage in quantum-channel discrimination tasks.

Abstract: In quantum information and computation, generation of entanglement through
unitary gates remains a significant and active area of research. However, there
are states termed as absolutely separable, from which entanglement cannot be
created through any non-local unitary action. Thus, from a resource-theoretic
perspective, non-absolutely separable states are useful as they can be turned
into entangled states using some appropriate unitary gates. In this work, we
propose an efficient method to detect non-absolutely separable states. Our
approach relies on evaluating moments that can bypass the need for full state
tomography, thereby enhancing its practical applicability. We then present
several examples in support of our detection scheme. We also address a closely
related problem concerning states whose partial transpose remains positive
under any arbitrary non-local unitary action. Furthermore, we examine the
effectiveness of our moment-based approach in the detection of quantum channels
that are not absolutely separating, which entails the detection of resource
preserving channels. Finally, we demonstrate the operational significance of
non-absolutely separable states by proving that every such state can provide an
advantage in a quantum-channel discrimination task.

Conclusion: 该框架为探索凝聚态系统中的时间量子效应提供了可行途径，并为实验实现开辟了可行路径。

Abstract: We propose a novel witness of temporal quantum entanglement using the
imaginary component of the complex heat capacity - a measurable thermodynamic
quantity in temperature-modulated calorimetry. By establishing a direct
correspondence between complex heat capacity and the pseudo-density matrix
formalism, our approach enables the characterisation of both spatial and
temporal quantum correlations without demanding additional state-level
manipulation beyond initial tomography. We analytically demonstrate this
connection for an open quantum system modelled by a qubit coupled to a thermal
bath, and show how both pseudo-density matrix negativity and violations of a
temporal CHSH inequality emerge as indicators of non-classical temporal
correlations. We further identify bounds on the imaginary heat capacity that
guarantee temporal entanglement, providing an experimentally accessible
criterion at the macroscopic scale. This framework offers a feasible route for
probing temporal quantum effects in condensed-matter systems and opens a viable
path toward experimental realisation.

Result: VibeLSD 解码器在各种错误提取方案、噪声模型和错误率下，其性能优于现有的所有实用量子色码解码器。此外，通过量子内存模拟估计的量子比特占用情况表明，量子色码的开销可与表面码相当，甚至更低。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，二维量子色码在实际应用中通过引入 VibeLSD 解码器，在性能上可与表面码相媲美，甚至在某些方面更优，并且在硬件实现方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Two-dimensional quantum colour codes hold significant promise for quantum
error correction, offering advantages such as planar connectivity and low
overhead logical gates. Despite their theoretical appeal, the practical
deployment of these codes faces challenges due to complex decoding requirements
compared to surface codes. This paper introduces vibe decoding which, for the
first time, brings colour code performance on par with the surface code under
practical decoding. Our approach leverages an ensemble of belief propagation
decoders - each executing a distinct serial message passing schedule - combined
with localised statistics post-processing. We refer to this combined protocol
as VibeLSD. The VibeLSD decoder is highly versatile: our numerical results show
it outperforms all practical existing colour code decoders across various
syndrome extraction schemes, noise models, and error rates. By estimating qubit
footprints through quantum memory simulations, we show that colour codes can
operate with overhead that is comparable to, and in some cases lower than, that
of the surface code. This, combined with the fact that localised statistics
decoding is a parallel algorithm, makes VibeLSD suitable for implementation on
specialised hardware for real-time decoding. Our results establish the colour
code as a practical architecture for near-term quantum hardware, providing
improved compilation efficiency for both Clifford and non-Clifford gates
without incurring additional qubit overhead relative to the surface code.

Conclusion: 需要谨慎外推经典模拟量子动力学的准确性。我们的结果表明，经典和量子模拟之间的良性竞争有助于从两个方向获得见解。

Abstract: As simulations of quantum systems cross the limits of classical
computability, both quantum and classical approaches become hard to verify.
Scaling predictions are therefore based on local structure and asymptotic
assumptions, typically with classical methods being used to evaluate quantum
simulators where possible. Here, in contrast, we use a quantum annealing
processor to produce a ground truth for evaluating classical tensor-network
methods whose scaling has not yet been firmly established. Our observations run
contrary to previous scaling predictions, demonstrating the need for caution
when extrapolating the accuracy of classical simulations of quantum dynamics.
Our results demonstrate that the virtuous cycle of competition between
classical and quantum simulations can lend insight in both directions.

  We demonstrate that many common SVM kernels correspond naturally to Green's

satisfy Mercer's theorem, and therefore the corresponding Green's function may
also fail to perform optimally.
  We further introduce a Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM) for designing
customized kernels that align with Green's functions.
  Our numerical experiments confirm that employing positive-semidefinite
kernels that correspond to Green's functions significantly improves predictive

TL;DR: 本研究通过构建不同的MBST结构，发现MBST体系中的磁行为不能仅用直接交换或超交换相互作用来解释，并提出可能与拓扑相关的机制有关。此研究为理解MBST的磁性提供了新视角。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究本征磁性拓扑绝缘体Mn(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4（MBST）体系中磁相互作用的性质，以期为下一代自旋电子和电子器件的开发提供新的视角。

Method: 通过构建MBST(1 SL)/(Bi1-xSbx)2Te3异质结构和MBST(1 SL)/(Bi1-xSbx)2Te3/MBST(1 SL)夹层结构，研究了磁相互作用的性质。

Result: 夹层结构的平面外磁化强度显著大于异质结构，表明两层MBST之间的层间磁相互作用是铁磁性的。居里温度随MBST层内Mn-Mn距离减小而增加，表明层内铁磁相互作用增强。夹层结构中的居里温度高于无间隔层的结构。此外，载流子密度调制对夹层结构的异常霍尔效应曲线形状影响很小，表明该体系中的铁磁性与载流子无关。

Conclusion: 基于上述结果，直接交换或超交换相互作用无法完全解释我们体系中的磁行为，提出磁行为源于与拓扑相关的机制，如范德华和Bloembergen-Rowland机制。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the nature of magnetic interactions in intrinsic
magnetic topological insulator Mn(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4 (MBST in short) systems, which
possesses highly-ordered ferromagnetic septuple-layers (SLs), using two types
of structures: MBST(1 SL)/(Bi1-xSbx)2Te3 heterostructures and MBST(1
SL)/(Bi1-xSbx)2Te3/MBST(1 SL) sandwich structures. The out-of-plane
magnetization in the sandwich structure turned out to be significantly larger
than that in the heterostructure, indicating that the interlayer magnetic
interaction between two MBST layers is ferromagnetic. Furthermore, the Curie
temperature increased with decreasing the in-plane Mn-Mn distance in the MBST
layer, which suggests the enhancement of the intralayer ferromagnetic
interaction within each MBST layer. Meanwhile, in the sandwich structures with
various spacer thicknesses, the Curie temperature with the spacer layer was
higher than that with no spacer layer. In addition, the curve shape of
anomalous Hall effects for the sandwich structure was almost unchanged by
carrier-density modulation, which implies that the ferromagnetism in this
system is carrier-independent. Based on the above results, magnetic behaviors
in our systems cannot be explained only by the direct exchange nor
superexchange interactions reported previously for MBST systems, and are
instead proposed to arise from topology-related mechanisms such as the van
Vleck and Bloembergen-Rowland mechanisms. This work provides a new perspective
on magnetic mechanisms in MBST systems, which helps us to realize
next-generation spintronic and electronic devices by flexibly controlling
magnetism in intrinsic magnetic topological insulators.

TL;DR: RuO$_{2}$薄膜在与铁磁层接触时，可能因为界面效应而非本征磁性表现出反铁磁性特征，其缺乏内在磁振子模式支持了这一观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨RuO$_{2}$是否具有本征磁序，以及近期研究对其磁性 ordering的质疑，特别是在薄膜异质结构中界面效应可能与反铁磁性/交替磁性信号相混淆的问题。

Method: 对RuO$_{2}$/NiFe和RuO$_{2}$/Fe两种独立生长的薄膜异质结构进行了广泛的磁测量，并结合了磁拉曼光谱测量和密度泛函理论（DFT）计算。

Result: 在低温（约15 K以下）时，两种样品均表现出交换偏置场；在约31 K时观察到自旋相变特征。磁拉曼测量显示，只有当存在NiFe层时，RuO$_{2}$薄膜才显示出磁振子模式，表明RuO$_{2}$本身可能不具有长程磁序。

Conclusion: RuO$_{2}$薄膜在与铁磁层（NiFe或Fe）接触时表现出可能归因于反铁磁性的现象，但缺乏本征的磁振子模式，暗示可能存在层间扩散或界面处的自旋无序（如DFT计算所示）。

Abstract: RuO$_{2}$ has been proposed as the prototypical altermagnetic material.
However, several reports have recently questioned its intrinsic magnetic
ordering, leading to conflicting findings, especially in thin film
heterostructures pointing to possible interface effects being convoluted with
supposed antiferromagnetic/altermagnetic signatures. Here, extensive
magnetometry measurements were performed on two independently grown thin film
heterostructures of RuO$_{2}$ interfaced with either NiFe or Fe acting as the
ferromagnetic layer. Below about 15 K, both samples exhibit exchange bias
fields when cooled to approximately 2 K in a $+$1 T field, and a spin
transitional feature is observed around 31 K. Magneto-Raman measurements on
RuO$_{2}$ thin films only reveal a magnon mode when there is a NiFe layer,
suggesting that RuO$_{2}$ does not intrinsically possess long range magnetic
ordering.. When in contact with a ferromagnet, RuO$_2$ displays effects that
could be ascribed to antiferromagnetism. However, the lack of intrinsic magnon
modes points toward possible diffusion between the layers or spin disorder at
the interface as seen by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Abstract: The heat capacity of solids at intermediate-to-high temperatures is of
fundamental importance to several fields ranging from geology to material
science. It depends on a variety of factors, with anharmonicity and,
ultimately, melting playing a pivotal role. In this work we develop a
first-principles model from an analytically tractable semi-harmonic oscillator
Hamiltonian. The resulting specific heat expression depends not only on the
Einstein temperature of the material but also on other physical parameters. We
compare our predictions with experimental data for copper, aluminum, lead,
silicon, and germanium with rather satisfactory results, especially considering
that there are no fitting parameters in our theory. We finish this work by
showing that our results formally justify the otherwise purely empirical
formula by Maier and Kelley, also providing its coefficients in terms of
elementary physical quantities.

Abstract: Machine learning surrogates of Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory
Hamiltonians offer a powerful tool to accelerate the prediction of electronic
properties of materials, such as electronic band structures and
densities-of-states. For large-scale applications, an ideal model would exhibit
high generalization ability and computational efficiency. Here, we introduce
the MACE-H graph neural network, which combines high body-order message passing
with a node-order expansion to efficiently obtain all relevant $O(3)$
irreducible representations. The model achieves high accuracy and computational
efficiency and captures the full local chemical environment features of,
currently, up to $f$ orbital matrix interaction blocks. We demonstrate the
model's accuracy and transferability on several open materials benchmark
datasets of two-dimensional materials and a new dataset for bulk gold,
achieving sub-meV prediction errors on matrix elements and eigenvalues across
all systems. We further analyse the interplay of high body order message
passing and locality that makes this model a good candidate for high-throughput
material screening.

Abstract: This work explores erbium-doped calcium molybdate (CaMoO$_4$) thin films
grown on silicon and yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) substrates, as a
potential solid state system for C-band (utilizing the $\sim$1.5 $\mu$m
Er$^{3+}$ 4f-4f transition) quantum emitters for quantum network applications.
Through molecular beam epitaxial growth experiments and electron microscopy,
X-ray diffraction and reflection electron diffraction studies, we identify an
incorporation limited deposition regime that enables a 1:1 Ca:Mo ratio in the
growing film leading to single phase CaMoO$_4$ formation that can be in-situ
doped with Er (typically 2-100 ppm). We further show that growth on silicon
substrates is single phase but polycrystalline in morphology; while growth on
YSZ substrates leads to high-quality epitaxial single crystalline CaMoO$_4$
films. We perform preliminary optical and microwave characterization on the
suspected $Y_1 - Z_1$ transition of 2 ppm, 200 nm epitaxial CaMoO$_4$ annealed
thin films and extract an optical inhomogeneous linewidth of 9.1(1) GHz, an
optical excited state lifetime of 6.7(2) ms, a spectral diffusion-limited

Method: 利用基于深度学习间相互作用势（DP）模型的分子动力学（MD）模拟，准确预测了2D NbOCl2复杂的构型空间、极化转换动力学和有限温度热力学性质。

Result: 在剪切应变下，NbOCl2单层表现出本征反铁电性，具有室温稳定性、低极化转换势垒和一维共线极化排列。电场可以触发从AFE到FE相的转变，产生具有小迟滞的双极化-电（P-E）回线。

Abstract: Compared to the well studied two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectricity, much rare
is the appearance of 2D antiferroelectricity, where local dipoles from the
nonequivalent sublattices within 2D monolayers are oppositely orientated. Using
NbOCl2 monolayer with competing ferroelectric (FE) and antiferroelectric (AFE)
phases as a 2D material platform, we demonstrate the emerging of intrinsic
antiferroelectricity in NbOCl2 monolayer under the experimentally accessible
shear strain, and new functionality associated with electric field induced
AFE-to-FE phase transition. Specifically, the complex configuration space
accommodating FE and AFE phases, polarization switching kinetics and finite
temperature thermodynamic properties of 2D NbOCl2, are all accurately predicted
by large-scale molecular dynamic (MD) simulations based on deep learning
interatomic potential (DP) model. Moreover, room temperature stable
antiferroelectricity with low polarization switching barrier and
one-dimensional (1D) collinear polarization arrangement is predicted in shear
deformed NbOCl2 monolayer. Transition from AFE to FE phase in 2D NbOCl2 can be
triggered by the low critical electric field, leading to the double
polarization-electric (P-E) loop with small hysteresis. A new type
optoelectronic device composed of AFE-NbOCl2, enabling electric "writing" and
nonlinear optical "reading" logical operation with fast operation speed and low
power consumption is also proposed.

Abstract: Layered transition metal oxides typified by the Ruddlesden-Popper phase have
been extensively studied for its applications in high-temperature
superconductivity, catalysis, and battery technologies. Despite the remarkable
structural diversity and catalytic functionality of platinum oxides, the
exploration of layered polymorphs has remained significantly constrained mainly
due to the high inertness of platinum. Here, we discover a new homologous
series of layered ternary oxides, Na(PtO$_2$)$_{2\it{n}+1}$, by a combination
of highly oxidizing high-pressure methods and density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. This series features unprecedented layered structural motifs,
rutile-based PtO$_6$ octahedra and one-dimensional PtO$_4$ square-planar
columns, which enables systematic control of dimensionality. Furthermore, we
demonstrate a computationally-assisted identification of isomeric and putative
members of this homologous series as confirmed by controlled synthesis and
quantitative analysis of diffuse scattering data. This approach provides an
effective platform for the exhaustive exploration of metastable transition
metal oxides with rich structural variations.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一个用于模拟氢同位素在具有多重占据陷阱材料中扩散和滞留的计算模型。该模型简化了方程，揭示了浓度依赖性，区分了不同陷阱类型的影响，并通过实验验证了其准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了更好地理解和模拟氢同位素在材料中的扩散和滞留行为，特别是考虑到多重占据陷阱和多种同位素的存在，需要一个能够准确描述这些复杂现象的计算模型。

Method: 提出一个计算方案，使用第一性原理计算对具有多重占据陷阱的多种氢同位素（HI）的扩散和滞留进行参数化。采用动态稳态（Oriani平衡的推广）来简化耦合微分方程。通过模拟HI与钒中的单空位结合以及多重单一占据陷阱与多重占据陷阱的对比，来分析扩散行为。最后，通过与钨中的同位素交换实验进行比较，并利用分子动力学估算空位分布，来评估模型的适用性。

Result: 研究表明，动态稳态是简化气体演化方程的有效方法。总气体浓度接近陷阱密度时，有效气体扩散系数变化最大。HI与钒中单空位结合导致扩散系数与气体浓度呈非单调关系，不同于钨系统。模型能够区分多重单一占据陷阱与多重占据陷阱在长期扩散动力学上的差异。模型在稳态下的适用性通过与钨中的同位素交换实验对比得到验证，且在没有拟合参数的情况下，保留情况与实验结果吻合良好。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一个计算方案，用于模拟具有多重占据陷阱的多种氢同位素（HI）的扩散和滞留，该方案利用第一性原理计算进行参数化。研究表明，通过采用动态稳态（这是Oriani平衡在多种同位素和多重占据陷阱下的推广），可以简化气体演化的耦合微分方程。当总气体浓度接近陷阱密度时，有效气体扩散系数随迁移率变化最大。研究还发现，HI与钒中的单空位结合会导致扩散系数与气体浓度之间存在非单调关系，这与钨系统不同。研究证明了多重单一占据陷阱与多重占据陷阱在长期扩散动力学上的区别。最后，通过将模型与氢和氘在自离子辐照钨中的同位素交换实验进行比较，评估了多重占据、多同位素模型在稳态下的适用性。利用分子动力学估算空位分布，并将保留情况与实验进行比较，结果在没有拟合参数的情况下表现出良好的一致性。

Abstract: We propose a computational scheme for the diffusion and retention of multiple
hydrogen isotopes (HI) with multi-occupancy traps parameterized by first
principles calculations. We show that it is often acceptable to reduce the
complexity of the coupled differential equations for gas evolution by taking
the dynamic steady state, a generalisation of the Oriani equilibrium for
multiple isotopes and multi-occupancy traps. The effective gas diffusivity
varies most with mobile fraction when the total gas concentration approximates
the trap density. We show HI binding to a monovacancy in vanadium produces a
non-monotonic dependence between diffusivity and gas concentration, unlike the
tungsten system. We demonstrate the difference between multiple single
occupancy traps and multi-occupancy traps in long-term diffusion dynamics. The
applicability of the multi-occupancy, multi-isotope model in steady state is
assessed by comparison to an isotope exchange experiment between hydrogen and
deuterium in self-ion irradiated tungsten. The vacancy distribution is
estimated with molecular dynamics, and the retention across sample depth shows
good agreement with experiment using no fitting parameters.

Abstract: Durable, high-performance and eco-friendly lead-free piezoceramics are
essential for next-generation sustainable energy transducers and
electromechanical systems. While significant performance enhancements have been
made, through chemical composition, texture, or crystal defects, piezoceramics
are intrinsically weak mechanically, which negatively impact their working
conditions and durability. What's more, improving comprehensive mechanical
durability without sacrificing piezoelectric performance remains a key
challenge. Here, we design bioinspired Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 (BNT) ceramics using a
scalable colloidal process that enables multiscale control over the
microstructure. The design comprises plate-like monocrystalline BNT bricks
stacked to induce a crystallographic texture along the poling direction, bonded
together by a silica-based mortar, forming the brick-and-mortar phase. This
deliberate microstructure design yields 2- to 3-fold increase in flexural
strength, and 1.6- to 2-fold increase in fracture toughness compared with a BNT
synthesized conventionally, comparable to common structural ceramics, without
sacrificing the piezoelectric performance. In addition, the bioinspired BNT
exhibit dramatically enhanced ferroelectric fatigue resistance, with a 40- to
600-folds improvement in the number of field-induced electromechanical cycles
before failure. These gains stem from residual stress fields generated at the
interface between silica pockets and BNT bricks, which delay crack initiation.
Furthermore, we demonstrated enhanced transducing capability and
electromechanical fatigue resistance using a cantilever beam-based
piezoelectric transducer under bending mode. Given its
non-chemical-compositional origin, this bioinspired strategy could be broadly
applicable to other piezoelectric material systems for applications where both
functional and structural performance are critical.

Motivation: 理解并减缓钙钛矿中剩余的载流子损失对于提高其功率转换效率至关重要，特别是要弄清楚第二阶非辐射重组的起源和影响。

Method: 通过控制体相和表面条件来操纵载流子动力学，并结合依赖温度的光谱学，揭示了k2non值受外在因素影响，这与基于范鲁斯布鲁克-肖克利关系的内在二阶重组一致。基于密度泛函理论模拟和准费米能级计算，提出浅表面态是二阶非辐射成分的主要来源。

Result: k2non值受外在因素影响，与内在二阶重组不同。浅表面态是二阶非辐射成分的主要来源，在室温下可导致高达约80毫伏的总体开路电压（Voc）降低。

Conclusion: 载流子损失分为一阶和二阶，它们之间没有关联，需要分别制定缓解策略以实现钙钛太阳能电池的全部效率潜力。

Abstract: Halide perovskite solar cells have demonstrated a rapid increase in power
conversion efficiencies. Understanding and mitigating remaining carrier losses
in halide perovskites is now crucial to enable further increases to approach
their practical efficiency limits. Whilst the most widely known non-radiative
recombination from solar cells relates to carrier trapping and is first order
in carrier density, recent reports have revealed a non-radiative pathway that
is second order. However, the origin and impact of this second-order process on
devices remain unclear. Here, we understand this non-radiative second-order
recombination (k2non) pathway by manipulating the charge carrier dynamics via
controlling the bulk and surface conditions. By combining temperature-dependent
spectroscopies, we demonstrate that the value of k2non depends on extrinsic
factors, in contrast to intrinsic second-order recombination, which aligns with
theoretical evaluations through van Roosbroeck-Shockley relations. Based on
density functional theory simulations and Quasi-Fermi level calculations, we
propose that shallow surface states are the primary origin of this second-order
non-radiative component, contributing up to ~80 mV of the overall reduction in
Voc at room temperature. This work reveals that carrier losses from two
non-radiative recombination types (first and second order) are not linked,
emphasizing the need for distinctive mitigation strategies targeting each type
to unlock the full efficiency potential of perovskite solar cells.

Motivation: The need for physically interpretable machine learning models in materials science, despite the emergence of ML methods for constructing structure-property relationships based on multimodal characterization.

Method: Utilizing attention-based neural networks, specifically the Transformer model, to analyze attention scores and disentangle the influence of distinct domain patterns on polarization switching in PbTiO3 thin films. The model was explored both as a direct interpretability tool and as a surrogate for explaining representations learned via unsupervised machine learning.

Conclusion: Attention-based neural networks show potential for revealing structure-property relationships and underlying physical mechanisms in materials science, offering high efficiency in highlighting meaningful structural features compared to SHAP analysis.

Abstract: Machine learning methods are emerging as a universal paradigm for
constructing correlative structure-property relationships in materials science
based on multimodal characterization. However, this necessitates development of
methods for physical interpretability of the resulting correlative models.
Here, we demonstrate the potential of attention-based neural networks for
revealing structure-property relationships and the underlying physical
mechanisms, using the ferroelectric properties of PbTiO3 thin films as a case
study. Through the analysis of attention scores, we disentangle the influence
of distinct domain patterns on the polarization switching process. The
attention-based Transformer model is explored both as a direct interpretability
tool and as a surrogate for explaining representations learned via unsupervised
machine learning, enabling the identification of physically grounded
correlations. We compare attention-derived interpretability scores with
classical SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis and show that, in
contrast to applications in natural language processing, attention mechanisms
in materials science exhibit high efficiency in highlighting meaningful
structural features.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_l$) in strongly
anharmonic materials requires renormalized interatomic force constants (IFCs)
and appropriate incorporation of diagonal and off-diagonal contributions and
higher-order scattering. We investigate CuCl, a highly anharmonic system with a
simple zincblende structure and ultralow $\kappa_l$. Our calculations,
including IFC renormalization and four-phonon scattering, show excellent
agreement with the experiment, underscoring the critical role of both effects
in the accurate estimation of $\kappa_l$. Furthermore, the unusual pressure
dependence of $\kappa_l$ is explored using a rigorously validated
machine-learned force field, with the predicted values showing good agreement
with the experimentally observed trend of monotonic decrease. This behavior is
primarily driven by a significant increase in four-phonon scattering and a
reduction in the group velocity of transverse acoustic modes. Overall, this
study establishes a robust framework for modeling thermal transport in strongly
anharmonic materials.

Motivation: 为了优化量子反常霍尔效应（QAHE），需要研究具有结构兼容性的MnBi2Te4 (MBT)/Bi2Te4 (BT)异质结构的磁状态。

Result: 研究发现了结构缺陷会产生小的铁磁分量（低于自旋翻转场），证实了反铁磁耦合Mn反位点的存在，并显示出它们会在主Bi层内诱导产生反平行磁矩。此外，检测到诱导产生的Bi磁矩，这为理解MBT/BT系统中的磁相互作用提供了重要的新信息。

Conclusion: 研究发现了MnBi2Te4(Bi2Te4)n异质结构中存在反铁磁耦合的Mn反位点，并证明了它们会在主Bi层内诱导产生反平行磁矩，这为理解MBT/BT系统中的磁相互作用提供了新的视角，并对工程化量子反常霍尔效应器件具有潜在的重要意义。

Abstract: MnBi2Te4 (MBT) is the first intrinsic magnetic topological insulator,
combining a topologically protected surface metallic state and intrinsic
magnetic order. A structural compatibility with the nonmagnetic Bi2Te4 (BT)
parent compound gives a possibility to create MBT/BT heterostructures and
manipulate their magnetic state in view of optimizing the Quantum Anomalous
Hall Effect (QAHE). In this work an extensive NMR study, supported by the bulk
magnetization measurements has been performed at 4.2 K on a self-organized
single crystal MnBi2Te4(Bi2Te4)n heterostructure. 55Mn and 209Bi NMR signal
have been recorded as a function of the out-of-plane magnetic field up to 6T,
covering a spin-flop transition from the antiferromagnetic (AFM) to the canted
antiferromagnetic (CAFM) configuration of the Mn layers. Structural defects
were shown to contribute a small ferromagnetic component below the spin-flop
field. Presence of the AFM-coupled Mn antisites has been evidenced and shown to
induce an antiparallel magnetic moment on Bi atoms within the host Bi layer.
Detection of the induced magnetic moment on bismuth which contributes a new
ferromagnetic component is of utmost importance for understanding the magnetic
interactions in the MBT/BT system. These findings have potentially important
implications for engineering the QAH devices.

energy shows a moderate decrease from 300K to about 1200 K, followed by a
stronger drop. We demonstrate the necessity to carefully consider the
individual thermal excitations. We also propose a way to analyze the origin of
the significant anharmonic contribution to the CSF energy through atomic pair
distributions at the CSF plane. With the newly available high-temperature CSF
data, an increasing energy barrier for the cross-slip process in Ni3Al with
increasing temperature is unveiled, necessitating the refinement of existing
analytical models.

TL;DR: 本研究使用半干法转移技术，通过表征转移前后的石墨烯和铜衬底，追溯了裂纹、褶皱、孔洞和撕裂等石墨烯缺陷的起源，为优化石墨烯生长和转移过程提供了指导。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对化学气相沉积（CVD）生长的石墨烯进行转移后的深入形貌表征，对于评估质量和理解转移薄片缺陷的起源至关重要。

Method: 采用半干法转移技术，将毫米级CVD石墨烯薄片从多晶铜箔上剥离并转移到SiO2/Si衬底上。结合多种形貌表征技术，追溯并阐明了各种转移后石墨烯缺陷（裂纹、褶皱、孔洞、撕裂）的起源。

Result: 研究表明，热诱导的褶皱会演变成纳米级裂纹，而铜表面台阶会导致折叠。此外，铜箔的宏观形貌在缺陷形成中也起着关键作用。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了如何正确解释石墨烯在相关衬底上的转移后形貌以及如何正确评估其质量的指南，有助于优化石墨烯CVD生长和转移过程以实现未来应用。

Abstract: Post-transfer in-depth morphological characterization of graphene grown by
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is of great importance to evaluate the quality
and to understand the origin of defects of the transferred sheets. Herein, a
semi-dry transfer technique is used to peel off millimeter-sized CVD graphene
flakes from polycrystalline copper foils and transfer them onto SiO2/Si
substrates. We take advantage of the unique feature of this semi-dry process:
it preserves the copper substrate, enabling location-specific morphological
comparisons between graphene and copper at various stages of the transfer.
Thanks to a combination of morphological characterization techniques, this
leads to trace and elucidate the origin of various post-transfer graphene
defects (cracks, wrinkles, holes, tears). Specifically, thermally induced
wrinkles are shown to evolve into nanoscale cracks, while copper surface steps
lead to folds. Furthermore, we find that the macroscale topography of the
copper foil also plays a critical role in defect formation. This work provides
guidelines on how to correctly interpret the post-transfer morphology of
graphene films on relevant substrates and how to properly assess their quality.
This contributes to the optimization of both the graphene CVD growth and
transfer processes for future applications.

TL;DR: 本研究调查了 Co、Mn 和 Zn 在 HfTiZrNbTa 和 HfTiZrNbV RHEAs 中的扩散行为。研究发现 Co 扩散主要通过间隙机制进行，扩散速度较快。研究结果强调了合金的局部原子环境与其扩散动力学之间的关系，这对于设计具有更好高温性能的合金至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于难熔高熵合金（RHEAs）在极端高温应用（如下一代涡轮机和核反应堆）中的潜力，原子扩散在控制蠕变抗性和微观结构稳定性等关键性能方面起着至关重要的作用。因此，本研究旨在系统地研究杂质扩散在这些合金中的行为。

Method: 本研究系统地运用放射性示踪技术研究了 Co、Mn 和 Zn 在单相 (BCC 固溶体) HfTiZrNbTa 和 HfTiZrNbV RHEAs 中的杂质扩散。此外，还采用了中子总散射技术评估了这些合金的配分函数和特定元素的晶格畸变。从头算起（Ab initio）的计算则用于确定所研究杂质的晶格畸变和溶解度，并考虑了短程有序的影响。

Result: 研究发现 Co 扩散主要受间隙机制控制，表现出快速扩散的特性。通过结合实验测量和理论计算，揭示了局部原子环境（如晶格畸变和短程有序）对 RHEAs 中扩散动力学的影响。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了钴、锰和锌在 HfTiZrNbTa 和 HfTiZrNbV RHEAs 中的扩散行为，并强调了局部原子环境和扩散动力学之间的结构-性能关系，为通过精确控制杂质扩散过程来设计具有增强的高温性能的合金提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) have emerged as promising candidates
for extreme high-temperature applications, for example, in next-generation
turbines and nuclear reactors. In such applications, atomic diffusion
critically governs essential properties including creep resistance and
microstructural stability. The present study systematically investigates
impurity diffusion of Co, Mn, and Zn in single phase (BCC solid solution)
HfTiZrNbTa and HfTiZrNbV RHEAs applying the radiotracer technique. A neutron
total scattering technique is used to evaluate the pair distribution functions
and element-specific lattice distortions in these alloys. \textit{Ab
initio}-based calculations give access to lattice distortions and solubilities
of the impurities under investigation, including the impact of short-range
order. The diffusion results are discussed in relation to calculated
substitutional and interstitial solution energies, local lattice distortions,
and short-range order effects. Co diffusion is found to be dominated by the
interstitial mechanism, exhibiting fast diffusion. These findings reveal
important structure-property relationships between local atomic environments
and diffusion kinetics in BCC RHEAs, providing critical insights for designing
alloys with enhanced high-temperature performance through targeted control of
impurity diffusion processes.

Result: 该方法应用于Nb掺杂的TiO2(110)表面，使用CO吸附作为探针，发现在表面原子层上，Nb掺杂对反应性的影响很小，而氧空位的影响显著，具体取决于它们在表面的局部排列，通过稳定极化子来影响反应性。

Conclusion: Nb掺杂对表面反应性影响很小，而氧空位通过稳定表面原子层上的极化子对其有显著影响。

Abstract: Polarons are widespread in functional materials and are key to device
performance in several technological applications. However, their effective
impact on material behavior remains elusive, as condensed matter studies
struggle to capture their intricate interplay with atomic defects in the
crystal. In this work, we present an automated workflow for modeling polarons
within density functional theory (DFT). Our approach enables a fully automatic
identification of the most favorable polaronic configurations in the system.
Machine learning techniques accelerate predictions, allowing for an efficient
exploration of the defect-polaron configuration space. We apply this
methodology to Nb-doped TiO$_2$(110) surfaces, providing new insights into the
role of defects in surface reactivity. Using CO adsorbates as a probe, we find
that Nb doping has minimal impact on reactivity, whereas oxygen vacancies
contribute significantly depending on their local arrangement via the
stabilization of polarons on the surface atomic layer. Our package streamlines
the modeling of charge trapping and polaron localization with high efficiency,
enabling systematic, large-scale investigations of polaronic effects across
complex material systems.

Motivation: 为了理解分子材料的聚合、解聚和其他加工步骤，有必要对凝聚相中的热活化化学进行分子建模。然而，目前的方法通常依赖于在特定反应物原子之间设定捕获距离等几何标准来选择可能的反应，这可能导致显著的分子应变和不切实际的结构。

Conclusion: 通过开发能够从反应前局部分子环境预测环化反应应变能的图神经网络，我们可以调整浓缩体系中相对反应速率并促进对复杂材料中热活化化学过程的理解。

Abstract: Molecular modeling of thermally activated chemistry in condensed phases is
essential to understand polymerization, depolymerization, and other processing
steps of molecular materials. Current methods typically combine molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations to describe short-time relaxation with a stochastic
description of predetermined chemical reactions. Possible reactions are often
selected on the basis of geometric criteria, such as a capture distance between
reactive atoms. Although these simulations have provided valuable insight, the
approximations used to determine possible reactions often lead to significant
molecular strain and unrealistic structures. We show that the local molecular
environment surrounding the reactive site plays a crucial role in determining
the resulting molecular strain energy and, in turn, the associated reaction
rates. We develop a graph neural network capable of predicting the strain
energy associated with a cyclization reaction from the pre-reaction, local,
molecular environment surrounding the reactive site. The model is trained on a
large dataset of condensed-phase reactions during the activation of
polyacrylonitrile (PAN) obtained from MD simulations and can be used to adjust
relative reaction rates in condensed systems and advance our understanding of
thermally activated chemical processes in complex materials

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种通过改变Al含量设计新型Co-Ni-Mo-Al合金的方法，利用Mo替代Al来优化L12沉淀物的形成，从而显著提高合金的强度和延展性。通过电子显微镜和DFT计算，发现Mo的加入促进了多种位错变形模式，克服了传统合金设计的局限性，为开发高性能M/HEAs提供了新途径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管L12沉淀物能显著提高单相面心立方（FCC）中/高熵合金（M/HEAs）的强度和延展性，但合金设计一直局限于特定的CrCoNi或FeCoCrNi基FCC基体和Ni3Al L12相成分，导致机械性能的进一步提升潜力尚未充分挖掘。本研究旨在通过引入新型Co-Ni-Mo-Al合金并系统性地改变Al含量，探索具有L12沉淀物的新合金体系，以揭示其强化机制，从而拓展M/HEAs的设计范围。

Method: 本研究采用透射电子显微镜进行位错分析，并结合密度泛函理论（DFT）计算广义堆垛层错能量（GSFE），以揭示钼替代铝对L12相中位错行为的影响，进而阐明其强化机制。

Result: (CoNi)81Mo12Al7合金实现了1086 MPa的屈服强度、1520 MPa的拉伸强度和35%的延伸率，展现了强度、延展性和应变硬化能力的优异协同作用。位错分析和DFT计算表明，Mo替代Al改变了L12相的位错行为，促进了多种变形模式的形成，如堆垛层错、超位错对、Lomer-Cottrell锁和异常纳米孪晶。

Conclusion: 本研究通过系统性地改变铝含量，引入了具有L12沉淀的新型Co-Ni-Mo-Al合金，旨在揭示强化机制，以弥合研究差距。研究结果表明，(CoNi)81Mo12Al7合金表现出强度、延展性和应变硬化能力的协同作用，实现了1086 MPa的屈服强度、1520 MPa的拉伸强度和35%的延伸率。通过透射电子显微镜进行的位错分析和密度泛函理论（DFT）计算的广义堆垛层错能量（GSFE）计算表明，L12相中钼替代铝会改变位错行为，促进多种变形模式的形成，包括堆垛层错、超位错对、Lomer-Cottrell锁和低应变下的异常纳米孪晶形成。这些行为得益于FCC基体的低堆垛层错能量（SFE）、SFs的重叠以及跨反相畴界（APBs）的位错解离。由于钼替代，与APBs相比，超晶格固有堆垛层错（SISF）形成的能量势垒增加，进一步影响了位错活动。本工作展示了一种通过扩大FCC基体和L12成分范围来实现高性能M/HEA设计的新策略，该策略侧重于沉淀硬化。

Abstract: L12 precipitates are known to significantly enhance the strength and
ductility of single-phase face-centered cubic (FCC) medium- or high-entropy
alloys (M/HEAs). However, further improvements in mechanical properties remain
untapped, as alloy design has historically focused on systems with specific
CrCoNi- or FeCoCrNi-based FCC matrix and Ni3Al L12 phase compositions. This
study introduces novel Co-Ni-Mo-Al alloys with L12 precipitates by
systematically altering Al content, aiming to bridge this research gap by
revealing the strengthening mechanisms. The (CoNi)81Mo12Al7 alloy achieves
yield strength of 1086 MPa, tensile strength of 1520 MPa, and ductility of 35
%, demonstrating an impressive synergy of strength, ductility, and
strain-hardening capacity. Dislocation analysis via transmission electron
microscopy, supported by generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE) calculations
using density functional theory (DFT), demonstrates that Mo substitution for Al
in the L12 phase alters dislocation behavior, promoting the formation of
multiple deformation modes, including stacking faults, super-dislocation pairs,
Lomer-Cottrell locks, and unusual nano-twin formation even at low strains.
These behaviors are facilitated by the low stacking fault energy (SFE) of the
FCC matrix, overlapping of SFs, and dislocation dissociation across anti-phase
boundaries (APBs). The increased energy barrier for superlattice intrinsic
stacking fault (SISF) formation compared to APBs, due to Mo substitution,
further influences dislocation activity. This work demonstrates a novel
strategy for designing high-performance M/HEAs by expanding the range of FCC
matrix and L12 compositions through precipitation hardening.

Method: 研究了使用硅和云母模板制造的模板剥离金基板上 WSe_2 的层依赖性电子结构，并与从头预测进行了对比。

Result: 观察到在布里渊区中心 $\overline{\Gamma}$ 周围的强杂化，表明金-WSe 相互作用中存在共价混合，以及表明 Au(111) / WSe_2 界面处电荷重排的能带移动。核心能级光谱显示界面 WSe_2 层在模板剥离金上只有一个化学环境，这与后续层不同。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了范德华相互作用和共价相互作用的混合物，最好被描述为具有中等相互作用强度的类共价准键合。

Abstract: Understanding the interface between metals and two-dimensional materials is
critical for their application in electronics and for the development of
metal-mediated exfoliation of large area monolayers. Studying the intricate
interactions at the interface requires model systems that enable control of the
roughness, purity, and crystallinity of the metal surface. Here, we investigate
the layer-dependent electronic structure of WSe_2 on template-stripped gold
substrates fabricated using both silicon and mica templates, giving
crystallographically disordered and Au(111) ordered surfaces, respectively, and
contrast these findings with ab initio predictions. We observe strong
hybridization around the Brillouin zone centre at $\overline{\Gamma}$,
indicating a covalent admixture in the gold-\WSe~interaction, and band shifts
that suggest charge rearrangement at the Au(111) / WSe_2 interface. Core-level
spectroscopy shows a single chemical environment for the interfacial WSe_2
layer on the template-stripped gold, distinct from the subsequent layers. These
results reveal a mixture of van der Waals and covalent interactions, best
described as a covalent-like quasi-bonding with intermediate interaction
strength.

TL;DR: 通过群论和从头分子动力学，我们量化了立方相CsBBr3（B = Pb、Sn和Ge）中孤对电子、卤化物极化、偏心和八面体倾斜的相互作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金属卤化物钙钛矿在太阳能、热电、催化和其他光化学技术方面具有巨大潜力，其性能源于电子结构驱动的性质。在ABX3卤化物钙钛石中，B位上的孤对电子或可极化的X-阴离子产生的局部且通常不对称的电子密度会使晶格变形。然而，电子结构涨落与BX6八面体倾斜和B位原子偏离其八面体中心等变形之间的关联尚不完全清楚。

Method: 使用群论和从头分子动力学。

Result: 孤对电子引起的偏心和八面体倾斜是独立于对称性的。B位离域孤对电子的立体化学表达与八面体倾斜相关，这是因为B位离子倾向于与周围的卤化物离子形成瞬态的部分共价键，从而增强了八面体倾斜模式。

Conclusion: 电子不对称性与结构波动相关，并且可以通过动态调节电子对称性来控制卤化物钙钛矿的功能特性。

Abstract: Metal halide perovskites show exceptional potential for solar energy,
thermoelectrics, catalysis, and other photochemical technologies, with
performance rooted in electronic structure-driven properties. In ABX3 halide
perovskites, localized and often aspherical local electron densities from
B-site lone pairs or polarizable X- anions can distort the lattice. However,
the links among electronic structure fluctuations and distortions like tilting
of the BX6 octahedra and off-centering of the B-site from the center of its
octahedron are not fully understood. Using group theory and ab initio molecular
dynamics, we quantify how lone pairs, halide polarization, off-centering, and
octahedral tilting interact in the cubic phase CsBBr3, with B = Pb, Sn, and Ge.
We find that lone pair-induced off-centering and octahedral tilting are
symmetry-decoupled. Instead, stereochemical lone pair expression of the B-site
ion is correlated to octahedral tilting through the propensity of the B-site to
form a transient, partial covalent bond with the surrounding halide ions that
stiffens octahedral tilting modes. These results link local electronic
asymmetry to structural fluctuations and suggest that dynamic modulation of
electronic symmetry offers a pathway to control functional properties in halide
perovskites.

TL;DR: 该基准测试表明，尽管机器学习势在三维材料上表现良好，但在模拟低维材料时准确性会下降。然而，一些模型（如equivariant Smooth Energy Network）在各种维度下都表现出了高精度，可以替代密度泛函理论计算。

Motivation: 评估通用机器学习原子间势在不同维度的系统上的预测能力。

Method: 提出一个基准测试，用于评估通用机器学习原子间势在不同维度的系统上的预测能力，该基准测试对零维（分子、原子簇等）、一维（纳米线、纳米带、纳米管等）、二维（原子层和薄片）和三维（块状材料）化合物进行了测试。

Result: 所有测试模型在三维系统上均表现出优异性能，但在低维结构上的准确性会逐步下降。在几何优化方面，性能最佳的模型是orbital version 2、equiformerV2和equivariant Smooth Energy Network；在能量预测方面，equivariant Smooth Energy Network也最为准确。最佳模型在所有维度上的平均原子位置误差在0.01-0.02埃范围内，能量误差低于10 meV/atom。

Conclusion: 与密度泛函理论计算相比，最先进的通用机器学习原子间势在计算成本一小部分的情况下，在跨越从孤立原子到块状固体的整个模拟范围内，已达到足够的准确性，可以作为其直接替代品。此外，性能最佳的模型已经能够对包含混合维度子系统的复杂系统进行有效模拟，为模拟真实材料和界面开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: We present a benchmark designed to evaluate the predictive capabilities of
universal machine learning interatomic potentials across systems of varying
dimensionality. Specifically, our benchmark tests zero- (molecules, atomic
clusters, etc.), one- (nanowires, nanoribbons, nanotubes, etc.), two- (atomic
layers and slabs) and three-dimensional (bulk materials) compounds. The
benchmark reveals that while all tested models demonstrate excellent
performance for three-dimensional systems, accuracy degrades progressively for
lower-dimensional structures. The best performing models for geometry
optimization are orbital version 2, equiformerV2, and the equivariant Smooth
Energy Network, with the equivariant Smooth Energy Network also providing the
most accurate energies. Our results indicate that the best models yield, on
average, errors in the atomic positions in the range of 0.01-0.02 angstrom and
errors in the energy below 10~meV/atom across all dimensionalities. These
results demonstrate that state-of-the-art universal machine learning
interatomic potentials have reached sufficient accuracy to serve as direct
replacements for density functional theory calculations, at a small fraction of
the computational cost, in simulations spanning the full range from isolated
atoms to bulk solids. More significantly, the best performing models already
enable efficient simulations of complex systems containing subsystems of mixed
dimensionality, opening new possibilities for modeling realistic materials and
interfaces.

TL;DR: 高次谐波光谱可用于诊断陈绝缘体和拓扑绝缘体的拓扑相，但对高次拓扑绝缘体的拓扑信号识别仍需进一步研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究旨在探索高次谐波光谱在研究拓扑材料（包括高次拓扑材料）中的应用潜力，特别是高次谐波产生相关的螺旋度、圆二色性和椭圆率依赖性等关键可观测量，以确定这些可观测量是否能揭示拓扑态的特征。

Method: 本研究采用理论方法，运用三种不同的模型——陈绝缘体哈尔达模型、拓扑绝缘体Kane-Mele模型以及高次拓扑绝缘体呼吸Kagome点阵模型——来研究高次谐波光谱在外尔半金属和高次拓扑绝缘体中的应用，并关注与高次谐波产生相关的几个关键可观测量，即螺旋度、圆二色性和椭圆率依赖性。

Result: 研究发现，对于陈绝缘体和拓扑绝缘体，所研究的可观测量（螺旋度、圆二色性和椭圆率依赖性）确实能够捕捉到拓扑相。然而，对于高次拓扑绝缘体，在谐波光谱中并未发现明确的拓扑信号。特别是，在Kagome点阵中发现了与拓扑半金属相相关的谐波增强，其幅度可达两到三个数量级。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，高次谐波光谱可以作为一种诊断拓扑相的独特工具，特别是与拓扑角态相关的相。对于陈绝缘体和拓扑绝缘体，所研究的可观测量可以捕捉拓扑相。然而，对于高次拓扑绝缘体，谐波光谱中没有出现明显的拓扑特征，这表明需要更仔细的分析来识别高次拓扑绝缘体中的拓扑不变量。

Abstract: Over the last decade, high-harmonic spectroscopy has been successfully
extended to the study of ultrafast electron motion in solids, shedding light on
fundamental processes such as Bloch oscillations and higher-order nonlinear
phenomena. In this work, we present theoretical studies of high-harmonic
spectroscopy applied to topological materials including higher-order ones,
focusing on several key observables associated with high-harmonic generation -
namely, helicity, circular dichroism, and ellipticity dependence. We extend
current all-optical measurement approaches from lower-order topological
insulators (LOTIs) to higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs), employing
three distinct models: a Haldane model for Chern insulators, Kane-Mele model
for topological insulators, and a breathing Kagome lattice for HOTIs. This work
aims to resolve whether helicity, circular dichroism, and ellipticity
dependence can reveal signatures of topological states. For the Chern
insulators and topological insulators, we find that these observables can
indeed capture topological phases. In contrast, for HOTIs, no clear signatures
of topology emerge in the harmonic spectrum, suggesting that a more careful
analysis is required to identify topological invariants in higher-order
topological insulators. In particular, for the topological semimetal phase, we
find a harmonic enhancement by two to three orders of magnitude in the Kagome
lattice. Our study delineates the conditions under which high-harmonic
spectroscopy serves as a unique tool for diagnosing topological phases,
particularly for those associated with topological corner states.

Abstract: Second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) for ab initio
simulations of solids is often limited by divergence or over-correlation
issues, particularly in metallic, narrow-gap, and dispersion-stabilized
systems. We develop and assess three regularized second-order perturbation
theories: $\kappa$-MP2, $\sigma$-MP2, and the size-consistent Brillouin-Wigner
approach (BW-s2), across metals, semiconductors, molecular crystals, and rare
gas solids. BW-s2 achieves high accuracy for cohesive energies, lattice
constants, and bulk moduli in metals, semiconductors, and molecular crystals,
rivaling or surpassing coupled-cluster with singles and doubles at lower cost.
In rare gas solids, where MP2 already underbinds, $\kappa$-MP2 does not make
the results much worse while BW-s2 struggles. These results illustrate both the
potential and the limitations of regularized perturbation theory for efficient
and accurate solid-state simulations. While broader testing is warranted,
BW-s2($\alpha$ = 2) appears particularly promising, with possible advantages
over modern random-phase approximations and coupled-cluster theory.

Abstract: In hazardous and remote environments, robotic systems perform critical tasks
demanding improved safety and efficiency. Among these, quadruped robots with
manipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations.
However, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of
integrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic
arm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces.
Teleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high
level of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load
on the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that
directly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler
and more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by
leveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external
camera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist
position. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to
control the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe
teleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and
the robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot,
demonstrating robust performance in real-time control. This teleoperation
approach provides a cost-effective solution for industrial applications where
safety, precision, and ease of use are paramount, ensuring reliable and
intuitive robotic control in high-risk environments.

*René Zurbrügg,Andrei Cramariuc,Marco Hutter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A new method using QP and MALA* optimizes grasp generation for more diverse and stable grips, creating a large dataset for 5,700 objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing grasp data generation methods rely on sampling-based algorithms or simplified force-closure analysis, leading to limited diversity and convergence to power grasps. This work aims to synthesize large-scale, diverse, and physically feasible grasps, including refined manipulations like pinches and tri-finger precision grasps.

Method: A differentiable energy formulation of force closure using Quadratic Program (QP) and an adjusted optimization method (MALA*) for improved performance by dynamically rejecting gradient steps.

Result: Significant improvements in grasp diversity and stability of final grasp predictions were demonstrated through extensive evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed method generates diverse and stable grasps beyond simple power grasps, offering significant improvements in grasp diversity and stability. A new large-scale dataset of 5,700 objects with five grippers and three grasp types is provided.

Abstract: Dexterous robotic hands enable versatile interactions due to the flexibility
and adaptability of multi-fingered designs, allowing for a wide range of
task-specific grasp configurations in diverse environments. However, to fully
exploit the capabilities of dexterous hands, access to diverse and high-quality
grasp data is essential -- whether for developing grasp prediction models from
point clouds, training manipulation policies, or supporting high-level task
planning with broader action options. Existing approaches for dataset
generation typically rely on sampling-based algorithms or simplified
force-closure analysis, which tend to converge to power grasps and often
exhibit limited diversity. In this work, we propose a method to synthesize
large-scale, diverse, and physically feasible grasps that extend beyond simple
power grasps to include refined manipulations, such as pinches and tri-finger
precision grasps. We introduce a rigorous, differentiable energy formulation of
force closure, implicitly defined through a Quadratic Program (QP).
Additionally, we present an adjusted optimization method (MALA*) that improves
performance by dynamically rejecting gradient steps based on the distribution
of energy values across all samples. We extensively evaluate our approach and
demonstrate significant improvements in both grasp diversity and the stability
of final grasp predictions. Finally, we provide a new, large-scale grasp
dataset for 5,700 objects from DexGraspNet, comprising five different grippers
and three distinct grasp types.

communication or control. We validate our system through real-world
experiments, demonstrating reliable deployment in diverse field conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of dynamic manipulation (increased dimensionality, complex dynamics, and partial observability) using the in-context learning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).

Method: An iterative approach is used, formulating the in-context learning problem to predict adjustments to a parametric policy based on previous interactions.

Result: In-context learning applied to dynamic manipulation outperforms alternative methods in the low data regime.

Conclusion: The study shows that in-context learning outperforms alternative methods in the low data regime for dynamic manipulation tasks, both in simulation and on a physical robot.

Abstract: Attention-based architectures trained on internet-scale language data have
demonstrated state of the art reasoning ability for various language-based
tasks, such as logic problems and textual reasoning. Additionally, these Large
Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited the ability to perform few-shot
prediction via in-context learning, in which input-output examples provided in
the prompt are generalized to new inputs. This ability furthermore extends
beyond standard language tasks, enabling few-shot learning for general
patterns. In this work, we consider the application of in-context learning with
pre-trained language models for dynamic manipulation. Dynamic manipulation
introduces several crucial challenges, including increased dimensionality,
complex dynamics, and partial observability. To address this, we take an
iterative approach, and formulate our in-context learning problem to predict
adjustments to a parametric policy based on previous interactions. We show
across several tasks in simulation and on a physical robot that utilizing
in-context learning outperforms alternative methods in the low data regime.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of modern robots remains challenging due to
their high degrees of freedom and intricate mechanisms. Neural simulators have
emerged as a promising alternative to traditional analytical simulators,
capable of efficiently predicting complex dynamics and adapting to real-world
data; however, existing neural simulators typically require
application-specific training and fail to generalize to novel tasks and/or
environments, primarily due to inadequate representations of the global state.
In this work, we address the problem of learning generalizable neural
simulators for robots that are structured as articulated rigid bodies. We
propose NeRD (Neural Robot Dynamics), learned robot-specific dynamics models
for predicting future states for articulated rigid bodies under contact
constraints. NeRD uniquely replaces the low-level dynamics and contact solvers
in an analytical simulator and employs a robot-centric and spatially-invariant
simulation state representation. We integrate the learned NeRD models as an
interchangeable backend solver within a state-of-the-art robotics simulator. We
conduct extensive experiments to show that the NeRD simulators are stable and
accurate over a thousand simulation steps; generalize across tasks and
environment configurations; enable policy learning exclusively in a neural
engine; and, unlike most classical simulators, can be fine-tuned from
real-world data to bridge the gap between simulation and reality.

Conclusion: 该研究证明了一个硬件在回路系统，可以在几分钟内学会控制具有冗余的肌腱驱动四足机器人，实现功能性和适应性的非凸周期性运动，为机器人动态适应新环境、保持适应性和性能铺平了道路。

Abstract: Like mammals, robots must rapidly learn to control their bodies and interact
with their environment despite incomplete knowledge of their body structure and
surroundings. They must also adapt to continuous changes in both. This work
presents a bio-inspired learning algorithm, General-to-Particular (G2P),
applied to a tendon-driven quadruped robotic system developed and fabricated
in-house. Our quadruped robot undergoes an initial five-minute phase of
generalized motor babbling, followed by 15 refinement trials (each lasting 20
seconds) to achieve specific cyclical movements. This process mirrors the
exploration-exploitation paradigm observed in mammals. With each refinement,
the robot progressively improves upon its initial "good enough" solution. Our
results serve as a proof-of-concept, demonstrating the hardware-in-the-loop
system's ability to learn the control of a tendon-driven quadruped with
redundancies in just a few minutes to achieve functional and adaptive cyclical
non-convex movements. By advancing autonomous control in robotic locomotion,
our approach paves the way for robots capable of dynamically adjusting to new
environments, ensuring sustained adaptability and performance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Mag-Match uses magnetic fields and advanced math (physics-informed Gaussian Process with higher-order derivatives) to match and register maps/robots, working even in smoke/dust and without needing gravity alignment, outperforming older methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the limitations of traditional camera/LiDAR-based map matching and registration methods in challenging environments (e.g., smoke, dust). Highlights the robustness and unique feature detection capabilities of magnetometers in such conditions.

Method: Introduces Mag-Match, a novel method using higher-order derivatives of 3D magnetic vector field maps for feature extraction and description. Leverages a physics-informed Gaussian Process for efficient, recursive probabilistic inference of the magnetic field and its derivatives from point-wise magnetometer data. The feature descriptor is invariant to global orientation, removing the need for gravity-aligned mapping.

Result: Mag-Match demonstrates accurate registration in simulated and real-world experiments, including map-to-map, robot-to-map, and robot-to-robot transformations, without requiring initial gravitational alignment. It shows improved performance compared to a SIFT-based approach.

Conclusion: Mag-Match methods achieve accurate map-to-map, robot-to-map, and robot-to-robot transformations, even without initial gravitational alignment, outperforming SIFT-based approaches in simulated and real-world experiments.

Abstract: Map matching and registration are essential tasks in robotics for
localisation and integration of multi-session or multi-robot data. Traditional
methods rely on cameras or LiDARs to capture visual or geometric information
but struggle in challenging conditions like smoke or dust. Magnetometers, on
the other hand, detect magnetic fields, revealing features invisible to other
sensors and remaining robust in such environments. In this paper, we introduce
Mag-Match, a novel method for extracting and describing features in 3D magnetic
vector field maps to register different maps of the same area. Our feature
descriptor, based on higher-order derivatives of magnetic field maps, is
invariant to global orientation, eliminating the need for gravity-aligned
mapping. To obtain these higher-order derivatives map-wide given point-wise
magnetometer data, we leverage a physics-informed Gaussian Process to perform
efficient and recursive probabilistic inference of both the magnetic field and
its derivatives. We evaluate Mag-Match in simulated and real-world experiments
against a SIFT-based approach, demonstrating accurate map-to-map, robot-to-map,
and robot-to-robot transformations - even without initial gravitational
alignment.

Abstract: The logistics and construction industries face persistent challenges in
automating pallet handling, especially in outdoor environments with variable
payloads, inconsistencies in pallet quality and dimensions, and unstructured
surroundings. In this paper, we tackle automation of a critical step in pallet
transport: the pallet pick-up operation. Our work is motivated by labor
shortages, safety concerns, and inefficiencies in manually locating and
retrieving pallets under such conditions. We present Lang2Lift, a framework
that leverages foundation models for natural language-guided pallet detection
and 6D pose estimation, enabling operators to specify targets through intuitive
commands such as "pick up the steel beam pallet near the crane." The perception
pipeline integrates Florence-2 and SAM-2 for language-grounded segmentation
with FoundationPose for robust pose estimation in cluttered, multi-pallet
outdoor scenes under variable lighting. The resulting poses feed into a motion
planning module for fully autonomous forklift operation. We validate Lang2Lift
on the ADAPT autonomous forklift platform, achieving 0.76 mIoU pallet
segmentation accuracy on a real-world test dataset. Timing and error analysis
demonstrate the system's robustness and confirm its feasibility for deployment
in operational logistics and construction environments. Video demonstrations

Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for evaluating progress in robotics and embodied AI.
However, a significant gap exists between benchmarks designed for high-level
language instruction following, which often assume perfect low-level execution,
and those for low-level robot control, which rely on simple, one-step commands.
This disconnect prevents a comprehensive evaluation of integrated systems where
both task planning and physical execution are critical. To address this, we
propose Kitchen-R, a novel benchmark that unifies the evaluation of task
planning and low-level control within a simulated kitchen environment. Built as
a digital twin using the Isaac Sim simulator and featuring more than 500
complex language instructions, Kitchen-R supports a mobile manipulator robot.
We provide baseline methods for our benchmark, including a task-planning
strategy based on a vision-language model and a low-level control policy based
on diffusion policy. We also provide a trajectory collection system. Our
benchmark offers a flexible framework for three evaluation modes: independent
assessment of the planning module, independent assessment of the control
policy, and, crucially, an integrated evaluation of the whole system. Kitchen-R
bridges a key gap in embodied AI research, enabling more holistic and realistic
benchmarking of language-guided robotic agents.

Abstract: Learning-based methods for dexterous manipulation have made notable progress
in recent years. However, learned policies often still lack reliability and
exhibit limited robustness to important factors of variation. One failure
pattern that can be observed across many settings is that policies idle, i.e.
they cease to move beyond a small region of states when they reach certain
states. This policy idling is often a reflection of the training data. For
instance, it can occur when the data contains small actions in areas where the
robot needs to perform high-precision motions, e.g., when preparing to grasp an
object or object insertion. Prior works have tried to mitigate this phenomenon
e.g. by filtering the training data or modifying the control frequency.
However, these approaches can negatively impact policy performance in other
ways. As an alternative, we investigate how to leverage the detectability of
idling behavior to inform exploration and policy improvement. Our approach,
Pause-Induced Perturbations (PIP), applies perturbations at detected idling
states, thus helping it to escape problematic basins of attraction. On a range
of challenging simulated dual-arm tasks, we find that this simple approach can
already noticeably improve test-time performance, with no additional
supervision or training. Furthermore, since the robot tends to idle at critical
points in a movement, we also find that learning from the resulting episodes
leads to better iterative policy improvement compared to prior approaches. Our
perturbation strategy also leads to a 15-35% improvement in absolute success
rate on a real-world insertion task that requires complex multi-finger
manipulation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This study proposes a dynamic coupling-informed trajectory optimization
algorithm for free-floating space manipulator systems (SMSs). Dynamic coupling
between the base and the manipulator arms plays a critical role in influencing
the system's behavior. While prior research has predominantly focused on
minimizing this coupling, often overlooking its potential advantages, this work
investigates how dynamic coupling can instead be leveraged to improve
trajectory planning. Singular value decomposition (SVD) of the dynamic coupling
matrix is employed to identify the dominant components governing coupling
behavior. A quantitative metric is then formulated to characterize the strength
and directionality of the coupling and is incorporated into a trajectory

a sliding mode control-based tracking controller is designed to generate the

accounting for dynamic coupling in trajectory planning enables more informed
and potentially more efficient operation, offering new directions for the

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的混合现实场景重照明方法，该方法结合了图像分割、光照传播和场景理解，解决了现有方法的局限性，实现了实时、高精度的重照明效果，并展示了其在房地产行业的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的混合现实场景重照明技术要么无法达到当前混合现实设备的实时性能，要么因扫描限制导致精度不足，要么因只使用简单的2D图像滤镜而无法处理复杂的几何和阴影。

Method: 通过结合图像分割、基于各向异性扩散的光照传播以及基础场景理解，并利用基于滤镜技术的计算简便性，来修正设备扫描的不足之处。

Result: 该方法修正了设备扫描的不足之处，在边缘设备上实现了实时、视觉上吸引人且准确的重照明效果，速度高达100帧/秒。

Abstract: Mixed Reality scene relighting, where virtual changes to lighting conditions
realistically interact with physical objects, producing authentic illumination
and shadows, can be used in a variety of applications. One such application in
real estate could be visualizing a room at different times of day and placing
virtual light fixtures. Existing deep learning-based relighting techniques
typically exceed the real-time performance capabilities of current MR devices.
On the other hand, scene understanding methods, such as on-device scene
reconstruction, often yield inaccurate results due to scanning limitations, in
turn affecting relighting quality. Finally, simpler 2D image filter-based
approaches cannot represent complex geometry and shadows. We introduce a novel
method to integrate image segmentation, with lighting propagation via
anisotropic diffusion on top of basic scene understanding, and the
computational simplicity of filter-based techniques. Our approach corrects
on-device scanning inaccuracies, delivering visually appealing and accurate
relighting effects in real-time on edge devices, achieving speeds as high as
100 fps. We show a direct comparison between our method and the industry
standard, and present a practical demonstration of our method in the
aforementioned real estate example.

TL;DR: DeCoDi是一种新的去偏方法，它通过修改推理过程来提高文本到图像扩散模型的公平性，同时保持图像质量并最小化计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在开发一种易于使用的、计算开销小的偏差消除方法，以提高扩散模型生成图像的多样性。

Method: DeCoDi是一种通过改变推理过程来消除文本到图像扩散模型偏差的程序，它避免了潜在维度中存在偏差的概念区域，并且计算开销可忽略不计。

Result: DeCoDi在消除性别、种族和年龄方面的偏差方面被证明是有效的，并且其自动评估结果与人工评估结果在统计上没有显著差异。

Conclusion: DeCoDi在减轻基于性别、种族和年龄的偏差方面是有效的，并且与人类评估者和GPT4o的评估结果一致，有潜力提高图像生成的多样性。

Abstract: We propose DeCoDi, a debiasing procedure for text-to-image diffusion-based
models that changes the inference procedure, does not significantly change
image quality, has negligible compute overhead, and can be applied in any
diffusion-based image generation model. DeCoDi changes the diffusion process to
avoid latent dimension regions of biased concepts. While most deep learning
debiasing methods require complex or compute-intensive interventions, our
method is designed to change only the inference procedure. Therefore, it is
more accessible to a wide range of practitioners. We show the effectiveness of
the method by debiasing for gender, ethnicity, and age for the concepts of
nurse, firefighter, and CEO. Two distinct human evaluators manually inspect
1,200 generated images. Their evaluation results provide evidence that our
method is effective in mitigating biases based on gender, ethnicity, and age.
We also show that an automatic bias evaluation performed by the GPT4o is not
significantly statistically distinct from a human evaluation. Our evaluation
shows promising results, with reliable levels of agreement between evaluators
and more coverage of protected attributes. Our method has the potential to
significantly improve the diversity of images it generates by diffusion-based
text-to-image generative models.

TL;DR: 为了在准确性和可解释性之间取得更好的平衡，研究人员提出了一种基于局部最优性保证的新框架，该框架通过多目标搜索和SAT求解器，能够更具扩展性地合成高质量的模型解释。

Conclusion: 该方法在保证局部最优性的同时，能够更具扩展性地合成解释，并且在解释的准确性和可解释性之间取得了良好的权衡。

Abstract: Creating meaningful interpretations for black-box machine learning models
involves balancing two often conflicting objectives: accuracy and
explainability. Exploring the trade-off between these objectives is essential
for developing trustworthy interpretations. While many techniques for
multi-objective interpretation synthesis have been developed, they typically
lack formal guarantees on the Pareto-optimality of the results. Methods that do
provide such guarantees, on the other hand, often face severe scalability
limitations when exploring the Pareto-optimal space. To address this, we
develop a framework based on local optimality guarantees that enables more
scalable synthesis of interpretations. Specifically, we consider the problem of
synthesizing a set of Pareto-optimal interpretations with local optimality
guarantees, within the immediate neighborhood of each solution. Our approach
begins with a multi-objective learning or search technique, such as
Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search, to generate a best-effort set of
Pareto-optimal candidates with respect to accuracy and explainability. We then
verify local optimality for each candidate as a Boolean satisfiability problem,
which we solve using a SAT solver. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach
on a set of benchmarks, comparing it against previous methods for exploring the
Pareto-optimal front of interpretations. In particular, we show that our
approach yields interpretations that closely match those synthesized by methods
offering global guarantees.

Conclusion: 本文为生成式平衡算子（GEO）在解决凸优化问题时，弥合了理论与实践之间的差距，证明了GEO可以以任意精度统一逼近相应的解，并且秩、深度和宽度仅以近似误差倒数的对数增长。

Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) are a class of deep learning models designed to
simultaneously solve infinitely many related problems by casting them into an
infinite-dimensional space, whereon these NOs operate. A significant gap
remains between theory and practice: worst-case parameter bounds from universal
approximation theorems suggest that NOs may require an unrealistically large
number of parameters to solve most operator learning problems, which stands in
direct opposition to a slew of experimental evidence. This paper closes that
gap for a specific class of {NOs}, generative {equilibrium operators} (GEOs),
using (realistic) finite-dimensional deep equilibrium layers, when solving
families of convex optimization problems over a separable Hilbert space $X$.
Here, the inputs are smooth, convex loss functions on $X$, and outputs are the
associated (approximate) solutions to the optimization problem defined by each
input loss.
  We show that when the input losses lie in suitable infinite-dimensional
compact sets, our GEO can uniformly approximate the corresponding solutions to
arbitrary precision, with rank, depth, and width growing only logarithmically
in the reciprocal of the approximation error. We then validate both our
theoretical results and the trainability of GEOs on three applications: (1)
nonlinear PDEs, (2) stochastic optimal control problems, and (3) hedging
problems in mathematical finance under liquidity constraints.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles hold great promise for reducing traffic fatalities and
improving transportation efficiency, yet their widespread adoption hinges on
embedding robust ethical reasoning into routine and emergency maneuvers. Here,
we present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that
explicitly integrates moral considerations with standard driving objectives. At
the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk
cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level
motion targets. A dynamic Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies
learning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level,
polynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)
and Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible
trajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our
approach on rich, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles,
cyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods
in reducing ethical risk and maintaining driving performance. To our knowledge,
this is the first study of ethical decision-making for autonomous vehicles via
Safe RL in real-world scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of
combining formal control theory and data-driven learning to advance ethically
accountable autonomy in complex, human-mixed traffic environments.

Abstract: Neural network image classifiers are ubiquitous in many safety-critical
applications. However, they are susceptible to adversarial attacks. To
understand their robustness to attacks, many local robustness verifiers have
been proposed to analyze $\epsilon$-balls of inputs. Yet, existing verifiers
introduce a long analysis time or lose too much precision, making them less
effective for a large set of inputs. In this work, we propose a new approach to
local robustness: group local robustness verification. The key idea is to
leverage the similarity of the network computations of certain $\epsilon$-balls
to reduce the overall analysis time. We propose BaVerLy, a sound and complete
verifier that boosts the local robustness verification of a set of
$\epsilon$-balls by dynamically constructing and verifying mini-batches.
BaVerLy adaptively identifies successful mini-batch sizes, accordingly
constructs mini-batches of $\epsilon$-balls that have similar network
computations, and verifies them jointly. If a mini-batch is verified, all
$\epsilon$-balls are proven robust. Otherwise, one $\epsilon$-ball is suspected
as not being robust, guiding the refinement. In the latter case, BaVerLy
leverages the analysis results to expedite the analysis of that $\epsilon$-ball
as well as the other $\epsilon$-balls in the batch. We evaluate BaVerLy on
fully connected and convolutional networks for MNIST and CIFAR-10. Results show
that BaVerLy scales the common one by one verification by 2.3x on average and
up to 4.1x, in which case it reduces the total analysis time from 24 hours to 6
hours.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于 DeepONet 的输出可以看作是关于分支网络最后一层参数的线性函数，因此可以使用最小二乘 (LS) 求解来优化这些参数，并且使用梯度下降形式更新剩余的隐藏层参数。然而，为所有可能的 'branch' 和 'trunk' 输入组合构建 LS 系统会产生一个非常大的线性问题，无法直接求解。

Method: 提出了一种有效的混合最小二乘/梯度下降方法来加速 DeepONet 训练。

Result: 将大的 LS 系统分解为两个更小的子问题，分别求解，以解决直接求解大规模线性问题不可行的问题。}}

Conclusion: 该方法将大的最小二乘系统分解为两个更小、更易于管理的子问题——一个用于分支网络，一个用于主干网络——并分别求解。该方法推广到更广泛类型的 $L^2$ 损失，并在最后一层参数中包含正则化项，包括带有物理信息损失的无监督学习情况。

Abstract: We propose an efficient hybrid least squares/gradient descent method to
accelerate DeepONet training. Since the output of DeepONet can be viewed as
linear with respect to the last layer parameters of the branch network, these
parameters can be optimized using a least squares (LS) solve, and the remaining
hidden layer parameters are updated by means of gradient descent form. However,
building the LS system for all possible combinations of branch and trunk inputs
yields a prohibitively large linear problem that is infeasible to solve
directly. To address this issue, our method decomposes the large LS system into
two smaller, more manageable subproblems $\unicode{x2014}$ one for the branch
network and one for the trunk network $\unicode{x2014}$ and solves them
separately. This method is generalized to a broader type of $L^2$ loss with a
regularization term for the last layer parameters, including the case of
unsupervised learning with physics-informed loss.

TL;DR: 为了解决肺癌风险预测的挑战，我们提出了一个能动态选择最合适模型的个性化代理，通过FAISS进行队列检索，并通过LLM进行最优模型推荐，以实现个体化风险评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的肺癌风险预测仍然具有挑战性，因为患者人群和临床环境存在巨大差异，没有单一模型适用于所有队列。

Method: 该代理首先使用基于FAISS的相似性搜索，在九个不同的真实世界队列中进行队列检索，以识别多机构数据库中最相关的患者人群。然后，利用大型语言模型（LLM）根据检索到的队列及其性能指标，从八个代表性模型（包括线性风险模型、时间感知模型和多模态计算机视觉模型）中推荐最优的预测算法。

Result: 该两阶段代理（通过FAISS检索和LLM推理）实现了动态的、队列感知的风险预测，并为每个患者的个人情况进行了定制。该代理支持跨不同临床人群的灵活且由队列驱动的模型选择，为个体化风险评估提供了实际途径。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种个性化的肺癌风险预测代理，通过结合队列特定知识和现代检索与推理技术，为每位患者动态选择最合适的模型，以应对肺癌风险预测的挑战。

Abstract: Accurate lung cancer risk prediction remains challenging due to substantial
variability across patient populations and clinical settings -- no single model
performs best for all cohorts. To address this, we propose a personalized lung
cancer risk prediction agent that dynamically selects the most appropriate
model for each patient by combining cohort-specific knowledge with modern
retrieval and reasoning techniques. Given a patient's CT scan and structured
metadata -- including demographic, clinical, and nodule-level features -- the
agent first performs cohort retrieval using FAISS-based similarity search
across nine diverse real-world cohorts to identify the most relevant patient
population from a multi-institutional database. Second, a Large Language Model
(LLM) is prompted with the retrieved cohort and its associated performance
metrics to recommend the optimal prediction algorithm from a pool of eight
representative models, including classical linear risk models (e.g., Mayo,
Brock), temporally-aware models (e.g., TDVIT, DLSTM), and multi-modal computer
vision-based approaches (e.g., Liao, Sybil, DLS, DLI). This two-stage agent
pipeline -- retrieval via FAISS and reasoning via LLM -- enables dynamic,
cohort-aware risk prediction personalized to each patient's profile. Building
on this architecture, the agent supports flexible and cohort-driven model
selection across diverse clinical populations, offering a practical path toward
individualized risk assessment in real-world lung cancer screening.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenges of symptom evolution complexity and
insufficient temporal dependency modeling in Parkinson's disease progression
prediction. It proposes a unified prediction framework that integrates
structural perception and temporal modeling. The method leverages graph neural
networks to model the structural relationships among multimodal clinical
symptoms and introduces graph-based representations to capture semantic
dependencies between symptoms. It also incorporates a Transformer architecture
to model dynamic temporal features during disease progression. To fuse
structural and temporal information, a structure-aware gating mechanism is
designed to dynamically adjust the fusion weights between structural encodings
and temporal features, enhancing the model's ability to identify key
progression stages. To improve classification accuracy and stability, the
framework includes a multi-component modeling pipeline, consisting of a graph
construction module, a temporal encoding module, and a prediction output layer.
The model is evaluated on real-world longitudinal Parkinson's disease data. The
experiments involve comparisons with mainstream models, sensitivity analysis of
hyperparameters, and graph connection density control. Results show that the
proposed method outperforms existing approaches in AUC, RMSE, and IPW-F1
metrics. It effectively distinguishes progression stages and improves the
model's ability to capture personalized symptom trajectories. The overall
framework demonstrates strong generalization and structural scalability,
providing reliable support for intelligent modeling of chronic progressive
diseases such as Parkinson's disease.

Conclusion: HHNAS-AM在Spider数据集上实现了8%的测试准确率提升，并在数据库ID预测任务中发现了高性能模型。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has garnered significant research interest
due to its capability to discover architectures superior to manually designed
ones. Learning text representation is crucial for text classification and other
language-related tasks. The NAS model used in text classification does not have
a Hybrid hierarchical structure, and there is no restriction on the
architecture structure, due to which the search space becomes very large and
mostly redundant, so the existing RL models are not able to navigate the search
space effectively. Also, doing a flat architecture search leads to an
unorganised search space, which is difficult to traverse. For this purpose, we
propose HHNAS-AM (Hierarchical Hybrid Neural Architecture Search with Adaptive
Mutation Policies), a novel approach that efficiently explores diverse
architectural configurations. We introduce a few architectural templates to
search on which organise the search spaces, where search spaces are designed on
the basis of domain-specific cues. Our method employs mutation strategies that
dynamically adapt based on performance feedback from previous iterations using
Q-learning, enabling a more effective and accelerated traversal of the search
space. The proposed model is fully probabilistic, enabling effective
exploration of the search space. We evaluate our approach on the database id
(db_id) prediction task, where it consistently discovers high-performing
architectures across multiple experiments. On the Spider dataset, our method
achieves an 8% improvement in test accuracy over existing baselines.

Motivation: Existing auto-partitioners for large machine learning models suffer from out-of-memory errors or are too slow due to the vast search space of possible partitionings. Current methods artificially restrict this space, leading to infeasible or sub-optimal solutions.

Method: The system uses a novel static compiler analysis to identify tensor dimensions requiring identical sharding and partitioning conflicts, combined with Monte Carlo Tree Search to explore the decision space. This approach efficiently manages the search space, avoiding out-of-memory errors and sub-optimal performance.

Result: The system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art industrial methods across diverse hardware platforms and model architectures. It discovers previously unknown, superior solutions and automates the partitioning process even for complex and large models.

Conclusion: The proposed system combines static compiler analysis with Monte Carlo Tree Search to efficiently partition large machine learning models across distributed accelerator systems. It outperforms state-of-the-art industrial methods, discovering superior solutions automatically for complex models.

Abstract: Partitioning large machine learning models across distributed accelerator
systems is a complex process, requiring a series of interdependent decisions
that are further complicated by internal sharding ambiguities. Consequently,
existing auto-partitioners often suffer from out-of-memory errors or are
prohibitively slow when exploring the exponentially large space of possible
partitionings. To mitigate this, they artificially restrict the search space,
but this approach frequently yields infeasible solutions that violate device
memory constraints or lead to sub-optimal performance.
  We propose a system that combines a novel static compiler analysis with a
Monte Carlo Tree Search. Our analysis constructs an efficient decision space by
identifying (i) tensor dimensions requiring identical sharding, and (ii)
partitioning "conflicts" that require resolution.
  Our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art industrial methods
across diverse hardware platforms and model architectures, discovering
previously unknown, superior solutions, and the process is fully automated even
for complex and large models.

TL;DR: LPO is a new alignment framework that improves upon DPO by addressing overfitting and collapse through gradient decoupling, an offset constraint with regularization, and controllable rejection suppression, leading to better performance across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) is prone to overfitting and collapse, prompting the development of LPO to address these challenges.

Method: The proposed LPO framework introduces three key innovations: 1. Gradient decoupling using an absolute difference loss instead of a log-sigmoid function to isolate optimization dynamics. 2. Improved stability through an offset constraint and a positive regularization term to maintain chosen response quality. 3. Controllable rejection suppression using gradient separation with straightforward estimation and a tunable coefficient to regulate rejection probability.

Result: Extensive experiments show LPO consistently improves performance on general text tasks, math tasks, and text-to-speech (TTS) tasks.

Conclusion: LPO (Linear Preference Optimization) is a robust and tunable paradigm for preference alignment that consistently improves performance on various tasks.

Abstract: DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) has become a widely used offline
preference optimization algorithm due to its simplicity and training stability.
However, DPO is prone to overfitting and collapse. To address these challenges,
we propose Linear Preference Optimization (LPO), a novel alignment framework
featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce gradient decoupling by
replacing the log-sigmoid function with an absolute difference loss, thereby
isolating the optimization dynamics. Second, we improve stability through an
offset constraint combined with a positive regularization term to preserve the
chosen response quality. Third, we implement controllable rejection suppression
using gradient separation with straightforward estimation and a tunable
coefficient that linearly regulates the descent of the rejection probability.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LPO consistently improves
performance on various tasks, including general text tasks, math tasks, and
text-to-speech (TTS) tasks. These results establish LPO as a robust and tunable
paradigm for preference alignment, and we release the source code, models, and
training data publicly.

TL;DR: LFM4Ads 框架通过传输所有类型的表示（URs、IRs、CRs）并采用多粒度传输机制，解决了现有广告推荐模型利用预训练模型时的局限性，并在腾讯广告平台实现了显著的业务增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线广告推荐模型在利用预训练大型基础模型（LFMs）时存在局限性，仅提取和传输用户表示（URs），忽略了物品表示（IRs）和用户-物品交叉表示（CRs），并且未能有效解决预训练与下游应用之间的差异，忽略了更精细的传输粒度。

Method: 该研究提出了一种名为 LFM4Ads 的“全表征多粒度”传输框架，用于广告推荐。该框架全面传输预训练大型基础模型（LFMs）中包含的用户表示（URs）、物品表示（IRs）和用户-物品交叉表示（CRs）。为了有效利用 CRs，研究确定了最佳提取层并将其聚合为可传输的粗粒度形式。此外，通过非线性适配器（特征级传输）、同构交互模块（模块级传输）和独立检索（模型级传输）的多粒度机制来增强可传输性。

Result: LFM4Ads 框架在腾讯广告平台成功部署，处理日均千亿级别样本，模型参数达 TB 级，特征近两千个。自 2024 年第四季度上线以来，已在微信朋友圈、视频号等主要场景成功上线十余次，整体 GMV 提升 2.45%，预计年收入增加数亿美元。

Conclusion: LFM4Ads 框架在腾讯的广告平台得到成功部署，处理海量日活数据，并实现了显著的业务增长，包括 GMV 提升 2.45%，预计年收入增加数亿美元。

Abstract: Online advertising relies on accurate recommendation models, with recent
advances using pre-trained large-scale foundation models (LFMs) to capture
users' general interests across multiple scenarios and tasks. However, existing
methods have critical limitations: they extract and transfer only user
representations (URs), ignoring valuable item representations (IRs) and
user-item cross representations (CRs); and they simply use a UR as a feature in
downstream applications, which fails to bridge upstream-downstream gaps and
overlooks more transfer granularities. In this paper, we propose LFM4Ads, an
All-Representation Multi-Granularity transfer framework for ads recommendation.
It first comprehensively transfers URs, IRs, and CRs, i.e., all available
representations in the pre-trained foundation model. To effectively utilize the
CRs, it identifies the optimal extraction layer and aggregates them into
transferable coarse-grained forms. Furthermore, we enhance the transferability
via multi-granularity mechanisms: non-linear adapters for feature-level
transfer, an Isomorphic Interaction Module for module-level transfer, and
Standalone Retrieval for model-level transfer. LFM4Ads has been successfully
deployed in Tencent's industrial-scale advertising platform, processing tens of
billions of daily samples while maintaining terabyte-scale model parameters
with billions of sparse embedding keys across approximately two thousand
features. Since its production deployment in Q4 2024, LFM4Ads has achieved 10+
successful production launches across various advertising scenarios, including
primary ones like Weixin Moments and Channels. These launches achieve an
overall GMV lift of 2.45% across the entire platform, translating to estimated
annual revenue increases in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Abstract: This paper studies an input-driven one-state differential equation model
initially developed for an experimentally demonstrated dynamic molecular switch
that switches like synapses in the brain do. The linear-in-the-state and
nonlinear-in-the-input model is exactly solvable, and it is shown that it also
possesses mathematical properties of convergence and fading memory that enable
stable processing of time-varying inputs by nonlinear dynamical systems. Thus,
the model exhibits the co-existence of biologically-inspired behavior and
desirable mathematical properties for stable learning on sequential data. The
results give theoretical support for the use of the dynamic molecular switches
as computational units in deep cascaded/layered feedforward and recurrent
architectures as well as other more general structures for neuromorphic
computing. They could also inspire more general exactly solvable models that
can be fitted to emulate arbitrary physical devices which can mimic
brain-inspired behaviour and perform stable computation on input signals.

Abstract: We address the problem of detecting adversarial attacks against cooperative
multi-agent reinforcement learning with continuous action space. We propose a
decentralized detector that relies solely on the local observations of the
agents and makes use of a statistical characterization of the normal behavior
of observable agents. The proposed detector utilizes deep neural networks to
approximate the normal behavior of agents as parametric multivariate Gaussian
distributions. Based on the predicted density functions, we define a normality
score and provide a characterization of its mean and variance. This
characterization allows us to employ a two-sided CUSUM procedure for detecting
deviations of the normality score from its mean, serving as a detector of
anomalous behavior in real-time. We evaluate our scheme on various multi-agent
PettingZoo benchmarks against different state-of-the-art attack methods, and
our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting impactful
adversarial attacks. Particularly, it outperforms the discrete counterpart by
achieving AUC-ROC scores of over 0.95 against the most impactful attacks in all
evaluated environments.

TL;DR: CuMoLoS-MAE是一种新的深度学习模型，可以修复受噪声干扰的大气数据，恢复细节并估算不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的大气剖面数据修复方法（如插值）会模糊精细尺度结构，而深度模型缺乏不确定性估计，这限制了其在诊断对流、数据同化和气候再分析等方面的应用。需要一种能够恢复精细尺度特征并量化不确定性的方法。

Method: CuMoLoS-MAE（课程指导的蒙特卡洛随机集成掩码自动编码器）是一种深度学习模型，它利用ViT解码器，通过掩码率课程（mask-ratio curriculum）逐步从稀疏的上下文进行重建。在推理时，通过对随机掩码实现进行蒙特卡洛采样，多次评估MAE并聚合输出来获得后验预测均值重建和逐像素不确定性图。

Result: CuMoLoS-MAE能够高保真地重建大气剖面，恢复如上升和下降气流核心、剪切线和小涡旋等精细尺度特征，并生成精确的像素级不确定性图。这有助于改进对流诊断、支持实时数据同化和提高长期气候再分析的质量。

Conclusion: CuMoLoS-MAE通过课程指导的蒙特卡洛随机集成掩码自动编码器，能够准确地恢复大气剖面数据，并量化像素级不确定性，解决了传统方法模糊精细结构和深度模型缺乏置信度估计的问题。该方法通过掩码率课程和蒙特卡洛推断，实现了高保真重建，并为对流诊断、数据同化和气候再分析提供了支持。

Abstract: Accurate atmospheric profiles from remote sensing instruments such as Doppler
Lidar, Radar, and radiometers are frequently corrupted by low-SNR (Signal to
Noise Ratio) gates, range folding, and spurious discontinuities. Traditional
gap filling blurs fine-scale structures, whereas deep models lack confidence
estimates. We present CuMoLoS-MAE, a Curriculum-Guided Monte Carlo Stochastic
Ensemble Masked Autoencoder designed to (i) restore fine-scale features such as
updraft and downdraft cores, shear lines, and small vortices, (ii) learn a
data-driven prior over atmospheric fields, and (iii) quantify pixel-wise
uncertainty. During training, CuMoLoS-MAE employs a mask-ratio curriculum that
forces a ViT decoder to reconstruct from progressively sparser context. At
inference, we approximate the posterior predictive by Monte Carlo over random
mask realisations, evaluating the MAE multiple times and aggregating the
outputs to obtain the posterior predictive mean reconstruction together with a
finely resolved per-pixel uncertainty map. Together with high-fidelity
reconstruction, this novel deep learning-based workflow enables enhanced
convection diagnostics, supports real-time data assimilation, and improves
long-term climate reanalysis.

Abstract: Aura-CAPTCHA was developed as a multi-modal CAPTCHA system to address
vulnerabilities in traditional methods that are increasingly bypassed by AI
technologies, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and adversarial image
processing. The design integrated Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for
generating dynamic image challenges, Reinforcement Learning (RL) for adaptive

prompts. Visual challenges included 3x3 grid selections with at least three
correct images, while audio challenges combined randomized numbers and words
into a single task. RL adjusted difficulty based on incorrect attempts,
response time, and suspicious user behavior. Evaluations on real-world traffic
demonstrated a 92% human success rate and a 10% bot bypass rate, significantly
outperforming existing CAPTCHA systems. The system provided a robust and
scalable approach for securing online applications while remaining accessible
to users, addressing gaps highlighted in previous research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a more efficient self-supervised learning method for ECG analysis using multiple temporal windows, achieving better results with less training time than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-supervised contrastive learning methods for ECG analysis often use only pairwise augmented views and do not fully leverage the temporal structure of ECG recordings, despite limited access to annotated data.

Method: The paper proposes a poly-window contrastive learning framework that extracts multiple temporal windows from ECG instances to create positive pairs, maximizing agreement through statistics and encouraging the learning of temporally invariant features, inspired by slow feature analysis.

Result: The proposed poly-window contrastive learning framework achieved higher AUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) compared to conventional two-view methods in multi-label superclass classification on the PTB-XL dataset. It also required fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and reduced total wall clock pre-training time by 14.8%.

Conclusion: Poly-window contrastive learning is an efficient and scalable paradigm for automated ECG analysis, outperforming traditional two-view methods and reducing pre-training time. It offers a promising general framework for self-supervised representation learning in biomedical time-series data.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is foundational for cardiovascular disease
diagnosis, yet the performance of deep learning models is often constrained by
limited access to annotated data. Self-supervised contrastive learning has
emerged as a powerful approach for learning robust ECG representations from
unlabeled signals. However, most existing methods generate only pairwise
augmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG
recordings. In this work, we present a poly-window contrastive learning
framework. We extract multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to
construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired
by the principle of slow feature analysis, our approach explicitly encourages
the model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features
that persist across time. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments and ablation studies on the PTB-XL dataset. Our results demonstrate
that poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional
two-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher
AUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to
four times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock
pre-training time reduction. Despite processing multiple windows per sample, we
achieve a significant reduction in the number of training epochs and total
computation time, making our method practical for training foundational models.
Through extensive ablations, we identify optimal design choices and demonstrate
robustness across various hyperparameters. These findings establish poly-window
contrastive learning as a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated
ECG analysis and provide a promising general framework for self-supervised
representation learning in biomedical time-series data.

Conclusion: 联邦学习在噪声水平和数据分布变化的情况下，随着参与客户端数量的增加，能够持续改进任何单个客户端的收敛性。

Abstract: We consider federated learning of linearly-parameterized nonlinear systems.
We establish theoretical guarantees on the effectiveness of federated nonlinear
system identification compared to centralized approaches, demonstrating that
the convergence rate improves as the number of clients increases. Although the
convergence rates in the linear and nonlinear cases differ only by a constant,
this constant depends on the feature map $\phi$, which can be carefully chosen
in the nonlinear setting to increase excitation and improve performance. We
experimentally validate our theory in physical settings where client devices
are driven by i.i.d. control inputs and control policies exhibiting i.i.d.
random perturbations, ensuring non-active exploration. Experiments use
trajectories from nonlinear dynamical systems characterized by real-analytic
feature functions, including polynomial and trigonometric components,
representative of physical systems including pendulum and quadrotor dynamics.
We analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed method under varying noise
levels and data distributions. Results show that federated learning
consistently improves convergence of any individual client as the number of
participating clients increases.

Abstract: Graph neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success in predicting
molecular properties by leveraging the rich structural information encoded in
molecular graphs. However, their black-box nature reduces interpretability,
which limits trust in their predictions for important applications such as drug
discovery and materials design. Furthermore, existing explanation techniques
often fail to reliably quantify the contribution of individual atoms or
substructures due to the entangled message-passing dynamics. We introduce SEAL
(Substructure Explanation via Attribution Learning), a new interpretable graph
neural network that attributes model predictions to meaningful molecular
subgraphs. SEAL decomposes input graphs into chemically relevant fragments and
estimates their causal influence on the output. The strong alignment between
fragment contributions and model predictions is achieved by explicitly reducing
inter-fragment message passing in our proposed model architecture. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that SEAL outperforms other explainability methods in both
quantitative attribution metrics and human-aligned interpretability. A user
study further confirms that SEAL provides more intuitive and trustworthy
explanations to domain experts. By bridging the gap between predictive
performance and interpretability, SEAL offers a promising direction for more
transparent and actionable molecular modeling.

TL;DR: Twin-Boot integrates uncertainty estimation into deep learning optimization by training two models in parallel on bootstrap samples, using their divergence to guide regularization and improve calibration, generalization, and uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard gradient descent methods yield point estimates with no measure of confidence, which is acute in overparameterized and low-data regimes. Bootstrapping is a classical statistical framework for uncertainty estimation but is impractical for deep learning. Twin-Boot addresses these limitations by integrating uncertainty estimation into optimization.

Method: Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot) is a resampling-based training procedure that integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization. Two identical models are trained in parallel on independent bootstrap samples, and a periodic mean-reset keeps both trajectories in the same basin so that their divergence reflects local (within-basin) uncertainty. This estimate is used to sample weights in an adaptive, data-driven way, providing regularization that favors flatter solutions.

Result: The approach improves calibration and generalization and yields interpretable uncertainty maps.

Conclusion: Twin-Boot improves calibration and generalization and yields interpretable uncertainty maps in deep neural networks and complex high-dimensional inverse problems.

Abstract: Standard gradient descent methods yield point estimates with no measure of
confidence. This limitation is acute in overparameterized and low-data regimes,
where models have many parameters relative to available data and can easily
overfit. Bootstrapping is a classical statistical framework for uncertainty
estimation based on resampling, but naively applying it to deep learning is
impractical: it requires training many replicas, produces post-hoc estimates
that cannot guide learning, and implicitly assumes comparable optima across
runs - an assumption that fails in non-convex landscapes. We introduce
Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot), a resampling-based training

Abstract: With the growing size of deep neural networks and datasets, the computational
costs of training have significantly increased. The layer-freezing technique
has recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively
reduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing
methods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate
feature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs.
To overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches
feature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to
train directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be
straightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely
overlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations
to feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced. If these
overlooked challenges are not addressed, the performance of the caching method
will be severely impacted and even make it infeasible. This paper is the first
to comprehensively explore these challenges and provides a systematic solution.
To improve training accuracy, we propose \textit{similarity-aware channel
augmentation}, which caches channels with high augmentation sensitivity with a
minimum additional storage cost. To mitigate storage overhead, we incorporate
lossy data compression into layer freezing and design a \textit{progressive
compression} strategy, which increases compression rates as more layers are
frozen, effectively reducing storage costs. Finally, our solution achieves
significant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with
a minor time overhead. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
freezing and compression strategies, providing insights into optimizing their
application for efficient DNN training.

estimators typically assume uniform or worst-case corruption, ignoring
structural heterogeneity. For mean estimation for multivariate bounded
distributions and univariate gaussian distributions, we give tight minimax
rates for all heterogeneous corruption patterns. For multivariate gaussian mean
estimation and linear regression, we establish the minimax rate for squared
error up to a factor of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimension. Roughly, our
findings suggest that samples beyond a certain corruption threshold may be
discarded by the optimal estimators -- this threshold is determined by the
empirical distribution of the corruption rates given.

### [301] [Enhancing Optimizer Stability: Momentum Adaptation of The NGN Step-size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15071)
*Rustem Islamov,Niccolo Ajroldi,Antonio Orvieto,Aurelien Lucchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种名为 NGN-M 的新型优化算法，它结合了 NGN 步长方法和动量，在保持与现有最先进优化器相当的性能的同时，显著提高了算法对步长超参数选择的鲁棒性。该算法在较宽松的条件下达到了标准的收敛率，无需对梯度或迭代值进行有界假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代优化算法（如带动量和自适应步长的算法）在深度学习任务中表现优异，但其性能高度依赖于超参数（尤其是步长）的选择，这使得调优困难且耗时。因此，研究如何提高优化器在广泛超参数选择下的稳定性变得至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种动量版的 NGN 步长方法（NGN-M），通过新颖的 NGN 步长方法改进了优化器对步长超参数选择的稳定性。

Result: NGN-M 算法在较少限制的条件下，无需内插条件或有界随机梯度/迭代的假设，即可达到 $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ 的标准收敛率。与最先进的优化器相比，NGN-M 在性能上相当或更优，并且对步长超参数的选择更加鲁棒。

Conclusion: NGN-M 算法在较少限制的条件下，无需内插条件或有界随机梯度/迭代的假设，即可达到 $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ 的标准收敛率，并且在经验上证明了 NGN 步长与动量相结合可以提高对步长超参数选择的鲁棒性，同时提供与最先进优化器相当或更优的性能。

Abstract: Modern optimization algorithms that incorporate momentum and adaptive
step-size offer improved performance in numerous challenging deep learning
tasks. However, their effectiveness is often highly sensitive to the choice of
hyperparameters, especially the step-size. Tuning these parameters is often
difficult, resource-intensive, and time-consuming. Therefore, recent efforts
have been directed toward enhancing the stability of optimizers across a wide
range of hyperparameter choices [Schaipp et al., 2024]. In this paper, we
introduce an algorithm that matches the performance of state-of-the-art
optimizers while improving stability to the choice of the step-size
hyperparameter through a novel adaptation of the NGN step-size method [Orvieto
and Xiao, 2024]. Specifically, we propose a momentum-based version (NGN-M) that
attains the standard convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ under less
restrictive assumptions, without the need for interpolation condition or
assumptions of bounded stochastic gradients or iterates, in contrast to
previous approaches. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that the
combination of the NGN step-size with momentum results in enhanced robustness
to the choice of the step-size hyperparameter while delivering performance that
is comparable to or surpasses other state-of-the-art optimizers.

### [302] [Wormhole Dynamics in Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15086)
*Yen-Lung Lai,Zhe Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep neural networks can be fooled by random-looking inputs. This paper proposes a new analytical method to understand why, finding that networks sometimes learn "trivial" solutions. A "wormhole" solution is introduced to fix this, potentially improving how networks learn.

Method: We introduce an analytical framework based on maximum likelihood estimation, avoiding traditional gradient-based optimization and explicit labels.

Result: DNNs in an overparameterized regime exhibit output feature space collapse, which aids generalization. However, excessive layers lead to degeneracy where distinct inputs map to the same output, achieving zero loss. This degeneracy can be overcome with the proposed "wormhole" solution, which aligns meaningful and random labels for fooling examples, offering a new view on shortcut learning.

Abstract: This work investigates the generalization behavior of deep neural networks
(DNNs), focusing on the phenomenon of "fooling examples," where DNNs
confidently classify inputs that appear random or unstructured to humans. To
explore this phenomenon, we introduce an analytical framework based on maximum
likelihood estimation, without adhering to conventional numerical approaches
that rely on gradient-based optimization and explicit labels. Our analysis
reveals that DNNs operating in an overparameterized regime exhibit a collapse
in the output feature space. While this collapse improves network
generalization, adding more layers eventually leads to a state of degeneracy,
where the model learns trivial solutions by mapping distinct inputs to the same
output, resulting in zero loss. Further investigation demonstrates that this
degeneracy can be bypassed using our newly derived "wormhole" solution. The
wormhole solution, when applied to arbitrary fooling examples, reconciles
meaningful labels with random ones and provides a novel perspective on shortcut
learning. These findings offer deeper insights into DNN generalization and
highlight directions for future research on learning dynamics in unsupervised
settings to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

*Moghis Fereidouni,Muhammad Umair Haider,Peizhong Ju,A. B. Siddique*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究首次量化评估了稀疏自编码器（SAEs）在解决大型语言模型（LLMs）多义性问题上的效果。研究发现 SAEs 确实降低了多义性并提高了概念可分离性，但过度稀疏可能损害模型性能。SAEs 在进行概念级干预时，尤其是在部分抑制策略下，能实现更精确的控制。新提出的 APP 方法在有针对性的概念移除任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究的主要动机是解决解释大型语言模型（LLMs）中的多义性问题，即神经元激活与多个不相关概念相关联。虽然稀疏自编码器（SAEs）被提出用于缓解此问题，但之前缺乏对其单义性提升效果的量化评估。

Method: 本研究首次对 SAEs 与基线模型在单义性方面的性能进行了系统性评估。研究引入了一种基于 Jensen-Shannon 距离的细粒度概念可分离性分数，并使用 Gemma-2-2B 和多种 SAEs 变体在五个基准测试上进行了评估。此外，研究还评估了两种概念级干预策略：神经元完全掩蔽和部分抑制。

Result: 研究表明，SAEs 能够降低多义性并提高概念可分离性。然而，SAEs 的稀疏性程度与其可分离性之间并非严格正相关，并且过度稀疏可能损害下游任务性能。在概念级干预方面，SAEs 在部分抑制策略下能实现比基线模型更精确的概念控制。新提出的 APP 方法通过使用条件激活分布进行目标抑制，在移除特定概念方面表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SAEs 能够减少多义性并提高概念可分离性，但更高的稀疏性并不总能带来更好的可分离性，并且会损害下游性能。SAEs 能够实现比基线模型更精确的概念级控制，并且 APP 作为一种新的干预方法，在有针对性的概念移除方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: A key barrier to interpreting large language models is polysemanticity, where
neurons activate for multiple unrelated concepts. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
have been proposed to mitigate this issue by transforming dense activations
into sparse, more interpretable features. While prior work suggests that SAEs
promote monosemanticity, there has been no quantitative comparison with their
base models. This paper provides the first systematic evaluation of SAEs
against base models concerning monosemanticity. We introduce a fine-grained
concept separability score based on the Jensen-Shannon distance, which captures
how distinctly a neuron's activation distributions vary across concepts. Using
Gemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks, we show that SAEs
reduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability. However,
greater sparsity of SAEs does not always yield better separability and often
impairs downstream performance. To assess practical utility, we evaluate
concept-level interventions using two strategies: full neuron masking and
partial suppression. We find that, compared to base models, SAEs enable more
precise concept-level control when using partial suppression. Building on this,
we propose Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP), a new intervention
method that uses concept-conditioned activation distributions for targeted
suppression. APP outperforms existing approaches in targeted concept removal.

*Siddharth Chaudhary,Bennett Browning*

TL;DR: Hydra 是一种旨在实现高效长上下文处理的混合语言模型架构，它结合了 SSM、稀疏注意力和 MoE 等技术，但仍需在实际应用中进行验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出了一种结合条件计算、长上下文内存机制和稀疏专家混合的混合长上下文语言模型架构。

Method: Hydra 结合了 Mamba 风格的结构化状态空间模型 (SSM) 主干、间歇性稀疏全局注意力、块级 MoE 前馈路由以及双记忆（工作区加事实 PKM）。

Result: Hydra 是一个约 1.6B 参数的设计，展示了实现可行性和定性扩展行为，但并未声称具有竞争性的全面性能。

Conclusion: Hydra 是一个有前途的蓝图，旨在实现模块化、输入自适应的长上下文语言模型，但其最终任务收益仍有待在目标规模上进行验证。

Abstract: We present Hydra as an architectural proposal for hybrid long-context
language models that combine conditional computation, long-context memory
mechanisms, and sparse mixture-of-experts within an approximately 1.6B
parameter design envelope. Hydra integrates a Mamba-style Structured State
Space Model (SSM) backbone with intermittent sparse global attention,
chunk-level MoE feed-forward routing, and dual (workspace plus factual PKM)
memories. We formalize the component interfaces, give transparent parameter and
complexity accounting, and outline a staged curriculum intended to stably
activate the parts. We accompany the specification with illustrative toy-scale
prototype measurements (tens of millions of parameters on synthetic data) whose
sole purpose is to demonstrate implementation feasibility and qualitative
scaling behaviors (for example, long-context throughput crossover and
controllable expert routing), not to claim competitive full-scale performance.
We explicitly delineate assumptions and open risks (training complexity, memory
utilization, specialization dynamics) and position Hydra as a blueprint to
stimulate empirical follow-up rather than a finished system. By combining SSM
efficiency, selective sparse attention, MoE capacity, and learnable memory,
Hydra sketches a path toward modular, input-adaptive long-context language
models; validating end-task gains at target scale remains future work.

Motivation: 文本到图像（T2I）生成模型引发了对隐私、版权和安全的担忧，促使了概念擦除技术（CET）的发展。然而，现有的 CET 可能被规避并产生副作用，因此需要对其鲁棒性进行全面评估。

Method: 本研究提出 Side Effect Evaluation (SEE) 评估基准，包含层次化和组合型提示，用于量化 CET 的副作用，具体评估三个方面：对邻近概念的影响、目标规避能力和属性泄露情况。通过实验验证了 CET 的鲁棒性和潜在的副作用。

Result: CET 容易被利用超类-子类层次结构和语义相似提示（例如目标的组合变体）来规避。CET 还存在属性泄露问题，并可能导致注意力集中或分散的违反直觉的现象。

Conclusion: 现有的概念擦除技术（CET）容易被规避，并且会产生副作用。本研究提出了一个名为 Side Effect Evaluation (SEE) 的评估基准，以系统地衡量 CET 的鲁棒性，并量化其副作用，包括对邻近概念的影响、目标规避以及属性泄露。研究结果表明，CET 容易被利用超类-子类层次结构和语义相似提示（例如目标的组合变体）来规避，并且存在属性泄露以及注意力集中或分散的违反直觉的现象。研究发布了数据集、代码和评估工具，以促进未来在鲁棒概念擦除方面的研究。

Abstract: Concerns about text-to-image (T2I) generative models infringing on privacy,
copyright, and safety have led to the development of Concept Erasure Techniques
(CETs).
  The goal of an effective CET is to prohibit the generation of undesired
``target'' concepts specified by the user, while preserving the ability to
synthesize high-quality images of the remaining concepts.
  In this work, we demonstrate that CETs can be easily circumvented and present
several side effects of concept erasure.
  For a comprehensive measurement of the robustness of CETs, we present Side
Effect Evaluation (\see), an evaluation benchmark that consists of hierarchical
and compositional prompts that describe objects and their attributes.
  This dataset and our automated evaluation pipeline quantify side effects of
CETs across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets,
and attribute leakage.
  Our experiments reveal that CETs can be circumvented by using
superclass-subclass hierarchy and semantically similar prompts, such as
compositional variants of the target. We show that CETs suffer from attribute
leakage and counterintuitive phenomena of attention concentration or dispersal.
  We release our dataset, code, and evaluation tools to aid future work on
robust concept erasure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习的普及和数据隐私法规的演变，从训练模型中去除私人或受版权保护的信息变得越来越重要。现有的方法通常需要访问整个训练数据集，这在实际中可能无法实现。

Method: 提出了一种能够估计未知剩余训练数据的Hessian的方法，并利用该估计技术实现了高效的零次学习。

Result: 该方法能够在不访问原始训练数据集的情况下，有效地从训练模型中移除特定数据，同时在剩余数据上保持性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在广泛的数据集上进行了广泛的实验，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: As machine learning becomes more pervasive and data privacy regulations
evolve, the ability to remove private or copyrighted information from trained
models is becoming an increasingly critical requirement. Existing unlearning
methods often rely on the assumption of having access to the entire training
dataset during the forgetting process. However, this assumption may not hold
true in practical scenarios where the original training data may not be
accessible, i.e., the source-free setting. To address this challenge, we focus
on the source-free unlearning scenario, where an unlearning algorithm must be
capable of removing specific data from a trained model without requiring access
to the original training dataset. Building on recent work, we present a method
that can estimate the Hessian of the unknown remaining training data, a crucial
component required for efficient unlearning. Leveraging this estimation
technique, our method enables efficient zero-shot unlearning while providing
robust theoretical guarantees on the unlearning performance, while maintaining
performance on the remaining data. Extensive experiments over a wide range of
datasets verify the efficacy of our method.

*Sridhar Mahadevan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Universal Reinforcement Learning (URL), a categorial generalization of RL that uses advanced mathematical concepts like coinduction and topos theory to model algorithms and dynamical systems. URL generalizes the process of finding fixed points in RL to asynchronously determining the final coalgebra, offering a new perspective on RL research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a categorial generalization of RL (Universal Reinforcement Learning - URL) by leveraging mathematical abstractions from coinduction, universal coalgebras, topos theory, and categorial models of asynchronous parallel distributed computation.

Method: This paper reviews the basic RL framework, illustrates the use of categories and functors in RL, introduces a standard model of asynchronous distributed minimization, and describes the relationship between metric coinduction and the Asynchronous Convergence Theorem. It then models the space of algorithms for MDPs or PSRs as a functor category within a topos and describes a broad family of universal coalgebras extending previous RL dynamic system models.

Result: The paper demonstrates that various dynamical system models in RL (MDPs, POMDPs, PSRs, LDSs) are special types of coalgebras and generalizes the fixed-point finding problem in RL to determining the final coalgebra asynchronously in a parallel distributed manner.

Conclusion: URL provides a categorial generalization of RL, extending existing dynamic system models and generalizing the core problem of finding fixed points in RL to determining the final coalgebra asynchronously in a parallel distributed manner.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a categorial generalization of RL, termed
universal reinforcement learning (URL), building on powerful mathematical
abstractions from the study of coinduction on non-well-founded sets and
universal coalgebras, topos theory, and categorial models of asynchronous
parallel distributed computation. In the first half of the paper, we review the
basic RL framework, illustrate the use of categories and functors in RL,
showing how they lead to interesting insights. In particular, we also introduce
a standard model of asynchronous distributed minimization proposed by Bertsekas
and Tsitsiklis, and describe the relationship between metric coinduction and
their proof of the Asynchronous Convergence Theorem. The space of algorithms
for MDPs or PSRs can be modeled as a functor category, where the co-domain
category forms a topos, which admits all (co)limits, possesses a subobject
classifier, and has exponential objects. In the second half of the paper, we
move on to universal coalgebras. Dynamical system models, such as Markov
decision processes (MDPs), partially observed MDPs (POMDPs), a predictive state
representation (PSRs), and linear dynamical systems (LDSs) are all special
types of coalgebras. We describe a broad family of universal coalgebras,
extending the dynamic system models studied previously in RL. The core problem
in finding fixed points in RL to determine the exact or approximate (action)
value function is generalized in URL to determining the final coalgebra
asynchronously in a parallel distributed manner.

Abstract: There is a flurry of recent research papers proposing novel differentially
private machine learning (DPML) techniques. These papers claim to achieve new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) results and offer empirical results as validation.
However, there is no consensus on which techniques are most effective or if
they genuinely meet their stated claims. Complicating matters, heterogeneity in
codebases, datasets, methodologies, and model architectures make direct
comparisons of different approaches challenging.
  In this paper, we conduct a reproducibility and replicability (R+R)
experiment on 11 different SoTA DPML techniques from the recent research
literature. Results of our investigation are varied: while some methods stand
up to scrutiny, others falter when tested outside their initial experimental
conditions. We also discuss challenges unique to the reproducibility of DPML,
including additional randomness due to DP noise, and how to address them.
Finally, we derive insights and best practices to obtain scientifically valid

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SafeLLM是一种创新的防御框架，通过“遗忘”大型语言模型中的有害知识来抵御越狱攻击，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越狱攻击通过构造对抗性提示绕过大型语言模型的对齐机制，导致模型产生有害、受限或有偏见的内容，对模型的安全性构成严重威胁。因此，需要一种能够有效防御此类攻击并保持模型性能的方法。

Method: SafeLLM框架包含三个阶段：1. 使用混合方法（外部分类器和模型内部评估）进行动态不安全输出检测；2. 通过前馈网络（FFN）激活追踪令牌级有害内容，以定位有害知识；3. 通过约束优化来抑制不安全行为，同时不损害模型的整体质量。

Result: SafeLLM在Vicuna、LLaMA和GPT-J等大型语言模型以及多个越狱基准测试中，显著降低了攻击成功率，同时保持了较高的通用性能。与监督微调和直接偏好优化等标准防御方法相比，SafeLLM提供了更强的安全保证、对有害行为更精确的控制以及对未见攻击的更强鲁棒性。此外，SafeLLM在遗忘有害知识后能保持通用性能。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了SafeLLM，一种基于知识遗忘的防御框架，用于减轻大型语言模型的越狱攻击，同时保持其语言流畅性和通用能力。SafeLLM通过动态不安全输出检测、基于前馈网络（FFN）激活的令牌级有害内容追踪，以及约束优化来实现对有害知识的针对性遗忘。实验证明，SafeLLM在安全性、控制精度和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法，并且在遗忘有害知识的同时不损害模型性能。研究结果表明，知识遗忘是提高LLM安全性的一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose a serious threat to the safety of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by crafting adversarial prompts that bypass alignment mechanisms,
causing the models to produce harmful, restricted, or biased content. In this
paper, we propose SafeLLM, a novel unlearning-based defense framework that
unlearn the harmful knowledge from LLMs while preserving linguistic fluency and
general capabilities. SafeLLM employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic
unsafe output detection using a hybrid approach that integrates external
classifiers with model-internal evaluations; (2) token-level harmful content
tracing through feedforward network (FFN) activations to localize harmful
knowledge; and (3) constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior without
degrading overall model quality. SafeLLM achieves targeted and irreversible
forgetting by identifying and neutralizing FFN substructures responsible for
harmful generation pathways. Extensive experiments on prominent LLMs (Vicuna,
LLaMA, and GPT-J) across multiple jailbreak benchmarks show that SafeLLM
substantially reduces attack success rates while maintaining high
general-purpose performance. Compared to standard defense methods such as
supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization, SafeLLM offers
stronger safety guarantees, more precise control over harmful behavior, and
greater robustness to unseen attacks. Moreover, SafeLLM maintains the general
performance after the harmful knowledge unlearned. These results highlight
unlearning as a promising direction for scalable and effective LLM safety.

Motivation: 解决机器学习高风险决策中算法公平性问题，并指出预处理方法（数据层面）相较于另外两种方法（模型训练中和模型训练后）受到的关注较少，缺乏标准化的评估工具。

Conclusion: FairPrep是一个用于评估表格数据集上公平性感知预处理技术的框架，它填补了公平性基准测试领域的关键空白，并为推进数据级公平性研究提供了实际基础。

Abstract: As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into high-stakes
decision-making processes, ensuring fairness in algorithmic outcomes has become
a critical concern. Methods to mitigate bias typically fall into three
categories: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. While
significant attention has been devoted to the latter two, pre-processing
methods, which operate at the data level and offer advantages such as
model-agnosticism and improved privacy compliance, have received comparatively
less focus and lack standardised evaluation tools. In this work, we introduce
FairPrep, an extensible and modular benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
fairness-aware pre-processing techniques on tabular datasets. Built on the
AIF360 platform, FairPrep allows seamless integration of datasets, fairness
interventions, and predictive models. It features a batch-processing interface
that enables efficient experimentation and automatic reporting of fairness and
utility metrics. By offering standardised pipelines and supporting reproducible
evaluations, FairPrep fills a critical gap in the fairness benchmarking
landscape and provides a practical foundation for advancing data-level fairness
research.

Method: 通过傅立叶分析TNNs的训练动力学，并结合随机傅立叶特征来增强其在多尺度问题上的表达能力。此外，利用张量结构，通过对一维分量函数执行离散傅立叶变换来提取高维函数频率特征，从而缓解维度灾难。

Result: 通过大量的数值实验验证了所提出的频域自适应张量神经网络算法的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的频域自适应张量神经网络算法能有效缓解维度灾难，并显著提升了TNNs解决复杂多尺度问题的能力。

Abstract: Tensor neural networks (TNNs) have demonstrated their superiority in solving
high-dimensional problems. However, similar to conventional neural networks,
TNNs are also influenced by the Frequency Principle, which limits their ability
to accurately capture high-frequency features of the solution. In this work, we
analyze the training dynamics of TNNs by Fourier analysis and enhance their
expressivity for high-dimensional multi-scale problems by incorporating random
Fourier features. Leveraging the inherent tensor structure of TNNs, we further
propose a novel approach to extract frequency features of high-dimensional
functions by performing the Discrete Fourier Transform to one-dimensional
component functions. This strategy effectively mitigates the curse of
dimensionality. Building on this idea, we propose a frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm, which significantly improves the ability of TNNs in solving complex
multi-scale problems. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to validate
the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm.

Abstract: Classification of sleep stages is essential for assessing sleep quality and
diagnosing sleep disorders such as insomnia. However, manual inspection of EEG
characteristics for each stage is time-consuming and prone to human error.
Although machine learning and deep learning methods have been actively
developed, they continue to face challenges from the non-stationarity and
variability of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG)
signals, often leading to poor generalization on unseen datasets. This research
proposed a Sleep Stage Classification method by developing Multivariate
Differential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) for joint EEG and EOG representation
learning. Specifically, SleepDIFFormer was developed to process EEG and EOG
signals using our Multivariate Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) for
time series, trained with cross-domain alignment. Our method mitigated spatial
and temporal attention noise while learning a domain-invariant joint EEG-EOG
representation through feature distribution alignment, thereby enabling
generalization to unseen target datasets. Empirically, we evaluated our method
on five different sleep staging datasets and compared it with existing
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted thorough
ablation analyses of SleepDIFFormer and interpreted the differential attention
weights, highlighting their relevance to characteristic sleep EEG patterns.
These findings have implications for advancing automated sleep stage
classification and its application to sleep quality assessment. Our source code

TL;DR: MAL框架通过整合多种归因信号来提升CVR预测效果，并兼容工业部署需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CVR预测模型通常只使用单一归因机制的标签进行训练，忽略了其他归因视角下的互补信号，限制了模型性能。MAL框架旨在整合来自多个归因视角的信息，以更好地捕捉驱动用户转化的潜在模式。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的多归因学习（MAL）框架，包含归因知识聚合器（AKA）和主要目标预测器（PTP）。AKA作为多任务学习器整合来自不同归因标签的知识。PTP则专注于生成与系统优化归因指标（如点击归因下的CVR）相符的校准转化概率。此外，还提出了CAT训练策略，利用所有归因标签组合的笛卡尔积来生成增强的监督信号。

Result: MAL框架在CVR预测方面优于单一归因学习基线，在离线指标上实现了+0.51%的GAUC提升。在线实验表明MAL的投资回报率（ROI）提高了+2.6%。

Conclusion: MAL框架在CVR预测方面优于单一归因学习基线，在离线指标上实现了+0.51%的GAUC提升，在线实验表明MAL的投资回报率（ROI）提高了+2.6%。

Abstract: Conversion rate (CVR) prediction is a core component of online advertising
systems, where the attribution mechanisms-rules for allocating conversion
credit across user touchpoints-fundamentally determine label generation and
model optimization. While many industrial platforms support diverse attribution
mechanisms (e.g., First-Click, Last-Click, Linear, and Data-Driven Multi-Touch
Attribution), conventional approaches restrict model training to labels from a
single production-critical attribution mechanism, discarding complementary
signals in alternative attribution perspectives.
  To address this limitation, we propose a novel Multi-Attribution Learning
(MAL) framework for CVR prediction that integrates signals from multiple
attribution perspectives to better capture the underlying patterns driving user
conversions. Specifically, MAL is a joint learning framework consisting of two
core components: the Attribution Knowledge Aggregator (AKA) and the Primary
Target Predictor (PTP). AKA is implemented as a multi-task learner that
integrates knowledge extracted from diverse attribution labels. PTP, in
contrast, focuses on the task of generating well-calibrated conversion
probabilities that align with the system-optimized attribution metric (e.g.,
CVR under the Last-Click attribution), ensuring direct compatibility with
industrial deployment requirements. Additionally, we propose CAT, a novel
training strategy that leverages the Cartesian product of all attribution label
combinations to generate enriched supervision signals. This design
substantially enhances the performance of the attribution knowledge aggregator.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of MAL over
single-attribution learning baselines, achieving +0.51% GAUC improvement on
offline metrics. Online experiments demonstrate that MAL achieved a +2.6%
increase in ROI (Return on Investment).

Motivation: 现有的LLM测试时间扩展方法（如自洽性）存在准确性收益递减和高计算开销的问题。DeepConf旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: DeepConf通过利用模型内部的置信信号来动态过滤低质量的推理轨迹，以提高推理效率和性能。

Result: 在AIME 2025等具有挑战性的基准测试中，DeepConf@512实现了高达99.9%的准确率，并将生成的令牌减少了高达84.7%。

Conclusion: DeepConf是一种简单而强大的方法，可以在测试时提高推理效率和性能，通过利用模型内部的置信信号动态过滤低质量的推理轨迹，无需额外的模型训练或超参数调整，并且可以无缝集成到现有的服务框架中。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling methods like self-consistency with majority voting.
However, this approach often leads to diminishing returns in accuracy and high
computational overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce Deep Think
with Confidence (DeepConf), a simple yet powerful method that enhances both
reasoning efficiency and performance at test time. DeepConf leverages
model-internal confidence signals to dynamically filter out low-quality
reasoning traces during or after generation. It requires no additional model
training or hyperparameter tuning and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing serving frameworks. We evaluate DeepConf across a variety of reasoning
tasks and the latest open-source models, including Qwen 3 and GPT-OSS series.
Notably, on challenging benchmarks such as AIME 2025, DeepConf@512 achieves up
to 99.9% accuracy and reduces generated tokens by up to 84.7% compared to full

TL;DR: 本文评估了CSG度量在知识图谱链接预测任务中的表现，并提出了一系列新的度量方法，发现它们比CSG更能准确地反映任务难度。


<details>

Motivation: 理解数据集复杂度对于评估和比较知识图谱（KGs）上的链接预测模型至关重要。尽管已提出CSG度量，但其在KG场景下的表现尚未得到评估。

Method: 本文批判性地研究了CSG在多关系链接预测中的应用，并通过transformer引入了语义表示。此外，本文还引入并评估了一系列结构和语义KG复杂度度量。

Result: 研究发现CSG对参数化高度敏感，并且不能随着类别数量的增加而稳健地扩展。此外，它与MRR和Hit@1等标准性能指标的相关性较弱或不一致。相比之下，关系熵、节点级别最大关系多样性和关系类型基数等度量与MRR和Hit@1呈强烈的负相关。图连通性度量（如平均度、度熵、PageRank和特征向量中心性）与Hit@10呈正相关。

Conclusion: CSG在链接预测场景下其稳定性和泛化预测能力均未能得到验证，并且揭示了在知识驱动学习中需要更稳定、可解释和与任务一致的数据集复杂度度量的必要性。

Abstract: Understanding dataset complexity is fundamental to evaluating and comparing
link prediction models on knowledge graphs (KGs). While the Cumulative Spectral
Gradient (CSG) metric, derived from probabilistic divergence between classes
within a spectral clustering framework, has been proposed as a classifier
agnostic complexity metric purportedly scaling with class cardinality and
correlating with downstream performance, it has not been evaluated in KG
settings so far. In this work, we critically examine CSG in the context of
multi relational link prediction, incorporating semantic representations via
transformer derived embeddings. Contrary to prior claims, we find that CSG is
highly sensitive to parametrisation and does not robustly scale with the number
of classes. Moreover, it exhibits weak or inconsistent correlation with
standard performance metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@1. To
deepen the analysis, we introduce and benchmark a set of structural and
semantic KG complexity metrics. Our findings reveal that global and local
relational ambiguity captured via Relation Entropy, node level Maximum Relation
Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality exhibit strong inverse correlations
with MRR and Hit@1, suggesting these as more faithful indicators of task
difficulty. Conversely, graph connectivity measures such as Average Degree,
Degree Entropy, PageRank, and Eigenvector Centrality correlate positively with
Hit@10. Our results demonstrate that CSGs purported stability and
generalization predictive power fail to hold in link prediction settings and
underscore the need for more stable, interpretable, and task-aligned measures
of dataset complexity in knowledge driven learning.

Abstract: Generalization remains a significant challenge in visual classification
tasks, particularly in handling unknown classes in real-world applications.
Existing research focuses on the class discovery paradigm, which tends to favor
known classes, and the incremental learning paradigm, which suffers from
catastrophic forgetting. Recent approaches such as the L-Reg technique employ
logic-based regularization to enhance generalization but are bound by the
necessity of fully defined logical formulas, limiting flexibility for unknown
classes. This paper introduces PL-Reg, a novel partial-logic regularization
term that allows models to reserve space for undefined logic formulas,
improving adaptability to unknown classes. Specifically, we formally
demonstrate that tasks involving unknown classes can be effectively explained
using partial logic. We also prove that methods based on partial logic lead to
improved generalization. We validate PL-Reg through extensive experiments on
Generalized Category Discovery, Multi-Domain Generalized Category Discovery,
and long-tailed Class Incremental Learning tasks, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements. Our results highlight the effectiveness of partial
logic in tackling challenges related to unknown classes.

*Abdelmoula El-Yazizi,Yaroslav Koshka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: D-Wave量子退火器在RBM训练方面未能带来显著改进，但其在缓解灾难性遗忘方面的潜力值得关注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解释以及可能解决在先前研究中，当使用D-Wave进行采样时，RBM可训练性没有显著且持续改进的原因，即探索D-Wave量子退火器（QA）和经典马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛（MCMC）在采样性能上的微小统计差异。

Method: 通过比较D-Wave量子退火器（QA）和经典马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛（MCMC）在受限玻尔兹曼机（RBMs）上的采样性能，并提出了一种结合两者的混合采样方法来探索改进RBM训练的可能性。此外，研究还探索了使用QA生成的样本来缓解灾难性遗忘（CF）的可行性。

Result: 在RBM训练方面没有取得任何改进，这表明QA采样和MCMC采样之间的差异（主要存在于分布的中低概率区域，而这些区域对样本质量不太重要）不足以使训练受益。此外，将RBM嵌入到新一代D-Wave硬件的晶格中以获得足够高的质量也存在困难。然而，QA在生成具有足够多样性的样本（尤其是在较低概率部分）的能力方面，显示出在缓解灾难性遗忘（CF）等其他机器学习应用中的潜力，并且首次证明了其可行性，其效率与经典方法相当，并且在生成大量不同但理想的模式的速度和未来改进潜力方面都显示出前景。

Conclusion: 研究表明，D-Wave量子退火器（QA）和经典马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛（MCMC）在采样性能上的微小统计差异，对于改进受限玻尔兹曼机（RBM）的可训练性来说是不够的。然而，QA生成的样本的多样性，尤其是在较低概率区域，在缓解灾难性遗忘（CF）方面显示出潜力，并且效果与经典方法相当，该方法具有进一步改进的潜力。

Abstract: Modest statistical differences between the sampling performances of the
D-Wave quantum annealer (QA) and the classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),
when applied to Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), are explored to explain,
and possibly address, the absence of significant and consistent improvements in
RBM trainability when the D-Wave sampling was used in previous investigations.
A novel hybrid sampling approach, combining the classical and the QA
contributions, is investigated as a promising way to benefit from the modest
differences between the two sampling methods. No improvements in the RBM
training are achieved in this work, thereby suggesting that the differences
between the QA-based and MCMC sampling, mainly found in the medium-to-low
probability regions of the distribution, which are less important for the
quality of the sample, are insufficient to benefit the training. Difficulties
in achieving sufficiently high quality of embedding RBMs into the lattice of
the newer generation of D-Wave hardware could be further complicating the task.
On the other hand, the ability to generate samples of sufficient variety from
lower-probability parts of the distribution has a potential to benefit other
machine learning applications, such as the mitigation of catastrophic
forgetting (CF) during incremental learning. The feasibility of using
QA-generated patterns of desirable classes for CF mitigation by the generative
replay is demonstrated in this work for the first time. While the efficiency of
the CF mitigation using the D-Wave QA was comparable to that of the classical
mitigation, both the speed of generating a large number of distinct desirable
patterns and the potential for further improvement make this approach promising
for a variety of challenging machine learning applications.

TL;DR: ExBigBang is a new AI model that improves user persona classification by combining text and data, making it more accurate and understandable by incorporating user information and context. It also explains its reasoning, addressing limitations in previous models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing persona development methods in user-centric design, which struggle with the complexity of user interactions and often lack explainability. The study aims to provide a more contextualized approach by integrating textual and tabular data and enhancing model interpretability.

Method: ExBigBang utilizes a hybrid text-tabular approach with transformer-based architectures to model contextual features for persona classification. It incorporates metadata, domain knowledge, and user profiling, and dynamically updates through a cyclical process of user profiling and classification.

Result: Experiments on a benchmark persona classification dataset demonstrate the robustness of the ExBigBang model. An ablation study confirms the benefits of combining text and tabular data, and Explainable AI techniques provide insights into the model's prediction rationale.

Conclusion: The study presents ExBigBang, a hybrid text-tabular approach using transformer-based architectures for persona classification, which effectively models contextual features by integrating metadata, domain knowledge, and user profiling. The model's dynamic updating mechanism reflects evolving user behaviors and its robustness is demonstrated through experiments and ablation studies. Explainable AI techniques further enhance the model's interpretability.

Abstract: In user-centric design, persona development plays a vital role in
understanding user behaviour, capturing needs, segmenting audiences, and
guiding design decisions. However, the growing complexity of user interactions
calls for a more contextualized approach to ensure designs align with real user
needs. While earlier studies have advanced persona classification by modelling
user behaviour, capturing contextual information, especially by integrating
textual and tabular data, remains a key challenge. These models also often lack
explainability, leaving their predictions difficult to interpret or justify. To
address these limitations, we present ExBigBang (Explainable BigBang), a hybrid
text-tabular approach that uses transformer-based architectures to model rich
contextual features for persona classification. ExBigBang incorporates
metadata, domain knowledge, and user profiling to embed deeper context into
predictions. Through a cyclical process of user profiling and classification,
our approach dynamically updates to reflect evolving user behaviours.
Experiments on a benchmark persona classification dataset demonstrate the
robustness of our model. An ablation study confirms the benefits of combining
text and tabular data, while Explainable AI techniques shed light on the
rationale behind the model's predictions.

Abstract: Machine learning models often preserve biases present in training data,
leading to unfair treatment of certain minority groups. Despite an array of
existing firm-side bias mitigation techniques, they typically incur utility
costs and require organizational buy-in. Recognizing that many models rely on
user-contributed data, end-users can induce fairness through the framework of
Algorithmic Collective Action, where a coordinated minority group strategically
relabels its own data to enhance fairness, without altering the firm's training
process. We propose three practical, model-agnostic methods to approximate
ideal relabeling and validate them on real-world datasets. Our findings show
that a subgroup of the minority can substantially reduce unfairness with a
small impact on the overall prediction error.

Abstract: Dynamic graph-level embedding aims to capture structural evolution in
networks, which is essential for modeling real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods face two critical yet under-explored issues: Structural Visit
Bias, where random walk sampling disproportionately emphasizes high-degree
nodes, leading to redundant and noisy structural representations; and Abrupt
Evolution Blindness, the failure to effectively detect sudden structural
changes due to rigid or overly simplistic temporal modeling strategies,
resulting in inconsistent temporal embeddings. To overcome these challenges, we
propose EvoFormer, an evolution-aware Transformer framework tailored for
dynamic graph-level representation learning. To mitigate Structural Visit Bias,
EvoFormer introduces a Structure-Aware Transformer Module that incorporates
positional encoding based on node structural roles, allowing the model to
globally differentiate and accurately represent node structures. To overcome
Abrupt Evolution Blindness, EvoFormer employs an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal
Module, which explicitly models temporal evolution through a sequential
three-step strategy: (I) Random Walk Timestamp Classification, generating
initial timestamp-aware graph-level embeddings; (II) Graph-Level Temporal
Segmentation, partitioning the graph stream into segments reflecting
structurally coherent periods; and (III) Segment-Aware Temporal Self-Attention
combined with an Edge Evolution Prediction task, enabling the model to
precisely capture segment boundaries and perceive structural evolution trends,
effectively adapting to rapid temporal shifts. Extensive evaluations on five
benchmark datasets confirm that EvoFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance
in graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal
segmentation tasks, validating its effectiveness in correcting structural and
temporal biases.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs(TAGs) are pervasive in real-world systems,where each
node carries its own textual features. In many cases these graphs are
inherently heterogeneous, containing multiple node types and diverse edge
types. Despite the ubiquity of such heterogeneous TAGs, there remains a lack of
large-scale benchmark datasets. This shortage has become a critical bottleneck,
hindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning
methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce
CITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest
heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials.
CITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types. In
addition, we establish standardized evaluation procedures and conduct extensive
benchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments
on the heterogeneous and textual properties of CITE. We compare four classes of
learning paradigms, including homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph
models, LLM(Large Language Model)-centric models, and LLM+Graph models. In a
nutshell, we provide (i) an overview of the CITE dataset, (ii) standardized
evaluation protocols, and (iii) baseline and ablation experiments across

Abstract: In this study, we present an Evolving Fuzzy System within the context of
Federated Learning, which adapts dynamically with the addition of new clusters
and therefore does not require the number of clusters to be selected apriori.
Unlike traditional methods, Federated Learning allows models to be trained
locally on clients' devices, sharing only the model parameters with a central

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable devices has advanced
significantly in recent years, yet its generalization remains limited when
models are deployed to new users. This degradation in performance is primarily
due to user-induced concept drift (UICD), highlighting the importance of
efficient personalization. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework that
first generalizes across users and then rapidly adapts to individual users
using few-shot learning directly on-device. By updating only the classifier
layer with user-specific data, our method achieves robust personalization with
minimal computational and memory overhead. We implement this framework on the
energy-efficient RISC-V-based GAP9 microcontroller and validate it across three
diverse HAR scenarios: RecGym, QVAR-Gesture, and Ultrasound-Gesture.
Post-deployment adaptation yields consistent accuracy improvements of 3.73\%,
17.38\%, and 3.70\% respectively. These results confirm that fast, lightweight,
and effective personalization is feasible on embedded platforms, paving the way
for scalable and user-aware HAR systems in the wild

Result: 与现有方法相比，该方法速度更快，并且可以检测重叠的簇，同时避免合并正交的簇。

Conclusion: 我们的方法比比较的方法快几倍，并且能够检测重叠的簇，同时避免合并正交的簇。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new measure for detecting overlap in multivariate
Gaussian clusters. The aim of online learning from data streams is to create
clustering, classification, or regression models that can adapt over time based
on the conceptual drift of streaming data. In the case of clustering, this can
result in a large number of clusters that may overlap and should be merged.
Commonly used distribution dissimilarity measures are not adequate for
determining overlapping clusters in the context of online learning from
streaming data due to their inability to account for all shapes of clusters and
their high computational demands. Our proposed dissimilarity measure is
specifically designed to detect overlap rather than dissimilarity and can be
computed faster compared to existing measures. Our method is several times
faster than compared methods and is capable of detecting overlapping clusters
while avoiding the merging of orthogonal clusters.

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现有效的连续遗忘，并成功防御重学习攻击，在遗忘有效性方面达到了最先进的性能，同时保留了自然性能。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in various domains and tasks, concerns about their safety are becoming
increasingly severe. In particular, since models may store unsafe knowledge
internally, machine unlearning has emerged as a representative paradigm to
ensure model safety. Existing approaches employ various training techniques,
such as gradient ascent and negative preference optimization, in attempts to
eliminate the influence of undesired data on target models. However, these
methods merely suppress the activation of undesired data through parametric
training without completely eradicating its informational traces within the
model. This fundamental limitation makes it difficult to achieve effective
continuous unlearning, rendering these methods vulnerable to relearning
attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Metamorphosis
Representation Projection (MRP) approach that pioneers the application of
irreversible projection properties to machine unlearning. By implementing
projective transformations in the hidden state space of specific network
layers, our method effectively eliminates harmful information while preserving
useful knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables
effective continuous unlearning and successfully defends against relearning
attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness
while preserving natural performance. Our code is available in

TL;DR: HypSeek 是一个创新的双曲表示学习框架，通过利用双曲几何的优势，显著提高了蛋白质-配体结合预测的准确性，特别是在处理活性悬崖等复杂情况时，它统一了虚拟筛选和亲和力排序任务，并在多个基准测试中取得了优越的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于检索的方法将配体和蛋白质口袋嵌入欧几里得空间进行相似性搜索，但欧几里得嵌入的几何结构往往无法捕捉分子相互作用固有的层级结构和细粒度亲和力变化。

Method: 提出了一种名为 HypSeek 的双曲表示学习框架，将配体、蛋白质口袋和序列嵌入洛伦兹模型双曲空间。

Result: HypSeek 在 DUD-E 上的虚拟筛选早期富集率从 42.63% 提高到 51.44%（+20.7%），在 JACS 上的亲和力排序相关性从 0.5774 提高到 0.7239（+25.4%），证明了双曲几何在两个任务中的优势，并突显了其作为蛋白质-配体建模的强大归纳偏置的潜力。

Conclusion: HypSeek 通过将配体、蛋白质口袋和序列嵌入洛伦兹模型双曲空间，利用双曲空间的指数几何和负曲率，实现有效的、对亲和力敏感的嵌入，能够有效地模拟全局活性和细微的功能差异，尤其是在具有挑战性的活性悬崖案例中。该模型将虚拟筛选和亲和力排序统一在单一框架内，并引入了蛋白质引导的三塔架构来增强表征结构。

Abstract: Protein-ligand binding prediction is central to virtual screening and
affinity ranking, two fundamental tasks in drug discovery. While recent
retrieval-based methods embed ligands and protein pockets into Euclidean space
for similarity-based search, the geometry of Euclidean embeddings often fails
to capture the hierarchical structure and fine-grained affinity variations
intrinsic to molecular interactions. In this work, we propose HypSeek, a
hyperbolic representation learning framework that embeds ligands, protein
pockets, and sequences into Lorentz-model hyperbolic space. By leveraging the
exponential geometry and negative curvature of hyperbolic space, HypSeek
enables expressive, affinity-sensitive embeddings that can effectively model
both global activity and subtle functional differences-particularly in
challenging cases such as activity cliffs, where structurally similar ligands
exhibit large affinity gaps. Our mode unifies virtual screening and affinity
ranking in a single framework, introducing a protein-guided three-tower
architecture to enhance representational structure. HypSeek improves early
enrichment in virtual screening on DUD-E from 42.63 to 51.44 (+20.7%) and
affinity ranking correlation on JACS from 0.5774 to 0.7239 (+25.4%),
demonstrating the benefits of hyperbolic geometry across both tasks and
highlighting its potential as a powerful inductive bias for protein-ligand
modeling.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
applications. However, due to the biases in the graph structures, graph neural
networks face significant challenges in fairness. Although the original user
graph structure is generally biased, it is promising to guide these existing
structures toward unbiased ones by introducing new links. The fairness guidance
via new links could foster unbiased communities, thereby enhancing fairness in
downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework
named FairGuide. Specifically, to ensure fairness in downstream tasks trained
on fairness-guided graphs, we introduce a differentiable community detection
task as a pseudo downstream task. Our theoretical analysis further demonstrates
that optimizing fairness within this pseudo task effectively enhances
structural fairness, promoting fairness generalization across diverse
downstream applications. Moreover, FairGuide employs an effective strategy
which leverages meta-gradients derived from the fairness-guidance objective to
identify new links that significantly enhance structural fairness. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
proposed method across a variety of graph-based fairness tasks.

TL;DR: SPOF是一种新的差分隐私训练机制，通过扰动损失函数的泰勒展开来保护多用户数据，比DP-SGD更高效、更稳定，隐私-效用权衡更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出一种用于多用户本地差分隐私（LDP）的差分隐私训练机制，以提高隐私保护的效率和稳定性。

Method: SPOF（Stabilization of Perturbed Loss Function）是一种差分隐私训练机制，用于多用户本地差分隐私（LDP）。它通过扰动模型训练损失函数的稳定泰勒展开多项式近似来实现用户数据的隐私化，通过向多项式系数添加校准噪声来保护每个用户的数据。SPOF不直接扰动损失函数的梯度，提高了计算效率和稳定性，并能同时为所有用户提供隐私保证。此外，SPOF还能抵抗训练过程中的环境噪声，即使在用户输入损坏的情况下也能保持稳定的性能。

Result: SPOF在无线体域网（WBAN）场景下，与DP-SGD相比，平均重建准确率提高了3.5%，平均训练时间减少了57.2%。

Conclusion: SPOF在多用户环境中实现了比DP-SGD更好的隐私-效用权衡，平均提高了3.5%的重建准确率，并减少了57.2%的平均训练时间。

Abstract: We propose SPOF (Stabilization of Perturbed Loss Function), a differentially
private training mechanism intended for multi-user local differential privacy
(LDP). SPOF perturbs a stabilized Taylor expanded polynomial approximation of a
model's training loss function, where each user's data is privatized by
calibrated noise added to the coefficients of the polynomial. Unlike
gradient-based mechanisms such as differentially private stochastic gradient
descent (DP-SGD), SPOF does not require injecting noise into the gradients of
the loss function, which improves both computational efficiency and stability.
This formulation naturally supports simultaneous privacy guarantees across all
users. Moreover, SPOF exhibits robustness to environmental noise during
training, maintaining stable performance even when user inputs are corrupted.
We compare SPOF with a multi-user extension of DP-SGD, evaluating both methods
in a wireless body area network (WBAN) scenario involving heterogeneous user
data and stochastic channel noise from body sensors. Our results show that SPOF
achieves, on average, up to 3.5% higher reconstruction accuracy and reduces
mean training time by up to 57.2% compared to DP-SGD, demonstrating superior
privacy-utility trade-offs in multi-user environments.

Motivation: 为工业泵系统提出一种实用的早期故障检测方法，以应对海洋环境中严苛工况下的大型立式离心泵。

Method: 利用来自大型立式离心泵的真实传感器数据，监测振动、温度、流量、压力和电流。应用双阈值标记方法，结合工程极限和基于历史数据计算的自适应阈值。通过注入合成故障信号来处理数据中罕见的已记录故障。使用随机森林、极端梯度提升（XGBoost）和支持向量机（SVM）三种机器学习分类器进行训练。

Abstract: This study presents a practical approach for early fault detection in
industrial pump systems using real-world sensor data from a large-scale
vertical centrifugal pump operating in a demanding marine environment. Five key
operational parameters were monitored: vibration, temperature, flow rate,
pressure, and electrical current. A dual-threshold labeling method was applied,
combining fixed engineering limits with adaptive thresholds calculated as the
95th percentile of historical sensor values. To address the rarity of
documented failures, synthetic fault signals were injected into the data using
domain-specific rules, simulating critical alerts within plausible operating
ranges. Three machine learning classifiers - Random Forest, Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - were trained to
distinguish between normal operation, early warnings, and critical alerts.
Results showed that Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved high accuracy
across all classes, including minority cases representing rare or emerging
faults, while the SVM model exhibited lower sensitivity to anomalies. Visual
analyses, including grouped confusion matrices and time-series plots, indicated
that the proposed hybrid method provides robust detection capabilities. The
framework is scalable, interpretable, and suitable for real-time industrial
deployment, supporting proactive maintenance decisions before failures occur.
Furthermore, it can be adapted to other machinery with similar sensor
architectures, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for predictive
maintenance in complex systems.

Abstract: Understanding the nuanced performance of machine learning models is essential
for responsible deployment, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare
and finance. This paper introduces a novel framework, Conformalized Exceptional
Model Mining, which combines the rigor of Conformal Prediction with the
explanatory power of Exceptional Model Mining (EMM). The proposed framework
identifies cohesive subgroups within data where model performance deviates
exceptionally, highlighting regions of both high confidence and high
uncertainty. We develop a new model class, mSMoPE (multiplex Soft Model
Performance Evaluation), which quantifies uncertainty through conformal
prediction's rigorous coverage guarantees. By defining a new quality measure,
Relative Average Uncertainty Loss (RAUL), our framework isolates subgroups with
exceptional performance patterns in multi-class classification and regression
tasks. Experimental results across diverse datasets demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in uncovering interpretable subgroups that provide critical
insights into model behavior. This work lays the groundwork for enhancing model
interpretability and reliability, advancing the state-of-the-art in explainable
AI and uncertainty quantification.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RoPE 在完全转换的设置下运行，需要在推理时访问一批测试样本，这限制了其可扩展性和泛化能力。为了解决这个问题，需要一个完全归纳和摊销的 SBI 框架。

Result: 在合成和现实世界基准测试中，包括复杂的医疗生物标志物估计，性能与 RoPE 及其他标准的 SBI 和非 SBI 估计器相当或更优，同时提高了可扩展性和适用性。

Conclusion: 该方法在合成和现实世界基准测试中，包括复杂的医疗生物标志物估计，其性能与 RoPE 及其他标准的 SBI 和非 SBI 估计器相当或更优，同时提高了在具有挑战性的、指定不充分的环境中的可扩展性和适用性。

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a statistical inference approach for
estimating latent parameters of a physical system when the likelihood is
intractable but simulations are available. In practice, SBI is often hindered
by model misspecification--the mismatch between simulated and real-world
observations caused by inherent modeling simplifications. RoPE, a recent SBI
approach, addresses this challenge through a two-stage domain transfer process
that combines semi-supervised calibration with optimal transport (OT)-based
distribution alignment. However, RoPE operates in a fully transductive setting,
requiring access to a batch of test samples at inference time, which limits
scalability and generalization. We propose here a fully inductive and amortized
SBI framework that integrates calibration and distributional alignment into a
single, end-to-end trainable model. Our method leverages mini-batch OT with a
closed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations that correspond
to the same latent parameters, using both paired calibration data and unpaired
samples. A conditional normalizing flow is then trained to approximate the
OT-induced posterior, enabling efficient inference without simulation access at
test time. Across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks--including
complex medical biomarker estimation--our approach matches or surpasses the
performance of RoPE, as well as other standard SBI and non-SBI estimators,
while offering improved scalability and applicability in challenging,
misspecified environments.

Result: CoNTM 在主题质量和预测困惑度方面始终优于动态主题模型，同时能够在线捕捉主题变化。

Conclusion: CoNTM 能够学习更多样化的主题并比现有方法更好地捕捉时间变化。

Abstract: In continual learning, our aim is to learn a new task without forgetting what
was learned previously. In topic models, this translates to learning new topic
models without forgetting previously learned topics. Previous work either
considered Dynamic Topic Models (DTMs), which learn the evolution of topics
based on the entire training corpus at once, or Online Topic Models, which are
updated continuously based on new data but do not have long-term memory. To
fill this gap, we propose the Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM), which
continuously learns topic models at subsequent time steps without forgetting
what was previously learned. This is achieved using a global prior distribution
that is continuously updated. In our experiments, CoNTM consistently
outperformed the dynamic topic model in terms of topic quality and predictive
perplexity while being able to capture topic changes online. The analysis
reveals that CoNTM can learn more diverse topics and better capture temporal
changes than existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised learning approaches for graph anomaly detection predominantly rely on spatial information or low-pass filters, losing capacity for multi-band analysis. Supervised methods are limited by the scarcity of labeled data. Anomalies on graphs induce spectral shifts, which can be utilized.

Method: GRASPED, an unsupervised learning model featuring an encoder based on Graph Wavelet Convolution, and structural and attribute decoders. The encoder, combined with a Wiener Graph Deconvolution-based decoder, captures global and local graph information at multiple scales, allowing for learning-based reconstruction of node attributes to capture anomaly information.

Result: GRASPED effectively captures anomaly information through a learning-based reconstruction of node attributes.

Conclusion: GRASPED outperforms current state-of-the-art models on several real-world graph anomaly detection datasets.

Abstract: Graph machine learning has been widely explored in various domains, such as
community detection, transaction analysis, and recommendation systems. In these
applications, anomaly detection plays an important role. Recently, studies have
shown that anomalies on graphs induce spectral shifts. Some supervised methods
have improved the utilization of such spectral domain information. However,
they remain limited by the scarcity of labeled data due to the nature of
anomalies. On the other hand, existing unsupervised learning approaches
predominantly rely on spatial information or only employ low-pass filters,
thereby losing the capacity for multi-band analysis. In this paper, we propose
Graph Autoencoder with Spectral Encoder and Spectral Decoder (GRASPED) for node
anomaly detection. Our unsupervised learning model features an encoder based on
Graph Wavelet Convolution, along with structural and attribute decoders. The
Graph Wavelet Convolution-based encoder, combined with a Wiener Graph
Deconvolution-based decoder, exhibits bandpass filter characteristics that
capture global and local graph information at multiple scales. This design
allows for a learning-based reconstruction of node attributes, effectively
capturing anomaly information. Extensive experiments on several real-world
graph anomaly detection datasets demonstrate that GRASPED outperforms current
state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: With the advent of wearable recorders, scientists are increasingly turning to
automated methods of analysis of audio and video data in order to measure
children's experience, behavior, and outcomes, with a sizable literature
employing long-form audio-recordings to study language acquisition. While
numerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular
automated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of
classification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the
estimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions). This paper proposes
a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key
scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language
experience and the association between children's production and their input.
In both the most commonly used \gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the
Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification
errors can significantly distort estimates. For instance, automated annotations
underestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\%,
potentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further
show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of
effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof
solution. Both the issue reported and our solution may apply to any classifier
involving event detection and classification with non-zero error rates.

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning is more important than ever as ethical concerns
continue to grow. Individual fairness demands that individuals differing only
in sensitive attributes receive the same outcomes. However, commonly used
machine learning algorithms often fail to achieve such fairness. To improve
individual fairness, various training methods have been developed, such as
incorporating fairness constraints as optimisation objectives. While these
methods have demonstrated empirical effectiveness, they lack formal guarantees
of fairness. Existing approaches that aim to provide fairness guarantees
primarily rely on verification techniques, which can sometimes fail to produce
definitive results. Moreover, verification alone does not actively enhance
individual fairness during training. To address this limitation, we propose a
novel framework that formally guarantees individual fairness throughout
training. Our approach consists of two parts, i.e., (1) provably fair
initialisation that ensures the model starts in a fair state, and (2) a
fairness-preserving training algorithm that maintains fairness as the model
learns. A key element of our method is the use of randomised response
mechanisms, which protect sensitive attributes while maintaining fairness
guarantees. We formally prove that this mechanism sustains individual fairness
throughout the training process. Experimental evaluations confirm that our
approach is effective, i.e., producing models that are empirically fair and
accurate. Furthermore, our approach is much more efficient than the alternative
approach based on certified training (which requires neural network
verification during training).

generating calibrated posterior predictions for newly enrolled patients after a
few early drug concentration measurements. This capability collapses
traditional model-development cycles from weeks to hours while preserving some
degree of expert modelling. Experiments across public datasets show that AICMET
attains state-of-the-art predictive accuracy and faithfully quantifies
inter-patient variability -- outperforming both nonlinear mixed-effects
baselines and recent neural ODE variants. Our results highlight the feasibility
of transformer-based, population-aware neural architectures as offering a new
alternative for bespoke pharmacokinetic modeling pipelines, charting a path
toward truly population-aware personalized dosing regimens.

TL;DR: 提出一种结合多任务学习和低秩张量分解的方法，用于解决异构亚群的个性化建模难题，实验证明其效果优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构亚群的个体特征和行为存在差异，对其进行有效的建模是一个挑战。

Method: 提出了一种结合多任务学习（MTL）和低秩张量分解的新方法。MTL用于利用任务间的共享结构和亚群的特异性变化，而低秩张量分解则将任务模型参数分解为低秩结构，以捕捉跨任务和亚群的共性与变异。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多任务学习和低秩张量分解，有效解决了异构亚群的个性化建模挑战，相比现有方法具有优越性能，并提高了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Effective modeling of heterogeneous subpopulations presents a significant
challenge due to variations in individual characteristics and behaviors. This
paper proposes a novel approach to address this issue through multi-task
learning (MTL) and low-rank tensor decomposition techniques. Our MTL approach
aims to enhance personalized modeling by leveraging shared structures among
similar tasks while accounting for distinct subpopulation-specific variations.
We introduce a framework where low-rank decomposition decomposes the collection
of task model parameters into a low-rank structure that captures commonalities
and variations across tasks and subpopulations. This approach allows for
efficient learning of personalized models by sharing knowledge between similar
tasks while preserving the unique characteristics of each subpopulation.
Experimental results in simulation and case study datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed method compared to several benchmarks,
particularly in scenarios with high variability among subpopulations. The
proposed framework not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances
interpretability by revealing underlying patterns that contribute to the
personalization of models.

*Eric Ye,Ren Tao,Natasha Jaques*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new multi-agent environment to help AI agents learn social intelligence, cooperation, and skills from experts, addressing real-world challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of deploying AI agents in real-world, multi-agent environments by developing socially intelligent AI that can learn from human experts and implicitly cooperate with other agents. This is motivated by the lack of suitable environments for studying such capabilities.

Method: The paper introduces a new multi-agent environment designed to study social intelligence in AI agents. The research investigates the impact of social learning, cooperation, and competition on agent performance within this environment.

Result: The paper investigates the impact of social learning in the presence of experts and implicit cooperation (like tool use) on agent performance, and whether agents benefit from cooperation or competition in the described environment.

Conclusion: While the study highlights the potential benefits of social learning and cooperation in multi-agent environments, it also implies that further research is needed to fully understand and harness these dynamics for AI development.

Abstract: Many challenges remain before AI agents can be deployed in real-world
environments. However, one virtue of such environments is that they are
inherently multi-agent and contain human experts. Using advanced social
intelligence in such an environment can help an AI agent learn adaptive skills
and behaviors that a known expert exhibits. While social intelligence could
accelerate training, it is currently difficult to study due to the lack of
open-ended multi-agent environments. In this work, we present an environment in
which multiple self-interested agents can pursue complex and independent goals,
reflective of real world challenges. This environment will enable research into
the development of socially intelligent AI agents in open-ended multi-agent
settings, where agents may be implicitly incentivized to cooperate to defeat
common enemies, build and share tools, and achieve long horizon goals. In this
work, we investigate the impact on agent performance due to social learning in
the presence of experts and implicit cooperation such as emergent collaborative
tool use, and whether agents can benefit from either cooperation or competition
in this environment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PECANN-CAPU通过改进约束执行、内存效率、多尺度处理和训练策略，提高了在科学计算中求解偏微分方程的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高 PECANN 框架学习经典偏微分方程（PDE）解的能力，对其物理和等约束人工神经网络（PECANN）进行改进。

Method: PECANN-CAPU框架通过以下方式进行改进：1. 推广增广拉格朗日方法（ALM）以支持多个独立的惩罚参数，实现异构约束的同时强制执行。2. 将点约束执行和拉格朗日乘数重新构建为约束项上的期望，以减少内存开销并实现有效的最小批量训练。3. 结合傅里叶特征映射来处理具有振荡、多尺度特征的偏微分方程，一个映射足以满足要求。4. 引入时间窗口策略，将每个窗口的终端状态强制作为下一个窗口的初始条件约束，以确保连续性。5. 提出一种条件自适应惩罚更新（CAPU）策略，用于ALM，以加速拉格朗日乘数的增长，从而在训练过程中加强约束执行。

Result: PECANN-CAPU 在跨音稀疏问题、涡流可逆平流、高波数亥姆霍兹和泊松方程以及空间变热源的逆向识别等问题上，展现了其有效性。

Conclusion: PECANN-CAPU在所有案例中均能达到具有竞争力的准确性，并且比已建立的方法和最近的Kolmogorov-Arnold网络方法更具鲁棒性、效率和适用性。

Abstract: We present several advances to the physics and equality constrained
artificial neural networks (PECANN) framework that substantially improve its
capability to learn solutions of canonical partial differential equations
(PDEs). First, we generalize the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) to support
multiple independent penalty parameters, enabling simultaneous enforcement of
heterogeneous constraints. Second, we reformulate pointwise constraint
enforcement and Lagrange multipliers as expectations over constraint terms,
reducing memory overhead and permitting efficient mini-batch training. Third,
to address PDEs with oscillatory, multi-scale features, we incorporate Fourier
feature mappings and show that a single mapping suffices where multiple
mappings or more costly architectures were required in related methods. Fourth,
we introduce a time-windowing strategy for long-time evolution in which the
terminal state of each window is enforced as an initial-condition constraint
for the next, ensuring continuity without discrete time models. Crucially, we
propose a conditionally adaptive penalty update (CAPU) strategy for ALM, which
preserves the principle that larger constraint violations incur stronger
penalties. CAPU accelerates the growth of Lagrange multipliers for selectively
challenging constraints, enhancing constraint enforcement during training. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of PECANN-CAPU on problems including the
transonic rarefaction problem, reversible advection of a passive by a vortex,
high-wavenumber Helmholtz and Poisson equations, and inverse identification of
spatially varying heat sources. Comparisons with established methods and recent
Kolmogorov-Arnold network approaches show that PECANN-CAPU achieves competitive
accuracy across all cases. Collectively, these advances improve PECANN's
robustness, efficiency, and applicability to demanding problems in scientific
computing.

*Amir Sarfi,Benjamin Thérien,Joel Lidin,Eugene Belilovsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SparseLoCo 通过稀疏化和量化技术，大幅降低了 LLM 分布式训练的通信成本，同时提高了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的通信高效分布式训练算法虽然降低了通信频率，但仍然需要通信模型梯度的完整副本，导致在数据中心跨互连和互联网等带宽受限的环境下存在通信瓶颈。此外，这些方法可能导致性能略有下降。因此，有必要开发一种能够实现更高通信压缩率并保持甚至提升模型性能的训练算法。

Method: SparseLoCo 算法的核心在于利用 Top-k 稀疏化和量化技术来减少通信量。该算法的创新点在于，它观察到外层动量可以通过结合误差反馈和稀疏化来进行局部近似，并且稀疏聚合能够提升模型性能。

Result: SparseLoCo 在通信受限的 LLM 训练设置中，实现了高达 1-3% 的稀疏度和 2 比特的量化，通信压缩率极高。实验证明，SparseLoCo 在性能和通信成本上均优于全精度的 DiLoCo，并且在各种通信受限的 LLM 训练场景中都显示出显著的优势。

Conclusion: SparseLoCo 是一种高效的分布式训练算法，通过结合 Top-k 稀疏化和量化技术，实现了高达 1-3% 的稀疏度和 2 比特的量化，并在通信受限的 LLM 预训练场景中，在性能和通信成本上都取得了显著的收益，甚至优于全精度的 DiLoCo。

Abstract: Communication-efficient distributed training algorithms have received
considerable interest recently due to their benefits for training Large
Language Models (LLMs) in bandwidth-constrained settings, such as across data
centers and over the internet. Despite reducing communication frequency, these
methods still typically require communicating a full copy of the model's
gradients-resulting in a communication bottleneck even for cross-datacenter
links. Furthermore, they can slightly degrade performance compared to a naive
AdamW DDP baseline. While quantization and error feedback are often applied to
reduce the pseudo-gradient's size, in the context of LLM pre-training, existing
approaches have been unable to additionally leverage sparsification and have
obtained limited quantization. In this work, we introduce SparseLoCo, a
communication-efficient training algorithm for LLMs that effectively leverages
Top-k sparsification and quantization to reach extreme compression ratios of up
to 1-3% sparsity and 2-bit quantization while outperforming full-precision
DiLoCo. Our key observations are that outer momentum can be locally
approximated by an error feedback combined with aggressive sparsity and that
sparse aggregation can actually improve model performance. We empirically
demonstrate in a range of communication-constrained LLM training settings that
SparseLoCo provides significant benefits in both performance and communication
cost.

TL;DR: 开源模型Intern-S1在科学领域表现优异，性能超越闭源模型，旨在缩小科学领域AI能力差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源基础模型在科学领域表现不足，与闭源模型存在显著差距，无法满足科研转型的需求。旨在缩小这一差距并迈向通用人工智能（AGI），需要专门的通才模型来处理多模态科学数据。

Method: Intern-S1是一个拥有280亿激活参数和2410亿总参数的多模态混合专家（MoE）模型，在5万亿（5T）token上进行了持续预训练（其中超过2.5T token来自科学领域）。在训练后期，通过我们提出的混合奖励（MoR）机制，模型在InternBootCamp的离线及在线强化学习（RL）阶段，同时处理超过1000个任务，实现了顶尖的在线RL训练性能。

Conclusion: Intern-S1在科学领域取得了超越闭源模型的领先地位，在通用推理任务上也展现出与开源模型相当的竞争力。

Abstract: In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged,
achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance
being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but
more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely
on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags
significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for
transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between
open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To
mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped
with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze
multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,
continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from
scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and
then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose
Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks
simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and
training systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL
training.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates
competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and
significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing
closed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular
synthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic
stabilities for crystals. Our models are available at

Abstract: Extracting meaning from uncertain, noisy data is a fundamental problem across
time series analysis, pattern recognition, and language modeling. This survey
presents a unified mathematical framework that connects classical estimation
theory, statistical inference, and modern machine learning, including deep
learning and large language models. By analyzing how techniques such as maximum
likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, and attention mechanisms address
uncertainty, the paper illustrates that many AI methods are rooted in shared
probabilistic principles. Through illustrative scenarios including system
identification, image classification, and language generation, we show how
increasingly complex models build upon these foundations to tackle practical
challenges like overfitting, data sparsity, and interpretability. In other
words, the work demonstrates that maximum likelihood, MAP estimation, Bayesian
classification, and deep learning all represent different facets of a shared
goal: inferring hidden causes from noisy and/or biased observations. It serves
as both a theoretical synthesis and a practical guide for students and
researchers navigating the evolving landscape of machine learning.

Motivation: AI 系统的安全部署受到 OOD 检测的限制，而数据似然性被认为是生成模型中最自然的 OOD 分数，但其实际应用效果不佳，本研究旨在探索其原因。

Method: 本研究训练了一个变分扩散模型，但在表示空间而不是图像上进行训练，以评估似然性检测器在 OOD 检测方面的性能。

Result: 研究发现，在表示空间中训练的扩散模型可以与最先进的方法相媲美，这表明似然性在 OOD 检测中具有潜力。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，在统一分布的 OOD 数据假设下，数据似然性是最佳的 OOD 检测器，并探索了在表示空间中训练变分扩散模型以评估似然性检测器的性能。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in AI, safety remains the main bottleneck to deploying
machine-learning systems. A critical safety component is out-of-distribution
detection: given an input, decide whether it comes from the same distribution
as the training data. In generative models, the most natural OOD score is the
data likelihood. Actually, under the assumption of uniformly distributed OOD
data, the likelihood is even the optimal OOD detector, as we show in this work.
However, earlier work reported that likelihood often fails in practice, raising
doubts about its usefulness. We explore whether, in practice, the
representation space also suffers from the inability to learn good density
estimation for OOD detection, or if it is merely a problem of the pixel space
typically used in generative models. To test this, we trained a Variational
Diffusion Model not on images, but on the representation space of a pre-trained
ResNet-18 to assess the performance of our likelihood-based detector in
comparison to state-of-the-art methods from the OpenOOD suite.

Result: 通过BGRPO微调后，Transformer模型的准确性得到了提升，同时可以将束宽度减少一半，从而降低约75%的推理计算量。此外，该模型在多项式简化任务上也表现出与Mathematica相当的性能，在某些情况下甚至优于Mathematica。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在多项式分解任务中展现出有竞争力的性能，并通过BGRPO优化后，在提高准确性的同时显著降低了计算资源消耗，并在多项式简化任务上优于Mathematica。

Abstract: Recent efforts have extended the capabilities of transformers in logical
reasoning and symbolic computations. In this work, we investigate their
capacity for non-linear latent pattern discovery in the context of functional
decomposition, focusing on the challenging algebraic task of multivariate
polynomial decomposition. This problem, with widespread applications in science
and engineering, is proved to be NP-hard, and demands both precision and
insight. Our contributions are threefold: First, we develop a synthetic data
generation pipeline providing fine-grained control over problem complexity.
Second, we train transformer models via supervised learning and evaluate them
across four key dimensions involving scaling behavior and generalizability.
Third, we propose Beam Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (BGRPO), a
rank-aware reinforcement learning method suitable for hard algebraic problems.
Finetuning with BGRPO improves accuracy while reducing beam width by up to

Motivation: 類比儲存器內計算（IMC）系統面臨兩大挑戰：卡滯故障（SAFs）導致的計算不可靠性，以及現有容錯演算法（如Fault-Free, FF）的高編譯開銷。這些挑戰限制了IMC系統的可擴展性和部署性。

Abstract: This paper addresses two critical challenges in analog In-Memory Computing
(IMC) systems that limit their scalability and deployability: the computational
unreliability caused by stuck-at faults (SAFs) and the high compilation
overhead of existing fault-mitigation algorithms, namely Fault-Free (FF). To
overcome these limitations, we first propose a novel multi-bit weight
representation technique, termed row-column hybrid grouping, which generalizes
conventional column grouping by introducing redundancy across both rows and
columns. This structural redundancy enhances fault tolerance and can be
effectively combined with existing fault-mitigation solutions. Second, we
design a compiler pipeline that reformulates the fault-aware weight
decomposition problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) task, enabling
fast and scalable compilation through off-the-shelf solvers. Further
acceleration is achieved through theoretical insights that identify fault
patterns amenable to trivial solutions, significantly reducing computation.

TL;DR: AI评估需考虑战略推理，博弈论可用于设计评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在说明AI测试和评估的两个主张：首先，为了保持对部署行为的信息性，评估需要考虑AI系统理解其环境并进行战略推理的可能性；其次，博弈论分析可以通过形式化和审查基于评估的安全案例中的推理来为评估设计提供信息。

Method: 本文通过对现有AI系统的示例、相关研究的回顾以及对风格化评估场景的正式战略分析来支持其论点。

Result: 本文提出了AI测试和评估的两个主张，并提供了支持这些主张的证据，同时激发了若干研究方向。

Conclusion: AI系统的评估应考虑其理解环境和进行战略推理的可能性，而博弈论分析可为评估设计提供信息，通过形式化和审查基于评估的安全案例中的推理。

Abstract: This position paper argues for two claims regarding AI testing and
evaluation. First, to remain informative about deployment behaviour,
evaluations need account for the possibility that AI systems understand their
circumstances and reason strategically. Second, game-theoretic analysis can
inform evaluation design by formalising and scrutinising the reasoning in
evaluation-based safety cases. Drawing on examples from existing AI systems, a
review of relevant research, and formal strategic analysis of a stylised
evaluation scenario, we present evidence for these claims and motivate several
research directions.

TL;DR: 本研究提出“局部无嫉妒”新概念，旨在解决匹配中的效率与公平性冲突。研究表明，在特定条件下，可以实现同时满足局部无嫉妒和帕累托最优的匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的两类匹配研究中，效率和公平性常常相互冲突，尤其是帕累托最优和无嫉妒性。现有研究多通过容忍学生嫉妒来提高效率，本研究则提出一种新的思路，即只关注学生可能更看重或更优先处理的嫉妒，旨在寻找没有此类嫉妒的匹配。

Method: 本研究提出了“局部无嫉妒”作为一种新的公平性放松概念，并在此基础上研究了帕累托最优匹配的实现。通过分析图结构和学校偏好，以及引入Cho等人提出的局部无嫉妒的参数化版本，来量化和分析不同程度的局部无嫉妒。

Result: 研究发现，在特定的图结构（接近树）和单峰偏好下，可以实现带有“局部无嫉妒”的帕累托最优匹配。此外，研究还明确了针对这些图结构可以达到的局部无嫉妒水平。

Conclusion: 本研究通过引入“局部无嫉妒”的概念，放宽了公平性约束，在特定图结构和学校偏好下，探究了实现帕累托最优匹配的可能性，并分析了不同程度的局部无嫉妒对匹配的影响。

Abstract: Two-sided matching, such as matching between students and schools, has been
applied to various aspects of real life and has been the subject of much
research, however, it has been plagued by the fact that efficiency and fairness
are incompatible. In particular, Pareto efficiency and justified-envy-freeness
are known to be incompatible even in the simplest one-to-one matching, i.e.,
the stable marriage problem. In previous research, the primary approach to
improving efficiency in matchings has been to tolerate students' envy, thereby
relaxing fairness constraints. In this study, we take a different approach to
relaxing fairness. Specifically, it focuses on addressing only the envy that
students may experience or prioritize more highly and seeks matchings without
such envy. More specifically, this study assumes that envy towards students who
are not acquaintances has less impact compared to envy towards students who are
acquaintances. Accordingly, we assume that the students know each other or not,
represented by an undirected graph, and define a local envy as a justified envy
toward an acquaintance or a neighbor in the graph. We then propose the property
that there is no local envy as a new relaxed concept of fairness, called local
envy-freeness. We analyze whether Pareto-efficient matching can be achieved
while maintaining local envy-freeness by meaningfully restricting the graph
structure and the school's preferences. To analyze in detail the fairness that
can achieve Pareto-efficient matching, we introduce a local version of the
relaxed fairness recently proposed by Cho et al. (AAMAS 2024), which
parameterizes the level of local envy-freeness by nonnegative integers. We then
clarify the level of local envy-freeness that can be achieved by
Pareto-efficient mechanisms for graphs that are ``close'' to trees and
single-peaked preferences on the graphs.

Conclusion: 如果存在约束纳什均衡，那么必须存在一个使得策略中的概率呈双指数级小。

Abstract: A strategy profile in a multi-player game is a Nash equilibrium if no player
can unilaterally deviate to achieve a strictly better payoff. A profile is an
$\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium if no player can gain more than $\epsilon$ by
unilaterally deviating from their strategy. In this work, we use
$\epsilon$-Nash equilibria to approximate the computation of Nash equilibria.
Specifically, we focus on turn-based, multiplayer stochastic games played on
graphs, where players are restricted to stationary strategies -- strategies
that use randomness but not memory.
  The problem of deciding the constrained existence of stationary Nash
equilibria -- where each player's payoff must lie within a given interval -- is
known to be $\exists\mathbb{R}$-complete in such a setting (Hansen and
S{\o}lvsten, 2020). We extend this line of work to stationary $\epsilon$-Nash
equilibria and present an algorithm that solves the following promise problem:
given a game with a Nash equilibrium satisfying the constraints, compute an
$\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium that $\epsilon$-satisfies those same constraints --
satisfies the constraints up to an $\epsilon$ additive error. Our algorithm
runs in FNP^NP time.
  To achieve this, we first show that if a constrained Nash equilibrium exists,
then one exists where the non-zero probabilities are at least an inverse of a
double-exponential in the input. We further prove that such a strategy can be
encoded using floating-point representations, as in the work of Frederiksen and
Miltersen (2013), which finally gives us our FNP^NP algorithm.
  We further show that the decision version of the promise problem is NP-hard.
Finally, we show a partial tightness result by proving a lower bound for such
techniques: if a constrained Nash equilibrium exists, then there must be one
that where the probabilities in the strategies are double-exponentially small.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在具有多个估值的代理之间公平分配物品的问题，扩展了无羡慕分配（EFX）保证的条件，并提出了带慈善的 EFX 分配的界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在解决在具有多个独立估值的代理之间公平分配一系列不可分割物品的问题，目标是实现近似无羡慕（α-EFX）分配，并进一步研究了带慈善的 EFX 分配的松弛条件。

Method: 该论文采用理论分析方法，研究了不可分割物品在具有不同估值的代理之间的公平分配问题，重点关注近似无羡慕（α-EFX）和带慈善的 EFX 分配。

Result: 研究表明，当存在最多四个不同估值时，对于任何数量的代理，都可以实现 2/3-EFX 分配。此外，当存在最多 k 个不同估值时，可以实现带有所需慈善水平的 EFX 分配。

Conclusion: 这项工作表明，当存在最多 k 个不同估值时，对于任何数量的代理，都可以实现 2/3-EFX 分配。此外，它还表明，当存在最多 k 个不同估值时，可以实现带有所需慈善水平的 EFX 分配。

Abstract: We study the problem of fair allocation of a set of indivisible goods among
$n$ agents with $k$ distinct additive valuations, with the goal of achieving
approximate envy-freeness up to any good ($\alpha-\mathrm{EFX}$).
  It is known that EFX allocations exist for $n$ agents when there are at most
three distinct valuations due to HV et al. Furthermore, Amanatidis et al.
showed that a $\frac{2}{3}-\mathrm{EFX}$ allocation is guaranteed to exist when
number of agents is at most seven. In this paper, we show that a
$\frac{2}{3}-\mathrm{EFX}$ allocation exists for any number of agents when
there are at most four distinct valuations.
  Secondly, we consider a relaxation called $\mathrm{EFX}$ with charity, where
some goods remain unallocated such that no agent envies the set of unallocated
goods. Akrami et al. showed that for $n$ agents and any $\varepsilon \in
\left(0, \frac{1}{2}\right]$, there exists a $(1-\varepsilon)-\mathrm{EFX}$
allocation with at most $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}((n/\varepsilon)^{\frac{1}{2}})$
goods to charity. In this paper, we show that a $(1-\varepsilon)-\mathrm{EFX}$
allocation with a $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(k/\varepsilon)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ charity
exists for any number of agents when there are at most $k$ distinct valuations.

Abstract: Agent-based simulation platforms play a key role in enabling fast-to-run
evolution experiments that can be precisely controlled and observed in detail.
Availability of high-resolution snapshots of lineage ancestries from digital
experiments, in particular, is key to investigations of evolvability and
open-ended evolution, as well as in providing a validation testbed for
bioinformatics method development. Ongoing advances in AI/ML hardware
accelerator devices, such as the 850,000-processor Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine
(WSE), are poised to broaden the scope of evolutionary questions that can be
investigated in silico. However, constraints in memory capacity and locality
characteristic of these systems introduce difficulties in exhaustively tracking
phylogenies at runtime. To overcome these challenges, recent work on hereditary
stratigraphy algorithms has developed space-efficient genetic markers to
facilitate fully decentralized estimation of relatedness among digital
organisms. However, in existing work, compute time to reconstruct phylogenies
from these genetic markers has proven a limiting factor in achieving
large-scale phyloanalyses. Here, we detail an improved trie-building algorithm
designed to produce reconstructions equivalent to existing approaches. For
modestly-sized 10,000-tip trees, the proposed approach achieves a 300-fold
speedup versus existing state-of-the-art. Finally, using 1 billion genome
datasets drawn from WSE simulations encompassing 954 trillion replication
events, we report a pair of large-scale phylogeny reconstruction trials,
achieving end-to-end reconstruction times of 2.6 and 2.9 hours. In
substantially improving reconstruction scaling and throughput, presented work
establishes a key foundation to enable powerful high-throughput phyloanalysis
techniques in large-scale digital evolution experiments.

### [356] [From Basic Affordances to Symbolic Thought: A Computational Phylogenesis of Biological Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15082)
*John E. Hummel,Rachel F. Heaton*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: Human brains achieve symbolic thought through dynamic binding plus hierarchical integration (multi-place predicates and structure mapping), unlike most animals. Simulations confirm these are minimal requirements, with implications for AI and understanding biological intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what enables human brains to perform symbolic reasoning, unlike most other animals, by investigating the necessity and sufficiency of dynamic binding and proposing hierarchical integration (multi-place predicates and structure mapping) as minimal requirements.

Method: The hypothesis was tested using 17 systematic simulations exploring cognitive architectures with and without multi-place predicates and structure mapping, across various tasks designed to be generic and dependent on these capacities.

Result: The simulations demonstrated that cognitive architectures possessing multi-place predicates and structure mapping, along with dynamic binding, were capable of performing tasks indicative of symbolic thought, consistent with the hypothesis.

Conclusion: The results support the hypothesis that, in addition to dynamic binding, multi-place predicates and structure mapping are minimal requirements for basic symbolic thought, informing our understanding of human brain capabilities and the differences between biological and artificial intelligence.

Abstract: What is it about human brains that allows us to reason symbolically whereas
most other animals cannot? There is evidence that dynamic binding, the ability
to combine neurons into groups on the fly, is necessary for symbolic thought,
but there is also evidence that it is not sufficient. We propose that two kinds
of hierarchical integration (integration of multiple role-bindings into
multiplace predicates, and integration of multiple correspondences into
structure mappings) are minimal requirements, on top of basic dynamic binding,
to realize symbolic thought. We tested this hypothesis in a systematic
collection of 17 simulations that explored the ability of cognitive
architectures with and without the capacity for multi-place predicates and
structure mapping to perform various kinds of tasks. The simulations were as
generic as possible, in that no task could be performed based on any diagnostic
features, depending instead on the capacity for multi-place predicates and
structure mapping. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that, along
with dynamic binding, multi-place predicates and structure mapping are minimal
requirements for basic symbolic thought. These results inform our understanding
of how human brains give rise to symbolic thought and speak to the differences
between biological intelligence, which tends to generalize broadly from very
few training examples, and modern approaches to machine learning, which
typically require millions or billions of training examples. The results we
report also have important implications for bio-inspired artificial
intelligence.
