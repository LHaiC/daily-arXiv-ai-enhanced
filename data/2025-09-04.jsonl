A major unsolved problem, addressed in this\npaper, is how to devise \\textit{representational-system (RS) agnostic}\ntechniques that drive representation transformation and choice. We present a\nnovel calculus, called \\textit{structure transfer}, that enables representation\ntransformation across diverse RSs. Specifically, given a \\textit{source}\nrepresentation drawn from a source RS, the rules of structure transfer allow us\nto generate a \\textit{target} representation for a target RS. The generality of\nstructure transfer comes in part from its ability to ensure that the source\nrepresentation and the generated target representation satisfy \\textit{any}\nspecified relation (such as semantic equivalence). This is done by exploiting\n\\textit{schemas}, which encode knowledge about RSs. Specifically, schemas can\nexpress \\textit{preservation of information} across relations between any pair\nof RSs, and this knowledge is used by structure transfer to derive a structure\nfor the target representation which ensures that the desired relation holds. We\nformalise this using Representational Systems Theory~\\cite{raggi2022rst},\nbuilding on the key concept of a \\textit{construction space}.

A practical consequence of these\ndynamics is the \\textit{performatively stable equilibrium}, where each player's\nstrategy is a best response under the induced distribution.

While their\nextension to video has enabled tasks such as video question answering and video\ncaptioning, their pixel-level visual grounding abilities are less studied. In\nthis work, we raise the pertinent question of whether motion is used in\npixel-level visual grounding and whether video MLLMs can segment objects based\non natural language expressions describing their motion patterns. We identify\nthe shortcomings in the current benchmarks, where we show that a single frame\ncan often suffice for capturing the motion referring expression without any\ntemporal reasoning. To address this, we introduce four motion-centric probing\ntechniques, particularly designed for the visual grounding task, to study video\nMLLMs' ability to identify true motion from a fake one and their ability to\ngrasp the motion order. Consequently, we provide a motion-centric benchmark,\nMoCentric-Bench.

They simultaneously exhibit mechanisms for electrical detection of\nmagnetic order through the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect, and\nreciprocally, for controlling magnetic order by electric currents through\nspin-transfer torque (STT). It was long assumed that neither of these effects\ncould be sizeable in tunnel junctions made from antiferromagnetic materials,\nsince they exhibit no net magnetization. Recently, however, it was shown that\nall-antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) based on chiral\nantiferromagnets do exhibit TMR due to their non-relativistic\nmomentum-dependent spin polarization and cluster magnetic octupole moment,\nwhich are manifestations of their spin-split band structure. However, the\nreciprocal effect, i.e., the antiferromagnetic counterpart of STT driven by\ncurrents through the AFMTJ, has been assumed non-existent due to the total\nelectric current being spin-neutral.

Unfortunately, the currently available Noisy\nIntermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware is still heavily affected by noise.\nMany optimization techniques have been developed to reduce the negative effects\nthereof, which, however, only works up to a certain point. Therefore, scaling\nquantum applications from currently considered small research examples to\nindustrial applications requires error-correction techniques to execute quantum\ncircuits in a fault-tolerant fashion and enter the Fault-Tolerant Quantum\nComputing (FTQC) era. These error-correction techniques introduce dramatic\nqubit overheads, leading to the requirement of tens of thousands of qubits\nalready for toy-sized examples. Hence, quantum circuit optimization that\nreduces qubit overheads when shifting from the NISQ to the FTQC era is\nessential. This raises the question, whether we need to start from scratch, or\nwhether current state-of-the-art optimization techniques can be used as a basis\nfor this. To approach this question, this work investigates the effects of\ndifferent optimization passes on a representative selection of quantum\ncircuits. Since hardly any tools to automatically design and evaluate FTQC\nquantum circuits exist yet, we utilize resource estimation to compare the\n(potential) benefits gained by applying NISQ quantum circuit optimization to\nestimated FTQC resource requirements. The results indicate that, indeed, the\nestimated resource requirements for FTQC can be improved by applying NISQ\nquantum circuit optimization techniques.

While training an optimal policy DNN, we observed that\nunder certain constraints, a gentle structure resembling neural collapse, which\nwe refer to as Action Collapse (AC), emerges. This suggests that 1) the\nstate-action activations (i.e. last-layer features) sharing the same optimal\nactions collapse towards those optimal actions respective mean activations; 2)\nthe variability of activations sharing the same optimal actions converges to\nzero; 3) the weights of action selection layer and the mean activations\ncollapse to a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF). Our early work showed\nthose aforementioned constraints to be necessary for these observations. Since\nthe collapsed ETF of optimal policy DNNs maximally separates the pair-wise\nangles of all actions in the state-action space, we naturally raise a question:\ncan we learn an optimal policy using an ETF structure as a (fixed) target\nconfiguration in the action selection layer?

Although the agent in\nthe choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this\nparadigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their\nanticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections.

In this work, we demonstrate that\nquantization causes significantly higher accuracy degradation in DP-SGD\ncompared to regular SGD. We observe that this is caused by noise injection in\nDP-SGD, which amplifies quantization variance, leading to disproportionately\nlarge accuracy degradation. To address this challenge, we present QPQuant, a\ndynamic quantization framework that adaptively selects a changing subset of\nlayers to quantize at each epoch. Our method combines two key ideas that\neffectively reduce quantization variance: (i) probabilistic sampling of the\nlayers that rotates which layers are quantized every epoch, and (ii) loss-aware\nlayer prioritization, which uses a differentially private loss sensitivity\nestimator to identify layers that can be quantized with minimal impact on model\nquality. This estimator consumes a negligible fraction of the overall privacy\nbudget, preserving DP guarantees.

It was long assumed that neither of these effects\ncould be sizeable in tunnel junctions made from antiferromagnetic materials,\nsince they exhibit no net magnetization. Recently, however, it was shown that\nall-antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) based on chiral\nantiferromagnets do exhibit TMR due to their non-relativistic\nmomentum-dependent spin polarization and cluster magnetic octupole moment,\nwhich are manifestations of their spin-split band structure.

Traditional control systems, which are human\nand optimization-based, struggle to adapt and to scale in such an evolving\ncontext, motivating the exploration of more dynamic and distributed control\nstrategies. This work advances a graph-based distributed reinforcement learning\nframework for real-time, scalable grid management.

A Graph Neural\nNetwork (GNN) is employed to encode the network's topological information\nwithin the single low-level agent's observation. To accelerate convergence and\nenhance learning stability, the framework integrates imitation learning and\npotential-based reward shaping. In contrast to conventional decentralized\napproaches that decompose only the action space while relying on global\nobservations, this method also decomposes the observation space. Each low-level\nagent acts based on a structured and informative local view of the environment\nconstructed through the GNN.

We introduce simulation-based\ninference for causal evaluation (SBICE), a framework that models generative\nparameters as uncertain and infers their posterior distribution given a source\ndataset. Leveraging techniques in simulation-based inference, SBICE identifies\nparameter configurations that produce synthetic datasets closely aligned with\nthe source data distribution. Empirical results demonstrate that SBICE improves\nthe reliability of estimator evaluations by generating more realistic datasets,\nwhich supports a robust and data-consistent approach to causal benchmarking\nunder uncertainty."}

They simultaneously exhibit mechanisms for electrical detection of\nmagnetic order through the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect, and\nreciprocally, for controlling magnetic order by electric currents through\nspin-transfer torque (STT). It was long assumed that neither of these effects\ncould be sizeable in tunnel junctions made from antiferromagnetic materials,\nsince they exhibit no net magnetization. Recently, however, it was shown that\nall-antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) based on chiral\nantiferromagnets do exhibit TMR due to their non-relativistic\nmomentum-dependent spin polarization and cluster magnetic octupole moment,\nwhich are manifestations of their spin-split band structure.

Numerous visual-only approaches\naddress these issues by partitioning an image and applying attention modules,\nyet they rely on costly manual annotations and struggle with complex\nocclusions. Recent multimodal methods, motivated by CLIP, introduce semantic\ncues to guide visual understanding. However, they focus solely on foreground\ninformation, but overlook the potential value of background cues. Inspired by\nhuman perception, we argue that background semantics are as important as the\nforeground semantics in ReID, as humans tend to eliminate background\ndistractions while focusing on target appearance. Therefore, this paper\nproposes an end-to-end framework that jointly models foreground and background\ninformation within a dual-branch cross-modal feature extraction pipeline.

However, it remains unclear how to determine the\nlearning rates for such orthogonalized updates. AdaGrad, by contrast, is a\nwidely used adaptive method that scales stochastic gradients by accumulated\npast gradients. We propose a new algorithm, AdaGO, which combines a norm-based\nAdaGrad-type stepsize with an orthogonalized update direction, bringing\ntogether the benefits of both approaches. Unlike other adaptive variants of\nMuon, AdaGO preserves the orthogonality of the update direction, which can be\ninterpreted as a spectral descent direction, while adapting the stepsizes to\nthe optimization landscape by scaling the direction with accumulated past\ngradient norms. The implementation of AdaGO requires only minimal modification\nto Muon, with a single additional scalar variable, the accumulated squared\ngradient norms, to be computed, making it computationally and memory efficient.\nOptimal theoretical convergence rates are established for nonconvex functions\nin both stochastic and deterministic settings under standard smoothness and\nunbiased bounded-variance noise assumptions.

Pre-training broke the symmetry among\ntokens and grouped them into finite, small, strong match token clusters, as\ninferred from the presented token confusion matrix.

This module performs continuous\ntraining state monitoring, enabling immediate identification of hardware and\nsoftware failures within seconds, thus ensuring rapid incident response; (2)\nScale-independent task restart. By employing different recovery strategies for\nnormal and faulty nodes, combined with an optimized communication group\nreconstruction protocol, our approach ensures that the recovery time remains\nnearly constant, regardless of cluster scale; (3) Checkpoint-free recovery\nwithin one step. Our novel recovery mechanism enables single-step restoration,\ncompletely eliminating dependence on traditional checkpointing methods and\ntheir associated overhead. Collectively, these innovations enable FlashRecovery\nto achieve optimal Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective\n(RPO), substantially improving the reliability and efficiency of long-duration\nLLM training. Experimental results demonstrate that FlashRecovery system can\nachieve training restoration on training cluster with 4, 800 devices in 150\nseconds. We also verify that the time required for failure recovery is nearly\nconsistent for different scales of training tasks."}

We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel\ncorrespondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering\npixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D\nrepresentation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects\nthe inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose\nPointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing\nexplicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal\nspatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry\ninformation to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To\nsimultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes\nhierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit\nanomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the\nrendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy\ncontrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between\nthe rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning.\nFinally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the\ngeneralized anomaly semantics.

Within DRL-based TSC methods, two primary control\nparadigms are ``choose phase\" and ``switch\" strategies. Although the agent in\nthe choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this\nparadigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their\nanticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections. Meanwhile,\nthe switch paradigm allows the agent to decide whether to switch to the next\npredefined phase or extend the current phase. While this structure maintains a\nmore predictable order, it can lead to unfair and inefficient phase\nallocations, as certain movements may be extended disproportionately while\nothers are neglected. In this paper, we propose a DRL model, named Deep\nHierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP), to allocate the traffic signal cycle\nduration hierarchically. A high-level agent first determines the split of the\ntotal cycle time between the North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions\nbased on the overall traffic state.

A major unsolved problem, addressed in this\npaper, is how to devise \\textit{representational-system (RS) agnostic}\ntechniques that drive representation transformation and choice.

Specifically, given a \\textit{source}\nrepresentation drawn from a source RS, the rules of structure transfer allow us\nto generate a \\textit{target} representation for a target RS. The generality of\nstructure transfer comes in part from its ability to ensure that the source\nrepresentation and the generated target representation satisfy \\textit{any}\nspecified relation (such as semantic equivalence). This is done by exploiting\n\\textit{schemas}, which encode knowledge about RSs. Specifically, schemas can\nexpress \\textit{preservation of information} across relations between any pair\nof RSs, and this knowledge is used by structure transfer to derive a structure\nfor the target representation which ensures that the desired relation holds. We\nformalise this using Representational Systems Theory~\\cite{raggi2022rst},\nbuilding on the key concept of a \\textit{construction space}.

To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a\nsynthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs\nwith spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces\ndiverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates\ntemporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and\ntemporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their\nlocations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our\napproach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal\nreferences, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for\nreal-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human\nannotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental\nevaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform\nbaselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally,\nthese models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new\nfoundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs."}

Recent advances in quantum sensing have shown that\nthis limit can be circumvented through spatial demultiplexing (SPADE) and\nphoton detection. Notably, the latter is a semi-classical detection strategy,\nbeing SPADE a linear transformation of the field and photon detection a\nmeasurement of intensity. However, the general optimality for arbitrary\nintensity distributions and bright sources remains unproven. In this work, we\ndevelop a general model for incoherent light with arbitrary intensity collected\nby passive, linear optical systems. We employ this framework to compute the\nquantum Chernoff exponent for generic incoherent-source discrimination\nproblems, and we analyze several special cases, with particular focus on the\nsubdiffraction regime for Gaussian point-spread functions. We show that,\nsurprisingly, SPADE measurements do not always saturate the quantum Chernoff\nbound in the subdiffraction regime; the quantum optimality holds only when\ncertain compatibility conditions, such as covariance matrix commutativity, are\nmet. These findings suggest that collective measurements may actually be needed\nto achieve the ultimate quantum Chernoff bound for the discrimination of\nspecific incoherent sources. For the fully general case, our analysis can still\nbe used to find the best SPADE configurations, generally achieved through a\nhypotheses-dependent rotation of the SPADE modes.

A major unsolved problem, addressed in this\npaper, is how to devise \\textit{representational-system (RS) agnostic}\ntechniques that drive representation transformation and choice.

Specifically, given a \\textit{source}\nrepresentation drawn from a source RS, the rules of structure transfer allow us\nto generate a \\textit{target} representation for a target RS. The generality of\nstructure transfer comes in part from its ability to ensure that the source\nrepresentation and the generated target representation satisfy \\textit{any}\nspecified relation (such as semantic equivalence). This is done by exploiting\n\\textit{schemas}, which encode knowledge about RSs. Specifically, schemas can\nexpress \\textit{preservation of information} across relations between any pair\nof RSs, and this knowledge is used by structure transfer to derive a structure\nfor the target representation which ensures that the desired relation holds. We\nformalise this using Representational Systems Theory~\\cite{raggi2022rst},\nbuilding on the key concept of a \\textit{construction space}.

To improve generalization\nunder spectral and phenological shifts, we design CropNet, a lightweight and\nrobust CNN tailored for pixel-level crop classification, coupled with temporal\ndata augmentation (time shift, time scale, and magnitude warping) that\nsimulates realistic cross-regional phenology.

However, these systems do not explicitly optimize their\nquery plans which can lead to poor plan execution. In order for AI-driven\nanalytics to excel, we need a runtime which combines the optimized execution of\nsemantic operators with the flexibility and more dynamic execution of Deep\nResearch systems. As a first step towards this vision, we build a prototype\nwhich enables Deep Research agents to write and execute optimized semantic\noperator programs. We evaluate our prototype and demonstrate that it can\noutperform a handcrafted semantic operator program and open Deep Research\nsystems on two basic queries. Compared to a standard open Deep Research agent,\nour prototype achieves up to 1.95x better F1-score. Furthermore, even if we\ngive the agent access to semantic operators as tools, our prototype still\nachieves cost and runtime savings of up to 76.8% and 72.7% thanks to its\noptimized execution."}

This study examines whether WOMD accurately\ncaptures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations.\nLeveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV\noperations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across\nthree representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized\nintersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging\nanalysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure\nnegligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we\napply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically\nestimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to\nquantify behavioral differences.

Our analysis shows that the ROLAND temporal GNN outperforms\nthe baseline model in most cases, whereas the other three GNNs perform on\naverage worse than the baseline. The results show that GNN based approaches\nhold promise in the analysis of temporal social networks through mobile\nconnectivity data. However, due to the relatively small performance margin\nbetween ROLAND and the baseline model, further research is required on\nspecialized GNN architectures for temporal social network analysis."}

Among them, diffusers stand out for their ability to address\nsparse-reward challenges by focusing on trajectory-level accumulated rewards,\nas well as their explainable capability, i.e., planning a future trajectory of\nstates and executing bids accordingly. However, diffusers struggle with\ngeneration uncertainty, particularly regarding dynamic legitimacy between\nadjacent states, which can lead to poor bids and further cause significant loss\nof ad impression opportunities when competing with other advertisers in a\nhighly competitive auction environment. To address it, we propose a Causal\nauto-Bidding method based on a Diffusion completer-aligner framework, termed\nCBD. Firstly, we augment the diffusion training process with an extra random\nvariable t, where the model observes t-length historical sequences with the\ngoal of completing the remaining sequence, thereby enhancing the generated\nsequences' dynamic legitimacy. Then, we employ a trajectory-level return model\nto refine the generated trajectories, aligning more closely with advertisers'\nobjectives. Experimental results across diverse settings demonstrate that our\napproach not only achieves superior performance on large-scale auto-bidding\nbenchmarks, such as a 29.9% improvement in conversion value in the challenging\nsparse-reward auction setting, but also delivers significant improvements on\nthe Kuaishou online advertising platform, including a 2.0% increase in target\ncost."}

In multi-tenant cloud environments, virtual machines are\nconsolidated on shared physical servers to improve resource utilization. While\nvirtualization guarantees resource partitioning for CPU, memory, and storage,\nit cannot ensure performance isolation. Competition for shared resources such\nas last-level cache, memory bandwidth, and network interfaces often leads to\nsevere performance degradation. Existing management techniques, including VM\nscheduling and resource provisioning, require accurate performance prediction\nto mitigate interference. However, this remains challenging in public clouds\ndue to the black-box nature of VMs and the highly dynamic nature of workloads.\nTo address these limitations, we propose CloudFormer, a dual-branch\nTransformer-based model designed to predict VM performance degradation in\nblack-box environments. CloudFormer jointly models temporal dynamics and\nsystem-level interactions, leveraging 206 system metrics at one-second\nresolution across both static and dynamic scenarios. This design enables the\nmodel to capture transient interference effects and adapt to varying workload\nconditions without scenario-specific tuning. Complementing the methodology, we\nprovide a fine-grained dataset that significantly expands the temporal\nresolution and metric diversity compared to existing benchmarks. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that CloudFormer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving robust generalization\nacross diverse and previously unseen workloads. Notably, CloudFormer attains a\nmean absolute error (MAE) of just 7.8%, representing a substantial improvement\nin predictive accuracy and outperforming existing methods at least by 28%."}

However, the modalities available in\nclinical settings can vary across different locations and patients. A key area\nthat stands to gain from multimodal integration is breast cancer molecular\nsubtyping, an important clinical task that can facilitate personalized\ntreatment and improve patient prognosis. In this work, we propose a scalable\nand loosely-coupled multimodal framework that seamlessly integrates data from\nvarious modalities, including copy number variation (CNV), clinical records,\nand histopathology images, to enhance breast cancer subtyping. While our\nprimary focus is on breast cancer, our framework is designed to easily\naccommodate additional modalities, offering the flexibility to scale up or down\nwith minimal overhead without requiring re-training of existing modalities,\nmaking it applicable to other types of cancers as well. We introduce a\ndual-based representation for whole slide images (WSIs), combining traditional\nimage-based and graph-based WSI representations. This novel dual approach\nresults in significant performance improvements. Moreover, we present a new\nmultimodal fusion strategy, demonstrating its ability to enhance performance\nacross a range of multimodal conditions. Our comprehensive results show that\nintegrating our dual-based WSI representation with CNV and clinical health\nrecords, along with our pipeline and fusion strategy, outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in breast cancer subtyping."}

To expedite such studies, this work\nleverages recent advances in quantum computing to find or predict AC PF\nsolutions using a variational quantum circuit (VQC). VQCs are trainable models\nthat run on modern-day noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware to\naccomplish elaborate optimization and machine learning (ML) tasks.

To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a\nsynthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs\nwith spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces\ndiverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates\ntemporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and\ntemporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their\nlocations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our\napproach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal\nreferences, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for\nreal-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human\nannotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental\nevaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform\nbaselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally,\nthese models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new\nfoundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs."}

A Validation Study with Naturalistic Trajectories", "comment": null, "summary": "The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for\ndata-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its\nvalidity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary\npost-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of\ntrajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately\ncaptures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations.\nLeveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV\noperations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across\nthree representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized\nintersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging\nanalysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure\nnegligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we\napply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically\nestimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to\nquantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show\nthat behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably,\nWOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings\nsuggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically\nunderestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving.\nCaution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without\nproper validation against independently collected data."}
