Battery energy storage system (BESS) offers a\npromising solution to address these issues. This paper presents a stochastic\ndynamic economic dispatch with storage (SDED-S) framework to assess the impact\nof BESS in managing uncertainty. The temporal correlation between wind and load\nuncertainties is captured, with scenarios generated using a method inspired by\nstratified and importance sampling. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a\nmodified IEEE 39-bus system, where selected conventional generators are\nconverted to wind power plants. Case studies show that strategic BESS\ndeployment significantly improves system flexibility by reducing renewable\ncurtailments and dispatch costs. Renewable energy curtailments decrease upon\nincreasing BESS size and approach zero depending on wind penetration level.\nHigher wind penetrations result in greater curtailments without storage and\nyield larger cost savings when BESS is deployed, highlighting the growing need\nfor flexibility as renewable energy penetrations increase."}

To this end, we develop\na new filter that exhibits favorable numerical properties, thereby correcting\nthe divergences observed in previous Kalman filter variants. In this\nformulation, the achievable precision is no longer constrained by the\nsmall-velocity assumption and is determined solely by sensor noise. In\naddition, this new filter assumes high precision on the sensors, which, in real\nscenarios require a detection step that we define heuristically, allowing one\nto extend this approach to scenarios, using either a 9-axis IMU or a\ncombination of odometry, accelerometer, and pressure sensors.

Ennea-Graphene, a new 2D carbon allotrope made of 4-, 5-,\n6-, and mainly 9-membered carbon rings (nonagons), is introduced via Density\nFunctional Theory (DFT) calculations. Phonon dispersion and ab initio molecular\ndynamics demonstrate that the monolayer is mechanically and dynamically stable\nat 300 K, as no imaginary modes are detected. The pristine system further\nexhibits metallic-like electronic behavior. The material exhibits high in-plane\nstiffness (Young modulus of 255 N/m). Sodium adsorption at the centers of the\nnonagonal rings is energetically favorable, with a binding energy of\napproximately -1.56 eV, leading to the formation of the Na@Ennea-Graphene\ncomplex. The calculated H2 adsorption energies range from -0.15 eV to -0.18 eV.\nThe Na-decorated structure demonstrates excellent hydrogen storage performance,\nreversibly adsorbing up to four H2 molecules per Na atom (8.8 wt\\% H2). This\ncapacity surpasses the U.S. Department of Energy's 2025 target for onboard\nhydrogen storage materials. The adsorbed H2 remains molecular (H-H bond of\n0.76~\\AA) and can be released under near-ambient conditions, as verified by 300\nK ab initio molecular dynamics simulations.

By converting\ntime-series data into a textual representation and designing domain-informed\nprompt templates, SPADE identifies irrigation events, estimates net irrigation\ngains, detects, classifies anomalies, and produces structured, interpretable\nreports. Experiments were conducted on real-world soil moisture sensor data\nfrom commercial and experimental farms cultivating multiple crops across the\nUnited States.

Although intermittent faults pose substantial challenges to\nreliability and coordination, existing studies of fault tolerance in robot\nswarms focus instead on permanent faults. One reason for this is that\nintermittent faults are prohibitively difficult to detect in the fully\nself-organized ad-hoc networks typical of robot swarms, as their network\ntopologies are transient and often unpredictable. However, in the recently\nintroduced self-organizing nervous systems (SoNS) approach, robot swarms are\nable to self-organize persistent network structures for the first time, easing\nthe problem of detecting intermittent faults. To address intermittent faults in\nrobot swarms that have persistent networks, we propose a novel\nproactive-reactive strategy to detection and mitigation, based on\nself-organized backup layers and distributed consensus in a multiplex network.\nProactively, the robots self-organize dynamic backup paths before faults occur,\nadapting to changes in the primary network topology and the robots' relative\npositions.

We propose Scheduler-Driven Job\nAtomization (SJA), a new paradigm that establishes a bidirectional interaction\nbetween scheduler and jobs.

To address these\nlimitations, this paper introduces the Synthesizing Attitudes, Predicting\nActions (SAPA) framework, a hierarchical approach that uses Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to synthesize theory-grounded latent attitudes to predict\nridesourcing choices.

Recent studies suggest\nthat applying a large alternating electric field changes the oxide structure,\npotentially improving the performance of qubits and resonators. In this study,\nwe probe the effect of alternating bias at cryogenic temperatures on TLS\ndynamics within amorphous oxide parallel-plate capacitors operating in the\nstrongly coupled regime. We bias the TLSs in the capacitors using an electric\nfield. This allows us to spectroscopically image TLSs and extract their\ndensities and dipole moments. When an in-situ alternating bias is applied, the\nsteady-state spectra from the standard TLS model disappear. Post-alternating\nbias TLS spectroscopy reveals transient behavior, in which the TLS frequency\nfluctuates on the order of minutes. Thermal cycling above 10 K reverses these\neffects, restoring the TLS spectrum to its original state, indicating a\nreversible mechanism.

Their appeal stems from\ndistinct advantages they hold over traditional inorganic semiconductors. Unlike\ninorganic semiconductors, where electrons are often considered to be in\ndelocalized, free, or quasi-free states (as described by Bloch's theory),\nelectrons in conjugated polymers behave differently. They are strongly coupled\nwithin highly localized $\\sigma$ or $\\pi$-orbitals and interact significantly\nwith the ionic cores.

Consequently, after nearly a\ncentury of applying Bloch's theory to the electronic transport properties of\ninorganic materials, there is a clear need for a new theoretical framework to\nexplain efficient charge transport in these organic solids.

Under IID\nsettings, FedAvg achieves superior performance to centralized models using the\nsame neural network. However, performance degrades with non-IID data and system\nheterogeneity. FedAvgM consistently outperforms FedAvg in heterogeneous\nsettings, showing better convergence and higher anomaly detection accuracy.

Although intermittent faults pose substantial challenges to\nreliability and coordination, existing studies of fault tolerance in robot\nswarms focus instead on permanent faults. One reason for this is that\nintermittent faults are prohibitively difficult to detect in the fully\nself-organized ad-hoc networks typical of robot swarms, as their network\ntopologies are transient and often unpredictable. However, in the recently\nintroduced self-organizing nervous systems (SoNS) approach, robot swarms are\nable to self-organize persistent network structures for the first time, easing\nthe problem of detecting intermittent faults. To address intermittent faults in\nrobot swarms that have persistent networks, we propose a novel\nproactive-reactive strategy to detection and mitigation, based on\nself-organized backup layers and distributed consensus in a multiplex network.\nProactively, the robots self-organize dynamic backup paths before faults occur,\nadapting to changes in the primary network topology and the robots' relative\npositions. Reactively, robots use one-shot likelihood ratio tests to compare\ninformation received along different paths in the multiplex network, enabling\nearly fault detection. Upon detection, communication is temporarily rerouted in\na self-organized way, until the detected fault resolves. We validate the\napproach in representative scenarios of faulty positional data occurring during\nformation control, demonstrating that intermittent faults are prevented from\ndisrupting convergence to desired formations, with high fault detection\naccuracy and low rates of false positives."}

To prevent transferring task-irrelevant noise through the\nshared pathway, we integrate a task-aware discriminator within a GAN. The\ndiscriminator encourages the shared expert to pass only task-aligned\ninformation during sequential training.

Using molecular simulations, this\nstudy investigates the swelling behavior and mechanical properties of sodium\nmontmorillonite (Mt), a common smectite clay, under varying hydration states\nand interlayer H_2 contents. Results show that H_2 accelerates hydration-state\ntransitions, narrows the stability window of crystalline swelling, and promotes\nasymmetric plume formation in confined interlayers. H_2 alters cation and water\ncoordination, thereby weakening Na^+--Mt electrostatic interactions and\nmodulating H-bond networks at the interface and in the bulk.

In-plane stiffness is mainly\ngoverned by basal spacing expansion, whereas out-of-plane stiffness is highly\nsensitive to the initial presence of water or H_2, which weaken interlayer\ncohesion.

Bi-VLA overcomes this limitation by utilizing robot\njoint angle, velocity, and torque data from leader-follower bilateral control\nwith visual features and natural language instructions through SigLIP and\nFiLM-based fusion. We validated Bi-VLA on two task types: one requiring\nsupplementary language cues and another distinguishable solely by vision.\nReal-robot experiments showed that Bi-VLA successfully interprets\nvision-language combinations and improves task success rates compared to\nconventional bilateral control-based imitation learning.

However, research on how\nto achieve domain adaptation in practical scenarios where source domain data is\ninaccessible namely, source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) remains limited.\nSelf-training has been widely used in SFDA, which requires obtaining as many\nhigh-quality pseudo-labels as possible to train models on target domain data.\nMost existing methods optimize the entire pseudo-label set to obtain more\nsupervisory information. However, as pseudo-label sets often contain\nsubstantial noise, simultaneously optimizing all labels is challenging. This\nlimitation undermines the effectiveness of optimization approaches and thus\nrestricts the performance of self-training. To address this, we propose a novel\npseudo-label optimization framework called Diffusion-Guided Label Enrichment\n(DGLE), which starts from a few easily obtained high-quality pseudo-labels and\npropagates them to a complete set of pseudo-labels while ensuring the quality\nof newly generated labels. Firstly, a pseudo-label fusion method based on\nconfidence filtering and super-resolution enhancement is proposed, which\nutilizes cross-validation of details and contextual information to obtain a\nsmall number of high-quality pseudo-labels as initial seeds. Then, we leverage\nthe diffusion model to propagate incomplete seed pseudo-labels with irregular\ndistributions due to its strong denoising capability for randomly distributed\nnoise and powerful modeling capacity for complex distributions, thereby\ngenerating complete and high-quality pseudo-labels. This method effectively\navoids the difficulty of directly optimizing the complete set of pseudo-labels,\nsignificantly improves the quality of pseudo-labels, and thus enhances the\nmodel's performance in the target domain."}

As a result,\nLongCat-Flash-Thinking achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source\nmodels on a suite of complex reasoning tasks. The model exhibits exceptional\nefficiency in agentic reasoning, reducing average token consumption by 64.5%\n(from 19, 653 to 6, 965) on AIME-25, without degrading task accuracy. We\nrelease LongCat-Flash-Thinking to promote further advances in reasoning systems\nand agentic AI research."}

Although intermittent faults pose substantial challenges to\nreliability and coordination, existing studies of fault tolerance in robot\nswarms focus instead on permanent faults. One reason for this is that\nintermittent faults are prohibitively difficult to detect in the fully\nself-organized ad-hoc networks typical of robot swarms, as their network\ntopologies are transient and often unpredictable. However, in the recently\nintroduced self-organizing nervous systems (SoNS) approach, robot swarms are\nable to self-organize persistent network structures for the first time, easing\nthe problem of detecting intermittent faults. To address intermittent faults in\nrobot swarms that have persistent networks, we propose a novel\nproactive-reactive strategy to detection and mitigation, based on\nself-organized backup layers and distributed consensus in a multiplex network.\nProactively, the robots self-organize dynamic backup paths before faults occur,\nadapting to changes in the primary network topology and the robots' relative\npositions. Reactively, robots use one-shot likelihood ratio tests to compare\ninformation received along different paths in the multiplex network, enabling\nearly fault detection. Upon detection, communication is temporarily rerouted in\na self-organized way, until the detected fault resolves. We validate the\napproach in representative scenarios of faulty positional data occurring during\nformation control, demonstrating that intermittent faults are prevented from\ndisrupting convergence to desired formations, with high fault detection\naccuracy and low rates of false positives."}

While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)\nrely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this\ndependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data.\nSpecifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the\npolicy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the\npreceding context.

However, existing diffusion models for time series generation require\nretraining the entire framework to introduce specific conditional guidance.\nThere also exists a certain degree of distributional bias between the generated\ndata and the real data, which leads to potential model biases in downstream\ntasks. Additionally, the complexity of diffusion models and the latent spaces\nleads to an uninterpretable inference process. To address these issues, we\npropose the data style-guided diffusion model (DS-Diffusion). In the\nDS-Diffusion, a diffusion framework based on style-guided kernels is developed\nto avoid retraining for specific conditions. The time-information based\nhierarchical denoising mechanism (THD) is developed to reduce the\ndistributional bias between the generated data and the real data. Furthermore,\nthe generated samples can clearly indicate the data style from which they\noriginate. We conduct comprehensive evaluations using multiple public datasets\nto validate our approach. Experimental results show that, compared to the\nstate-of-the-art model such as ImagenTime, the predictive score and the\ndiscriminative score decrease by 5.56% and 61.55%, respectively. The\ndistributional bias between the generated data and the real data is further\nreduced, the inference process is also more interpretable.

In\nthis work, we formally establish a generalized bisimulation metric (GBSM)\nbetween pairs of MDPs, which is rigorously proven with the three fundamental\nproperties: GBSM symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and the distance\nbound on identical state spaces. Leveraging these properties, we theoretically\nanalyse policy transfer, state aggregation, and sampling-based estimation in\nMDPs, obtaining explicit bounds that are strictly tighter than those derived\nfrom the standard BSM. Additionally, GBSM provides a closed-form sample\ncomplexity for estimation, improving upon existing asymptotic results based on\nBSM. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the\neffectiveness of GBSM in multi-MDP scenarios."}

Existing\nsolutions mainly focus on handling mirror surfaces through symmetry mapping but\noften overlook the rich information carried by mirror reflections. These\nreflections offer complementary perspectives that can fill in absent details\nand significantly enhance reconstruction quality. To advance 3D reconstruction\nin mirror-rich environments, we present MirrorScene3D, a comprehensive dataset\nfeaturing diverse indoor scenes, 1256 high-quality images, and annotated mirror\nmasks, providing a benchmark for evaluating reconstruction methods in\nreflective settings. Building on this, we propose ReflectiveGS, an extension of\n3D Gaussian Splatting that utilizes mirror reflections as complementary\nviewpoints rather than simple symmetry artifacts, enhancing scene geometry and\nrecovering absent details.

Our method is named Single Shot Decomposition Network (SSDnet). Our key\nassumption is that natural images often exhibit unified textures and patterns,\nand that anomalies manifest as localized deviations from these repetitive or\nstochastic patterns. To learn the deep image prior, we design a patch-based\ntraining framework where the input image is fed directly into the network for\nself-reconstruction, rather than mapping random noise to the image as done in\nDIP. To avoid the model simply learning an identity mapping, we apply masking,\npatch shuffling, and small Gaussian noise.

To address\nthese issues, we propose DyL-UNet, a dynamic learning-based temporal\nconsistency U-Net segmentation architecture designed to achieve temporally\nstable and precise echocardiographic segmentation. The framework constructs an\nEcho-Dynamics Graph (EDG) through dynamic learning to extract dynamic\ninformation from videos. DyL-UNet incorporates multiple Swin-Transformer-based\nencoder-decoder branches for processing single-frame images. It further\nintroduces Cardiac Phase-Dynamics Attention (CPDA) at the skip connections,\nwhich uses EDG-encoded dynamic features and cardiac-phase cues to enforce\ntemporal consistency during segmentation. Extensive experiments on the CAMUS\nand EchoNet-Dynamic datasets demonstrate that DyL-UNet maintains segmentation\naccuracy comparable to existing methods while achieving superior temporal\nconsistency, providing a reliable solution for automated clinical\nechocardiography."}

These have proven effective\nacross diverse domains, including healthcare, bioinformatics and economics. The\nstructure and parameters of a BN can be obtained by domain experts or directly\nlearned from available data. However, as privacy concerns escalate, it becomes\nincreasingly critical for publicly released models to safeguard sensitive\ninformation in training data. Typically, released models do not prioritize\nprivacy by design. In particular, tracing attacks from adversaries can combine\nthe released BN with auxiliary data to determine whether specific individuals\nbelong to the data from which the BN was learned. State-of-the-art protection\ntecniques involve introducing noise into the learned parameters. While this\noffers robust protection against tracing attacks, it significantly impacts the\nmodel's utility, in terms of both the significance and accuracy of the\nresulting inferences. Hence, high privacy may be attained at the cost of\nreleasing a possibly ineffective model. This paper introduces credal networks\n(CN) as a novel solution for balancing the model's privacy and utility. After\nadapting the notion of tracing attacks, we demonstrate that a CN enables the\nmasking of the learned BN, thereby reducing the probability of successful\nattacks. As CNs are obfuscated but not noisy versions of BNs, they can achieve\nmeaningful inferences while safeguarding privacy. Moreover, we identify key\nlearning information that must be concealed to prevent attackers from\nrecovering the underlying BN. Finally, we conduct a set of numerical\nexperiments to analyze how privacy gains can be modulated by tuning the CN\nhyperparameters. Our results confirm that CNs provide a principled, practical,\nand effective approach towards the development of privacy-aware probabilistic\ngraphical models."}

To meet the\ncommunity's growing RL needs, numerous RL frameworks have been proposed.

Contrary to the \"longer-is-better\" narrative, we find\nthat both naive CoT lengthening and increased review are associated with\n*lower* accuracy.\n  As CoT unfolds step by step, token-level metrics can conflate verbosity with\nprocess quality. We introduce a graph view of CoT to extract structure and\nidentify a single statistic-the *Failed-Step Fraction (FSF)*, the fraction of\nsteps in abandoned branches-that consistently outpredicts length and review\nratio for correctness across models. To probe causality, we design two\ninterventions. First, we rank candidate CoTs by each metric at test time, where\nFSF yields the largest pass@1 gains; second, we edit CoTs to remove failed\nbranches, which significantly improves accuracy, indicating that failed\nbranches bias subsequent reasoning. Taken together, these results characterize\neffective CoTs as those that *fail less* and support *structure-aware*\ntest-time scaling over indiscriminately generating long CoT."}

An Comprehensive End-to-End Simulation Automation:\nFoam-Agent is the first system to manage the full simulation pipeline,\nincluding advanced pre-processing with a versatile Meshing Agent capable of\nhandling external mesh files and generating new geometries via Gmsh, automatic\ngeneration of HPC submission scripts, and post-simulation visualization via\nParaView. 2. Composable Service Architecture: Going beyond a monolithic agent,\nthe framework uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) to expose its core functions as\ndiscrete, callable tools. This allows for flexible integration and use by other\nagentic systems, such as Claude-code, for more exploratory workflows. 3.\nHigh-Fidelity Configuration Generation: We achieve superior accuracy through a\nHierarchical Multi-Index RAG for precise context retrieval and a\ndependency-aware generation process that ensures configuration consistency.\nEvaluated on a benchmark of 110 simulation tasks, Foam-Agent achieves an 88.2%\nsuccess rate with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, significantly outperforming existing\nframeworks (55.5% for MetaOpenFOAM).

To address these\nlimitations, this paper introduces the Synthesizing Attitudes, Predicting\nActions (SAPA) framework, a hierarchical approach that uses Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to synthesize theory-grounded latent attitudes to predict\nridesourcing choices.

Second, these degraded\nregions can disrupt accurate pixel correspondences, leading to ineffective\nsupervision based on the photometric consistency assumption.

While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)\nrely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this\ndependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data.\nSpecifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the\npolicy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the\npreceding context.

Extensive\nexperiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across\nmultiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied\nto Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$,\n$6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and\nAIME25, respectively.

It can be seamlessly integrated with\narbitrary policy models as a plug-in module, augmenting exploration without\ndegrading the base policy performance. Moreover, the structured latent space\nenables human-guided exploration, further improving efficiency and\ncontrollability. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world tasks\ndemonstrate that SOE consistently outperforms prior methods, achieving higher\ntask success rates, smoother and safer exploration, and superior sample\nefficiency. These results establish on-manifold exploration as a principled\napproach to sample-efficient policy self-improvement. Project website:\nhttps://ericjin2002.github.io/SOE"}

Theoretical results\nhave formally proven that continuous tokens have much greater expressivity and\ncan solve specific problems more efficiently. However, practical use of\ncontinuous tokens has been limited by strong training difficulties: previous\nworks either just use continuous tokens at inference time on a pre-trained\ndiscrete-token model, or must distill the continuous CoT from ground-truth\ndiscrete CoTs and face computational costs that limit the CoT to very few\ntokens.\n  This is the first work introducing a scalable method to learn continuous CoTs\nvia reinforcement learning (RL), without distilling from reference discrete\nCoTs. We use \"soft\" tokens: mixtures of tokens together with noise on the input\nembedding to provide RL exploration. Computational overhead is minimal,\nenabling us to learn continuous CoTs with hundreds of tokens. On math reasoning\nbenchmarks with Llama and Qwen models up to 8B, training with continuous CoTs\nmatch discrete-token CoTs for pass@1 and surpass them for pass@32, showing\ngreater CoT diversity. In systematic comparisons, the best-performing scenario\nis to train with continuous CoT tokens then use discrete tokens for inference,\nmeaning the \"soft\" models can be deployed in a standard way. Finally, we show\ncontinuous CoT RL training better preserves the predictions of the base model\non out-of-domain tasks, thus providing a softer touch to the base model."}

In the\ncorrupted data setting, the adversary instead replaces values arbitrarily, and\nthe corruption locations are unknown to the learner. Despite substantial work\non missing data, linear regression under such adversarial missingness remains\npoorly understood, even information-theoretically. Unlike the clean setting,\nwhere estimation error vanishes with more samples, here the optimal error\nremains a positive function of the problem parameters. Our main contribution is\nto characterize this error up to constant factors across essentially the entire\nparameter range. Specifically, we establish novel information-theoretic lower\nbounds on the achievable error that match the error of (computationally\nefficient) algorithms. A key implication is that, perhaps surprisingly, the\noptimal error in the missing data setting matches that in the corruption\nsetting-so knowing the corruption locations offers no general advantage."}

To address\nthis challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data\n(RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast\nto prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning,\nRLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to\nlearn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement\nlearning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)\nrely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this\ndependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data.\nSpecifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the\npolicy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the\npreceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training\ndata, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader\ncontexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive\nexperiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across\nmultiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied\nto Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$,\n$6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and\nAIME25, respectively. The results further demonstrate favorable scaling\nbehavior, suggesting strong potential for continued gains with more compute. In\naddition, RLPT provides a solid foundation, extending the reasoning boundaries\nof LLMs and enhancing RLVR performance."}

In comparison, reinforcement\nlearning (RL) trains an agent through autonomous interaction with the\nenvironment and has shown remarkable success in various domains. Still,\ntraining RL policies directly on real-world robots remains challenging due to\nsample inefficiency, safety concerns, and the difficulty of learning from\nsparse rewards for long-horizon tasks, especially for high-degree-of-freedom\n(DoF) systems.
