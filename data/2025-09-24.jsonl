Battery energy storage system (BESS) offers a\npromising solution to address these issues. This paper presents a stochastic\ndynamic economic dispatch with storage (SDED-S) framework to assess the impact\nof BESS in managing uncertainty. The temporal correlation between wind and load\nuncertainties is captured, with scenarios generated using a method inspired by\nstratified and importance sampling. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a\nmodified IEEE 39-bus system, where selected conventional generators are\nconverted to wind power plants. Case studies show that strategic BESS\ndeployment significantly improves system flexibility by reducing renewable\ncurtailments and dispatch costs. Renewable energy curtailments decrease upon\nincreasing BESS size and approach zero depending on wind penetration level.\nHigher wind penetrations result in greater curtailments without storage and\nyield larger cost savings when BESS is deployed, highlighting the growing need\nfor flexibility as renewable energy penetrations increase."}

To this end, we develop\na new filter that exhibits favorable numerical properties, thereby correcting\nthe divergences observed in previous Kalman filter variants. In this\nformulation, the achievable precision is no longer constrained by the\nsmall-velocity assumption and is determined solely by sensor noise. In\naddition, this new filter assumes high precision on the sensors, which, in real\nscenarios require a detection step that we define heuristically, allowing one\nto extend this approach to scenarios, using either a 9-axis IMU or a\ncombination of odometry, accelerometer, and pressure sensors.

Ennea-Graphene, a new 2D carbon allotrope made of 4-, 5-,\n6-, and mainly 9-membered carbon rings (nonagons), is introduced via Density\nFunctional Theory (DFT) calculations. Phonon dispersion and ab initio molecular\ndynamics demonstrate that the monolayer is mechanically and dynamically stable\nat 300 K, as no imaginary modes are detected. The pristine system further\nexhibits metallic-like electronic behavior. The material exhibits high in-plane\nstiffness (Young modulus of 255 N/m). Sodium adsorption at the centers of the\nnonagonal rings is energetically favorable, with a binding energy of\napproximately -1.56 eV, leading to the formation of the Na@Ennea-Graphene\ncomplex. The calculated H2 adsorption energies range from -0.15 eV to -0.18 eV.\nThe Na-decorated structure demonstrates excellent hydrogen storage performance,\nreversibly adsorbing up to four H2 molecules per Na atom (8.8 wt\\% H2). This\ncapacity surpasses the U.S. Department of Energy's 2025 target for onboard\nhydrogen storage materials. The adsorbed H2 remains molecular (H-H bond of\n0.76~\\AA) and can be released under near-ambient conditions, as verified by 300\nK ab initio molecular dynamics simulations.

By converting\ntime-series data into a textual representation and designing domain-informed\nprompt templates, SPADE identifies irrigation events, estimates net irrigation\ngains, detects, classifies anomalies, and produces structured, interpretable\nreports. Experiments were conducted on real-world soil moisture sensor data\nfrom commercial and experimental farms cultivating multiple crops across the\nUnited States.

Although intermittent faults pose substantial challenges to\nreliability and coordination, existing studies of fault tolerance in robot\nswarms focus instead on permanent faults. One reason for this is that\nintermittent faults are prohibitively difficult to detect in the fully\nself-organized ad-hoc networks typical of robot swarms, as their network\ntopologies are transient and often unpredictable. However, in the recently\nintroduced self-organizing nervous systems (SoNS) approach, robot swarms are\nable to self-organize persistent network structures for the first time, easing\nthe problem of detecting intermittent faults. To address intermittent faults in\nrobot swarms that have persistent networks, we propose a novel\nproactive-reactive strategy to detection and mitigation, based on\nself-organized backup layers and distributed consensus in a multiplex network.\nProactively, the robots self-organize dynamic backup paths before faults occur,\nadapting to changes in the primary network topology and the robots' relative\npositions.

To address these\nlimitations, this paper introduces the Synthesizing Attitudes, Predicting\nActions (SAPA) framework, a hierarchical approach that uses Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to synthesize theory-grounded latent attitudes to predict\nridesourcing choices. SAPA first uses an LLM to generate qualitative traveler\npersonas from raw travel survey data and then trains a propensity-score model\non demographic and behavioral features, enriched by those personas, to produce\nan individual-level score.

Recent studies suggest\nthat applying a large alternating electric field changes the oxide structure,\npotentially improving the performance of qubits and resonators. In this study,\nwe probe the effect of alternating bias at cryogenic temperatures on TLS\ndynamics within amorphous oxide parallel-plate capacitors operating in the\nstrongly coupled regime. We bias the TLSs in the capacitors using an electric\nfield. This allows us to spectroscopically image TLSs and extract their\ndensities and dipole moments. When an in-situ alternating bias is applied, the\nsteady-state spectra from the standard TLS model disappear. Post-alternating\nbias TLS spectroscopy reveals transient behavior, in which the TLS frequency\nfluctuates on the order of minutes. Thermal cycling above 10 K reverses these\neffects, restoring the TLS spectrum to its original state, indicating a\nreversible mechanism.

Unlike\ninorganic semiconductors, where electrons are often considered to be in\ndelocalized, free, or quasi-free states (as described by Bloch's theory),\nelectrons in conjugated polymers behave differently.

It detects 181 emboli with 49 false positives and 28 false\nnegatives from 60 in-house testing scans. Its generalizability is further\nvalidated on public datasets."}

Although intermittent faults pose substantial challenges to\nreliability and coordination, existing studies of fault tolerance in robot\nswarms focus instead on permanent faults. One reason for this is that\nintermittent faults are prohibitively difficult to detect in the fully\nself-organized ad-hoc networks typical of robot swarms, as their network\ntopologies are transient and often unpredictable. However, in the recently\nintroduced self-organizing nervous systems (SoNS) approach, robot swarms are\nable to self-organize persistent network structures for the first time, easing\nthe problem of detecting intermittent faults. To address intermittent faults in\nrobot swarms that have persistent networks, we propose a novel\nproactive-reactive strategy to detection and mitigation, based on\nself-organized backup layers and distributed consensus in a multiplex network.\nProactively, the robots self-organize dynamic backup paths before faults occur,\nadapting to changes in the primary network topology and the robots' relative\npositions. Reactively, robots use one-shot likelihood ratio tests to compare\ninformation received along different paths in the multiplex network, enabling\nearly fault detection. Upon detection, communication is temporarily rerouted in\na self-organized way, until the detected fault resolves. We validate the\napproach in representative scenarios of faulty positional data occurring during\nformation control, demonstrating that intermittent faults are prevented from\ndisrupting convergence to desired formations, with high fault detection\naccuracy and low rates of false positives."}

Simulators provide safe, scalable training\nenvironments, but the inevitable sim-to-real gap introduces additional safety\nconcerns, as policies must satisfy constraints in real-world conditions that\ndiffer from simulation. To address this challenge, robust safe RL techniques\noffer principled methods, but are often incompatible with standard scalable\ntraining pipelines. In contrast, domain randomization, a simple and popular\nsim-to-real technique, stands out as a promising alternative, although it often\nresults in unsafe behaviors in practice. We present SPiDR, short for\nSim-to-real via Pessimistic Domain Randomization -- a scalable algorithm with\nprovable guarantees for safe sim-to-real transfer.

Using molecular simulations, this\nstudy investigates the swelling behavior and mechanical properties of sodium\nmontmorillonite (Mt), a common smectite clay, under varying hydration states\nand interlayer H_2 contents. Results show that H_2 accelerates hydration-state\ntransitions, narrows the stability window of crystalline swelling, and promotes\nasymmetric plume formation in confined interlayers. H_2 alters cation and water\ncoordination, thereby weakening Na^+--Mt electrostatic interactions and\nmodulating H-bond networks at the interface and in the bulk.

We bias the TLSs in the capacitors using an electric\nfield. This allows us to spectroscopically image TLSs and extract their\ndensities and dipole moments. When an in-situ alternating bias is applied, the\nsteady-state spectra from the standard TLS model disappear. Post-alternating\nbias TLS spectroscopy reveals transient behavior, in which the TLS frequency\nfluctuates on the order of minutes. Thermal cycling above 10 K reverses these\neffects, restoring the TLS spectrum to its original state, indicating a\nreversible mechanism. Importantly, the intrinsic loss tangent of the LC\noscillator remains unchanged before and after the application of the\nalternating bias. We propose that the disappearance of the steady-state\nspectrum are caused by non-equilibrium energy build up from strain in the oxide\nfilm introduced by the pulsed voltage bias sequence. Understanding this\nnon-equilibrium energy could inform future models of time-dependent TLS\ndynamics."}

In\nthis paper, we propose variational task vector composition, where composition\ncoefficients are taken as latent variables and estimated in a Bayesian\ninference framework. Unlike previous methods that operate at the task level,\nour framework focuses on sample-specific composition. Motivated by the\nobservation of structural redundancy in task vectors, we introduce a\nSpike-and-Slab prior that promotes sparsity and preserves only the most\ninformative components. To further address the high variance and sampling\ninefficiency in sparse, high-dimensional spaces, we develop a gated sampling\nmechanism that constructs a controllable posterior by filtering the composition\ncoefficients based on both uncertainty and importance. This yields a more\nstable and interpretable variational framework by deterministically selecting\nreliable task components, reducing sampling variance while improving\ntransparency and generalization.

Although intermittent faults pose substantial challenges to\nreliability and coordination, existing studies of fault tolerance in robot\nswarms focus instead on permanent faults. One reason for this is that\nintermittent faults are prohibitively difficult to detect in the fully\nself-organized ad-hoc networks typical of robot swarms, as their network\ntopologies are transient and often unpredictable. However, in the recently\nintroduced self-organizing nervous systems (SoNS) approach, robot swarms are\nable to self-organize persistent network structures for the first time, easing\nthe problem of detecting intermittent faults. To address intermittent faults in\nrobot swarms that have persistent networks, we propose a novel\nproactive-reactive strategy to detection and mitigation, based on\nself-organized backup layers and distributed consensus in a multiplex network.\nProactively, the robots self-organize dynamic backup paths before faults occur,\nadapting to changes in the primary network topology and the robots' relative\npositions. Reactively, robots use one-shot likelihood ratio tests to compare\ninformation received along different paths in the multiplex network, enabling\nearly fault detection. Upon detection, communication is temporarily rerouted in\na self-organized way, until the detected fault resolves. We validate the\napproach in representative scenarios of faulty positional data occurring during\nformation control, demonstrating that intermittent faults are prevented from\ndisrupting convergence to desired formations, with high fault detection\naccuracy and low rates of false positives."}

Current self-reflection practices rely on heuristic prompts\nor one-way reasoning: the model is urged to 'think more' instead of learning\nerror diagnosis and repair. This is fragile in multi-turn interactions; after a\nfailure the model often repeats the same mistake. We propose structured\nreflection, which turns the path from error to repair into an explicit,\ncontrollable, and trainable action. The agent produces a short yet precise\nreflection: it diagnoses the failure using evidence from the previous step and\nthen proposes a correct, executable follow-up call. For training we combine\nDAPO and GSPO objectives with a reward scheme tailored to tool use, optimizing\nthe stepwise strategy Reflect, then Call, then Final. To evaluate, we introduce\nTool-Reflection-Bench, a lightweight benchmark that programmatically checks\nstructural validity, executability, parameter correctness, and result\nconsistency.

We explore an\nalternative paradigm: treating the LLM as a reward model of KG reasoning paths,\nwhere the model learns to judge whether a candidate path leads to correct\ndiagnosis for a given patient input. This approach is inspired by recent work\nthat leverages reward training to enhance model reasoning abilities, and\ngrounded in computational theory, which suggests that verifying a solution is\noften easier than generating one from scratch.

This\npaper addresses this limitation by constructing powerful MoE models using\nexperts sourced from multiple identically-architected but disparate pre-trained\nmodels (e.g., Llama2-Chat and Code Llama). A key challenge lies in the fact\nthat these source models occupy disparate, dissonant regions of the parameter\nspace, making direct upcycling prone to severe performance degradation.

Remarkably, the impact of the LRSs is captured\nthrough an explicit convolution-type functional term, making their effects\nfully tractable. To illustrate the utility of FSL, we analyze three widely used\nLRSs -- constant, exponential decay, and warmup-stable-decay (WSD) -- under\nboth data-limited and compute-limited regimes. We provide theoretical\njustification for widely adopted empirical practices in LLMs pre-training such\nas (i) higher-capacity models are more data- and compute-efficient; (ii)\nlearning rate decay can improve training efficiency; (iii) WSD-like schedules\ncan outperform direct-decay schedules. Lastly, we explore the practical\nrelevance of FSL as a surrogate model for fitting, predicting and optimizing\nthe loss curves in LLM pre-training, with experiments conducted across model\nsizes ranging from 0.1B to 1B parameters. We hope our FSL framework can deepen\nthe understanding of LLM pre-training dynamics and provide insights for\nimproving large-scale model training."}

By converting\ntime-series data into a textual representation and designing domain-informed\nprompt templates, SPADE identifies irrigation events, estimates net irrigation\ngains, detects, classifies anomalies, and produces structured, interpretable\nreports. Experiments were conducted on real-world soil moisture sensor data\nfrom commercial and experimental farms cultivating multiple crops across the\nUnited States. Results demonstrate that SPADE outperforms the existing method\nin anomaly detection, achieving higher recall and F1 scores and accurately\nclassifying anomaly types. Furthermore, SPADE achieved high precision and\nrecall in detecting irrigation events, indicating its strong capability to\ncapture irrigation patterns accurately. SPADE's reports provide\ninterpretability and usability of soil moisture analytics. This study\nhighlights the potential of LLMs as scalable, adaptable tools for precision\nagriculture, which is capable of integrating qualitative knowledge and\ndata-driven reasoning to produce actionable insights for accurate soil moisture\nmonitoring and improved irrigation scheduling from soil moisture time-series\ndata."}

To make policies pose-aware and category-general, we perform functional\nobject canonicalization for functional alignment and automatic manipulation\ntrajectory transfer, mapping objects into shared functional frames using\naffordance cues from large vision language models. An object centric and action\ncentric diffusion policy FuncDiffuser trained on this aligned data naturally\nrespects object affordances and poses, simplifying learning and improving\ngeneralization ability. Experiments on simulated and real-world benchmarks\ndemonstrate category-level generalization, cross-task behavior reuse, and\nrobust sim2real deployment, showing that functional canonicalization provides a\nstrong inductive bias for scalable imitation learning in complex manipulation\ndomains.

The approach models the reasoning\nof an LLM as an iterative decision process, where the model dynamically selects\namong cognitive operations such as reasoning, revision, personalization, and\nclarification. This enables exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories,\nproducing diverse candidate responses that capture different perspectives. PoT\nthen aggregates and reweights these candidates according to inferred user\npreferences, yielding a final personalized response that benefits from the\ncomplementary strengths of diverse reasoning paths. Experiments on the LaMP-QA\nbenchmark for personalized QA show that PoT consistently outperforms\ncompetitive baselines, achieving up to a 13.1% relative improvement. Human\nevaluation corroborates these results, with annotators preferring outputs from\nPoT in 66% of cases and reporting ties in only 15% of cases."}

First, adverse weather introduces\nnoise and reduces visibility, making CNN-based feature extractors struggle with\ndegraded regions like reflective and textureless areas. Second, these degraded\nregions can disrupt accurate pixel correspondences, leading to ineffective\nsupervision based on the photometric consistency assumption. To address these\nchallenges, we propose injecting robust priors derived from the visual\nfoundation model into the CNN-based feature extractor to improve feature\nrepresentation under adverse weather conditions.

Moreover, the training process\ntends to exhibit strong randomness and slow convergence. It often requires\nconsiderable time or high computational resources. Another class of\nlearning-based method incorporates Lyapunov stability theory to obtain a\ncontrol policy with stability guarantees. However, these methods generally\nrequire an initially stable neural network control policy at the beginning of\ntraining. Evidently, a stable neural network controller can not only serve as\nan initial policy for reinforcement learning, allowing the training to focus on\nimproving controller performance, but also act as an initial state for\nlearning-based Lyapunov control methods. Although stable controllers can be\ndesigned using traditional control theory, designers still need to have a great\ndeal of control design knowledge to address increasingly complicated control\nproblems. The proposed neural network rapid initialization method in this paper\nachieves the initial training of the neural network control policy by\nconstructing datasets that conform to the stability conditions based on the\nsystem model. Furthermore, using the image-based visual servoing control for\nmulticopter interception as a case study, simulations and experiments were\nconducted to validate the effectiveness and practical performance of the\nproposed method. In the experiment, the trained control policy attains a final\ninterception velocity of 15 m/s."}

Theoretical results\nhave formally proven that continuous tokens have much greater expressivity and\ncan solve specific problems more efficiently. However, practical use of\ncontinuous tokens has been limited by strong training difficulties: previous\nworks either just use continuous tokens at inference time on a pre-trained\ndiscrete-token model, or must distill the continuous CoT from ground-truth\ndiscrete CoTs and face computational costs that limit the CoT to very few\ntokens.\n  This is the first work introducing a scalable method to learn continuous CoTs\nvia reinforcement learning (RL), without distilling from reference discrete\nCoTs. We use \"soft\" tokens: mixtures of tokens together with noise on the input\nembedding to provide RL exploration. Computational overhead is minimal,\nenabling us to learn continuous CoTs with hundreds of tokens. On math reasoning\nbenchmarks with Llama and Qwen models up to 8B, training with continuous CoTs\nmatch discrete-token CoTs for pass@1 and surpass them for pass@32, showing\ngreater CoT diversity. In systematic comparisons, the best-performing scenario\nis to train with continuous CoT tokens then use discrete tokens for inference,\nmeaning the \"soft\" models can be deployed in a standard way. Finally, we show\ncontinuous CoT RL training better preserves the predictions of the base model\non out-of-domain tasks, thus providing a softer touch to the base model."}

In the incomplete data setting, an adversary may\ninspect the dataset and delete entries in up to an $\\eta$-fraction of samples\nper coordinate; a strong form of the Missing Not At Random model. In the\ncorrupted data setting, the adversary instead replaces values arbitrarily, and\nthe corruption locations are unknown to the learner. Despite substantial work\non missing data, linear regression under such adversarial missingness remains\npoorly understood, even information-theoretically. Unlike the clean setting,\nwhere estimation error vanishes with more samples, here the optimal error\nremains a positive function of the problem parameters. Our main contribution is\nto characterize this error up to constant factors across essentially the entire\nparameter range. Specifically, we establish novel information-theoretic lower\nbounds on the achievable error that match the error of (computationally\nefficient) algorithms.

To address\nthis challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data\n(RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast\nto prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning,\nRLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to\nlearn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement\nlearning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)\nrely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this\ndependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data.\nSpecifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the\npolicy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the\npreceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training\ndata, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader\ncontexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive\nexperiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across\nmultiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied\nto Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$,\n$6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and\nAIME25, respectively. The results further demonstrate favorable scaling\nbehavior, suggesting strong potential for continued gains with more compute. In\naddition, RLPT provides a solid foundation, extending the reasoning boundaries\nof LLMs and enhancing RLVR performance."}
