However, existing dendrite-inspired neurons are mainly designed for static data. Studies on capturing dynamic features and modeling long-term dependencies in temporal sequences remain limited. Efficient architectures specifically designed for temporal sequence prediction are still lacking. In this paper, we propose Memory-DD, a low-complexity dendrite-inspired neuron model. Memory-DD consists of two dendrite-inspired neuron groups that contain no nonlinear activation functions but can still realize nonlinear mappings.

This design effectively captures temporal dependencies and is suitable for both classification and regression tasks on sequence data. Experimental results show that Memory-DD achieves an average accuracy of 89.41% on 18 temporal classification benchmark datasets, outperforming LSTM by 4.25%. On 9 temporal regression datasets, it reaches comparable performance to LSTM, while using only 50% of the parameters and reducing computational complexity (FLOPs) by 27.7%.

In this paper, we show that the low-rank ADI methods for Sylvester and Riccati equations are also Petrov-Galerkin projection algorithms that implicitly perform model order reduction. By observing that the ADI methods for Lyapunov, Sylvester, and Riccati equations differ only in pole placement and not in their interpolatory nature, we show that the shifted linear solves-which constitute the bulk of the computational cost-can be shared. The pole-placement step involves only small-scale operations and is therefore inexpensive. We propose a unified ADI framework that requires only two shifted linear solves per iteration to simultaneously solve six Lyapunov equations, one Sylvester equation, and ten Riccati equations, thus substantially increasing the return on investment for the computational cost spent on the linear solves. All operations needed to extract the individual solutions from these shared linear solves are small-scale and inexpensive.\n  Since all ADI methods implicitly perform model order reduction when solving these linear matrix equations, we show that the resulting reduced-order models can be obtained as an additional byproduct. These models not only interpolate the original transfer function at the mirror images of the ADI shifts but also preserve important system properties such as stability, minimum-phase property, positive-realness, bounded-realness, and passivity.

In this work, we present SPLICE, a novel part-level neural implicit representation of 3D shapes that enables intuitive, structure-aware, and high-fidelity shape editing. By encoding each shape part independently and positioning them using parameterized Gaussian ellipsoids, SPLICE effectively isolates part-specific features while discarding global context that may hinder flexible manipulation. A global attention-based decoder is then employed to integrate parts coherently, further enhanced by an attention-guiding filtering mechanism that prevents information leakage across symmetric or adjacent components. Through this architecture, SPLICE supports various part-level editing operations, including translation, rotation, scaling, deletion, duplication, and cross-shape part mixing. These operations enable users to flexibly explore design variations while preserving semantic consistency and maintaining structural plausibility.

This tradeoff was achieved in [KP19, GGHPV20] using the Fiat-Naor generic algorithm for Function Inversion. Consequently, [GGHPV20] asked whether this algorithm can be improved by leveraging the structure of 3SUM-Indexing.\n  In this paper, we exploit the structure of 3SUM-Indexing to give a time-space tradeoff of $T S = n^{2.5}$, which is better than the best known one in the range $n^{3/2} \\ll S \\ll n^{7/4}$.

Our categorization is based on optimization techniques, targeted objectives, and the strengths and limitations of each approach. In addition, we examine existing surveys and identify unresolved challenges and gaps in the literature. By highlighting the lack of synergy among fundamental resource management components, we outline promising research directions leveraging AI-driven optimization, quantum computing, and serverless computing.

Unfortunately, each switch is costly-adding time and space overhead and increasing the logical error rate. Minimizing the number of switching operations is, therefore, essential for quantum computations using code switching. In this work, we study the problem of minimizing the number of code switches required to run a given quantum circuit. We show that this problem can be solved efficiently in polynomial time by reducing it to a minimum-cut instance on a graph derived from the circuit. Our formulation is flexible and can incorporate additional considerations, such as reducing depth overhead by preferring switches during idle periods or biasing the compilation to favor one code over another.

Artificial variables embedded in the formulation ensure recursive feasibility and robust constraint satisfaction when the economic criterion is updated online, while guaranteeing convergence to the corresponding optimal periodic tube when the criterion remains constant.

This requires grounding language-based action queries to objects that both afford the requested function and can be physically retrieved. Existing approaches often rely on black-box models or fixed affordance labels, limiting transparency, controllability, and reliability for human-facing applications. We introduce CRAFT-E, a modular neuro-symbolic framework that composes a structured verb-property-object knowledge graph with visual-language alignment and energy-based grasp reasoning. The system generates interpretable grounding paths that expose the factors influencing object selection and incorporates grasp feasibility as an integral part of affordance inference. We further construct a benchmark dataset with unified annotations for verb-object compatibility, segmentation, and grasp candidates, and deploy the full pipeline on a physical robot. CRAFT-E achieves competitive performance in static scenes, ImageNet-based functional retrieval, and real-world trials involving 20 verbs and 39 objects. The framework remains robust under perceptual noise and provides transparent, component-level diagnostics.

While intended for computational optimization, scaling algorithms can be exploited to conceal malicious visual prompts that are invisible to human observers but become active semantic instructions once processed by the model. Current adversarial strategies remain largely static, failing to account for the dynamic nature of modern agentic workflows. To address this gap, we propose Chameleon, a novel, adaptive adversarial framework designed to expose and exploit scaling vulnerabilities in production VLMs. Unlike traditional static attacks, Chameleon employs an iterative, agent-based optimization mechanism that dynamically refines image perturbations based on the target model's real-time feedback. This allows the framework to craft highly robust adversarial examples that survive standard downscaling operations to hijack downstream execution. We evaluate Chameleon against Gemini 2.5 Flash model. Our experiments demonstrate that Chameleon achieves an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 84.5% across varying scaling factors, significantly outperforming static baseline attacks which average only 32.1%. Furthermore, we show that these attacks effectively compromise agentic pipelines, reducing decision-making accuracy by over 45% in multi-step tasks. Finally, we discuss the implications of these vulnerabilities and propose multi-scale consistency checks as a necessary defense mechanism.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Agentic intelligence endows distributed RAN entities with goal-driven autonomy, reasoning, planning, and multi-agent collaboration, increasingly supported by foundation models and knowledge graphs. In this work, we first introduce the conceptual foundations of SemCom and agentic networking, and discuss why existing AI-driven O-RAN solutions remain largely bit-centric and task-siloed. We then present a unified taxonomy that organizes recent research along three axes: i) semantic abstraction level (symbol/feature/intent/knowledge), ii) agent autonomy and coordination granularity (single-, multi-, and hierarchical-agent), and iii) RAN control placement across PHY/MAC, near-real-time RIC, and non-real-time RIC. Based on this taxonomy, we systematically introduce enabling technologies including task-oriented semantic encoders/decoders, multi-agent reinforcement learning, foundation-model-assisted RAN agents, and knowledge-graph-based reasoning for cross-layer awareness.

We propose reward-privileged world model distillation, a two-stage framework in which a teacher DreamerV3-style agent is first trained with a dense privileged reward, and only its latent dynamics are distilled into a student trained solely on sparse task rewards. Teacher and student share the same observation space (semantic bird's-eye-view images); privileged information enters only through the teacher's reward, and the student does not imitate the teacher's actions or value estimates. Instead, the student's world model is regularized to match the teacher's latent dynamics while its policy is learned from scratch on sparse success/failure signals. In CARLA lane-following and overtaking benchmarks, sparse-reward students outperform both dense-reward teachers and sparse-from-scratch baselines. On unseen lane-following routes, reward-privileged distillation improves success by about 23 percent relative to the dense teacher while maintaining comparable or better safety. On overtaking, students retain near-perfect performance on training routes and achieve up to a 27x improvement in success on unseen routes, with improved lane keeping.

However, the targeted synthesis of HEO materials is often hindered by competing stabilizing and destabilizing factors, which are difficult to predict. This work examines the effects of increased configurational entropy on the phase formation and stability of four notable complex oxide families: perovskite ($AB$O$_3$}), pyrochlore ($A_2B_2$O$_7$), Ruddlesden-Popper ($A_2B$O$_4$), and zirconium tungstate ($AB_2$O$_8$). Each of these structures has a tetravalent cation site, which we attempt to substitute with an entropic mixture of four cations, benchmarked by the parallel synthesis of a non-disordered reference compound. While all four target high entropy materials can be expected to form based on ionic radii criteria, only the high entropy perovskite Ba(Ti,Zr,Hf,Sn)O$_3$ is successfully synthesized. In the case of the pyrochlore, an entropy-stabilized defect fluorite is formed instead, while the Ruddlesden-Popper phase co-exists with multiple competing phases. For the tungstate, an unexpected deep eutectic point between the precursors results in melting that precedes the formation of a high entropy phase. Our case studies therefore illustrate that the stability of HEOs cannot be straightforwardly predicted based on ionic radii, lattice geometry, and charge-balancing considerations alone due to the underlying complexity of the interactions between the many chemical constituents.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We close that gap with gpuFLOPBench, a benchmark that asks models to \"count without running\" by predicting single and double-precision FLOP counts for 577 CUDA kernels drawn from HeCBench, annotated with ground-truth profiles and eight execution attributes that distinguish trivially analyzable code from kernels whose FLOPs depend on hidden compiler or runtime behavior.

This is then used to create a completely constructive multi-qubit coherence enhancement protocol, where only effective-qubit unitaries are used. Unexpectedly, in this protocol, we show that there exists states for which the ratio of the input-output coherence can be amplified unboundedly.

It is based on an extension of Kelly's model, a framework derived from information theory and investment theory, applied here to understand macro-financial and climate dynamics. This approach complements traditional Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) by explicitly linking financial dynamics to cumulative emissions, enabling the assessment of policy alignment (or misalignment) with net-zero pathways. We find that injecting debt into the system increases short-term production gains, but at the expense of higher bankruptcy risk and cumulative emissions. Thus, the model reveals a double constraint: financially, debt requires growth to be repaid; ecologically, growth requires energy, and therefore emissions. When the intrinsic growth rate falls below the interest rate, the probability of solvency drops to zero: the economy enters a zone of structural instability. The model then identifies an optimal leverage frontier: beyond a certain threshold, additional debt no longer fuels real wealth; it only increases the risk of bankruptcy and carbon debt. Our model is calibrated using multi-decade macroeconomic and emissions data from several countries, including the United States, China, France, and Denmark. Our results confirm that the correlation between cumulative debt, cumulative GDP, and cumulative emissions remains strong, regardless of the political structure of credit.

These vehicles have limited processing capability and payload capacity, which makes advanced deep learning methods and heavy sensors impractical. Flying insects, such as bees, achieve remarkable landings with minimal neural and sensory resources, relying heavily on optical flow. By regulating flow divergence, a measure of vertical velocity divided by height, they perform smooth landings in which velocity and height decay exponentially together. However, adapting this bio-inspired strategy for spacecraft landings on sloped terrain presents two key challenges: global flow-divergence estimates obscure terrain inclination, and the nonlinear nature of divergence-based control can lead to instability when using conventional controllers. This paper proposes a nonlinear control strategy that leverages two distinct local flow divergence estimates to regulate both thrust and attitude during vertical landings. The control law is formulated based on Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion to handle the nonlinear flow divergence. The thrust control ensures a smooth vertical descent by keeping a constant average of the local flow divergence estimates, while the attitude control aligns the vehicle with the inclined surface at touchdown by exploiting their difference. The approach is evaluated in numerical simulations using a simplified 2D spacecraft model across varying slopes and divergence setpoints. Results show that regulating the average divergence yields stable landings with exponential decay of velocity and height, and using the divergence difference enables effective alignment with inclined terrain.

Based on these metrics, we formulate two optimization problems: the first maximizes the max-min average SNR across users, while the second maximizes a guaranteed SNR threshold under per-user outage constraints. Although both problems are inherently nonconvex, we exploit their underlying monotonic structures and develop low-complexity, bisection-based algorithms that achieve globally optimal solutions using only simple scalar evaluations. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and demonstrate that pinching-antenna systems significantly outperform conventional fixed-antenna designs even under random LoS and NLoS channels.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This mitigates the performance degradation that arise when a single policy is forced to fuse heterogeneous, potentially mismatched observations from locomotion and manipulation. Our key innovation lies in restoring coordination between these two independent policies through a vision-language foundation model, which encodes global observations and language instructions into a shared latent embedding conditioning both diffusion policies.

Our central finding: when Eve interpolates her classical correlations with quantum data at mixing parameter, all tested detection methods achieve ROC AUC = 0.50, equivalent to random guessing. This means an eavesdropper needs only 5% classical admixture to completely evade detection. Critically, we discover that same distribution calibration a common practice in prior certification studies inflates detection performance by 44 percentage points compared to proper cross distribution evaluation, revealing a systematic flaw that may have led to overestimated security claims.

Applied to the B20-type chiral magnets ${\\rm Mn}_{1-x}{\\rm Fe}_{x}{\\rm Ge}$ and ${\\rm Fe}_{1-y}{\\rm Co}_{y}{\\rm Ge}$, the resulting models nonperturbatively extract the full pairwise exchange tensor (isotropic exchange, anisotropic symmetric exchange, and the Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction) and predict helical spin period via a micromagnetic mapping. The composition trends and the divergence of the period near the chirality sign change are reproduced in line with experiments. Because the SCE framework is systematic, it also enables systematic analysis of interaction order; training on increasingly disordered spin configurations shows that the lowest-order model loses torque accuracy, whereas including higher-order interactions restores predictive power. These advances enable near-DFT-accurate spin models for finite-temperature magnetism and complex textures at modest data cost, while providing a systematic, extensible, and nonperturbative route to quantitative first-principles parameterization and predictive materials design.

This optimization typically assumes prior knowledge of the target direction, which is unavailable before the target is detected. To enhance direction estimation, it is critical to develop array pattern synthesis techniques that yield a wider beam by maximizing the received power over the entire target area. Although this challenge has been addressed with active antennas, RIS systems pose a unique challenge due to their inherent phase constraints, which can be continuous or discrete.\n  This work addresses this challenge through a novel array pattern synthesis method tailored for discrete phase constraints in RIS. We introduce a penalty method that pushes these constraints to the boundary of the convex hull. Then, the Minorization-Maximization (MM) method is utilized to reformulate the problem into a convex one. Our numerical results show that our algorithm can generate a wide beam pattern comparable to that achievable with per-power constraints, with both the amplitudes and phases being adjustable.

Here, we demonstrate that introducing materials with high ionic mobility can significantly expand the accessible oxygen concentration range within the dielectric layer, significantly broadening the memory window. Using SrTiO3-based memristive stacks, we integrated an ion-conducting SrCoO3 interfacial layer to facilitate oxygen transfer, increasing the number of distinguishable resistance states from 8 to 22. This modification also reduced the SET/RESET voltage by 50% and markedly improved device endurance, albeit with a trade-off of reduced state retention. To assess the practical implications of this trade-off, we trained a two-layer fully connected neural network using the experimental SrTiO3/SrCoO3 memristor characteristics on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. Networks with hidden-layer sizes between 64 and 256 memristive elements achieved classification errors below 7%.

We here develop a general theory to control an arbitrary number of bosonic modes governed by the time-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. It takes advantage of the gauge potential in the instantaneous frame rather than the energy spectrum of Hamiltonian. In particular, the dynamics of a general non-Hermitian continuous-variable system is analyzed in the instantaneous frame associated with time-dependent ancillary operators that are superpositions of the laboratory-frame operators and irrelevant to the original Hamiltonian. The gauge potential is determined by the unitary transformation between the time-dependent and stationary ancillary frames. The upper triangularization condition for the Hamiltonian's coefficient matrix in the stationary ancillary frame enables two of the time-dependent ancillary operators to be nonadiabatic Heisenberg passages of the non-Hermitian system. The probability conservation of the system wavefunction can be restored at the end of these passages without artificial normalization. Our theory is exemplified with the perfect and nonreciprocal state transfers in a cavity magnonic system. The former holds for arbitrary initial states and is irrelevant to the parity-time symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the exceptional point of the spectra; and the latter is consistent with the unidirectional perfect absorbtion.

The SDE model provides two particular insights to improve PnP-Flow for image restoration: (1) It enables us to quantify the error for image restoration, informing us to improve step scheduling and regularize the Lipschitz constant of the neural network-parameterized vector field for error reduction. (2) It informs us to accelerate off-the-shelf PnP-Flow models via extrapolation, resulting in a rescaled version of the proposed SDE model. We validate the efficacy of the SDE-informed improved PnP-Flow using several benchmark tasks, including image denoising, deblurring, super-resolution, and inpainting.

In recent derivations of this type of transport equations that are based on the density matrix formalism, there remain, however, certain omissions. These derivations also rely on a particular type of relaxation time approximation and a band-diagonal form of the interaction self-energies. In this work we derive the interband terms of the electronic Boltzmann transport equation starting from the Keldysh formulation of the quantum kinetic equation and considering the band non-diagonality of the electron-impurity and electron-phonon self-energies. We introduce a minimally modified Kadanoff-Baym Ansatz, and find a quantum-corrected, matrix Boltzmann transport equation that is well beyond the current state of the art theory. We show that the occupations and coherences are interdependent, and that the kinetic corrections due to the included interactions cannot, in general, be ignored.

This work's empirical analysis reveals two recurring issues associated with this gap: (1) Most traditional methods lead the edited model to overfit to the new fact, thereby degrading pre-trained capabilities; (2) There is a critical absence of a knowledge consolidation stage, leaving new facts insufficiently integrated into LLMs' inference-time behavior under autoregressive generation, thereby leading to a mismatch between parametric knowledge and actual generation behavior.

While optical single mode fibres (SMFs) are the current standard type of fibre, recent hollow core fibres (HCFs) could become a superior alternative in the future.

This work explores the behaviour of HCF with respect to phase noise for the purpose of TF-QKD-like protocols. To achieve this, two experiments are performed. The first, is a set of concurrent measurements on 2 km of HCF and SMF in a double asymmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometer configuration.

Although many existing gesture sensing solutions perform well in-domain but lack cross-domain capabilities (i.e., recognition performance in untrained environments). To address this, we extract Doppler spectra from the channel state information (CSI) received by all receivers and concatenate each Doppler spectrum along the same time axis to generate fused images with multi-angle information as input features. Furthermore, inspired by the convolutional block attention module (CBAM), we propose a gesture recognition network that integrates a multi-semantic spatial attention mechanism with a self-attention-based channel mechanism. This network constructs attention maps to quantify the spatiotemporal features of gestures in images, enabling the extraction of key domain-independent features. Additionally, ResNet18 is employed as the backbone network to further capture deep-level features.

In order to probe infinite order phase transition, we propose to utilise the ground state energy obtained from VQE. The idea rests on the argument that VQE requires an ansatz circuit; therefore, the accuracy of the VQE will rely on this ansatz circuit. We have designed this circuit such that the estimated ground state energy is sensitive to the phase it is evaluated in. It is achieved by applying the constraint that the net spin remains constant throughout the optimisation process. Consequently, the ansatz works in a certain phase where it gives relatively small random error, as it should, when compared to the error in ground state energy calculations of the other phases, where the ansatz fails. By identifying these changes in the behaviour of the error in ground state energy using VQE, we were able to determine the phase boundaries. Using exact diagonalisation, we also compare the behaviour of the energy gradient and energy gap across both the phase transition boundaries for this model.

The protocol exploits classical shadow tomography for measurement efficiency, and applies unequal error protection by encoding measurement bases with stronger channel codes than measurement outcomes. We provide theoretical guarantees on estimation accuracy as a function of the bit error probability of the classical channel, and validate the approach against several benchmarks via numerical results.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Three planned reference trajectories are compared against a free-driving baseline (NOREF) to assess trade-offs between lap time (LT) and steering effort (SE): NOM, the nominal time-optimal trajectory; TLC, a track-limit-robust trajectory obtained by tightening margins to the track edges; and FLC, a friction-limit-robust trajectory obtained by tightening against axle and tire saturation. All trajectories share the same minimum lap-time objective with a small steering-smoothness regularizer and are evaluated by two professional drivers using a high-performance car on a virtual track. The trajectories derive from a disturbance-aware minimum-lap-time framework recently proposed by the authors, where worst-case disturbance growth is propagated over a finite horizon and used to tighten tire-friction and track-limit constraints, preserving performance while providing probabilistic safety margins. LT and SE are used as performance indicators, while RMS lateral deviation, speed error, and drift angle characterize driving style. Results show a Pareto-like LT-SE trade-off: NOM yields the shortest LT but highest SE; TLC minimizes SE at the cost of longer LT; FLC lies near the efficient frontier, substantially reducing SE relative to NOM with only a small LT increase. Removing trajectory guidance (NOREF) increases both LT and SE, confirming that reference trajectories improve pace and control efficiency.

While efforts have focused on the effect of process parameters such as reaction pressure, input power or carbon source, the intricate role and relationship with plasma characteristics like density and temperature are often overlooked due to the complexity of the environment. This study addresses this gap by establishing a correlation between process parameters, plasma characteristics, and product morphology, essential for controlling the growth of carbon nanostructures. We explored the impact of carbon precursor type (CH4 and C2H2), hydrogen, pressure, and flow rate on nanostructure formation. Using in situ optical emission spectroscopy (OES), we mapped the distribution of both temperature and dicarbon molecule (C2) density within the plasma jet. We demonstrate that the growth of low-density nanostructures, such as carbon nanohorns (CNHs), is favoured at dilute C2 local densities and high temperatures, while denser nanostructures, such as onion-like polyhedral graphitic nanocapsules (GNCs), are favoured at higher C2 densities and lower temperatures. The carbon density can be controlled by the flow rate and the pressure, which in turn significantly influence the nanostructure morphology, evolving from graphene nanoflakes (GNFs) to GNCs as either parameter increases. Increasing the H/C ratio from 1 to 8 resulted in a morphological transition from CNHs to GNFs. During the synthesis, the plasma jet temperature surpassed 3,000 K, with crystalline growth occurring 50 to 100 mm below the nozzle.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Energies beyond the electronic and vibrational (or phononic) main contributions might be relevant when small energy differences are important, such as when predicting stable polymorphs or describing magnetic energy landscape.

Our construction involves applying different permutations between replicas of the ground state wavefunction in neighboring spatial regions, creating \"permutation defects\" at the boundaries between these regions. We provide general arguments for the robustness of these measures and develop a field-theoretical framework to compute them systematically. While the standard topological field theory prescription misses the chiral contribution, our method correctly identifies it as the chiral conformal field theory partition function on high-genus Riemann surfaces.

Existing approaches, whether end-to-end semantic parsing or stepwise agent-based reasoning, often suffer from structural inaccuracies and prohibitive computational costs, particularly when processing intricate queries over large knowledge graphs. To address these limitations, we introduce SEAL, a novel two-stage semantic parsing framework grounded in self-evolving agentic learning. In the first stage, a large language model (LLM) extracts a minimal S-expression core that captures the essential semantics of the input query. This core is then refined by an agentic calibration module, which corrects syntactic inconsistencies and aligns entities and relations precisely with the underlying knowledge graph. The second stage employs template-based completion, guided by question-type prediction and placeholder instantiation, to construct a fully executable S-expression. This decomposition not only simplifies logical form generation but also significantly enhances structural fidelity and linking efficiency. Crucially, SEAL incorporates a self-evolving mechanism that integrates local and global memory with a reflection module, enabling continuous adaptation from dialog history and execution feedback without explicit retraining.

However, due to unnecessary rejections caused by token mismatches in semantically equivalent steps, traditional token-level Speculative Decoding struggles in reasoning tasks. Although recent works have shifted to step-level semantic verification, which improve efficiency by accepting or rejecting entire reasoning steps, existing step-level methods still regenerate many rejected steps with little improvement, wasting valuable target compute. To address this challenge, we propose Arbitrage, a novel step-level speculative generation framework that routes generation dynamically based on the relative advantage between draft and target models.

In recent years, deep learning techniques have attracted significant attention in medical image classification. However, it is usually infeasible to train an entire large deep learning model from scratch. To address this issue, one of the solutions is the transfer learning (TL) technique, where a pre-trained model is reused for a new task. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of TL techniques for medical image classification using deep convolutional neural networks. We evaluate six pre-trained models (AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, and InceptionV3) on a custom chest X-ray dataset for disease detection. The experimental results demonstrate that InceptionV3 consistently outperforms other models across all the standard metrics. The ResNet family shows progressively better performance with increasing depth, whereas VGG16 and AlexNet perform reasonably well but with lower accuracy. In addition, we also conduct uncertainty analysis and runtime comparison to assess the robustness and computational efficiency of these models. Our findings reveal that TL is beneficial in most cases, especially with limited data, but the extent of improvement depends on several factors such as model architecture, dataset size, and domain similarity between source and target tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that with a well-trained feature extractor, only a lightweight feedforward model is enough to provide efficient prediction.

This paper presents an explainable multimodal framework that integrates RGB and Depth (RGB-D) data to recognize Parkinsonian gait patterns under realistic conditions. The proposed system employs dual YOLOv11-based encoders for modality-specific feature extraction, followed by a Multi-Scale Local-Global Extraction (MLGE) module and a Cross-Spatial Neck Fusion mechanism to enhance spatial-temporal representation. This design captures both fine-grained limb motion (e.g., reduced arm swing) and overall gait dynamics (e.g., short stride or turning difficulty), even in challenging scenarios such as low lighting or occlusion caused by clothing. To ensure interpretability, a frozen Large Language Model (LLM) is incorporated to translate fused visual embeddings and structured metadata into clinically meaningful textual explanations. Experimental evaluations on multimodal gait datasets demonstrate that the proposed RGB-D fusion framework achieves higher recognition accuracy, improved robustness to environmental variations, and clear visual-linguistic reasoning compared with single-input baselines. By combining multimodal feature learning with language-based interpretability, this study bridges the gap between visual recognition and clinical understanding, offering a novel vision-language paradigm for reliable and explainable Parkinsons disease gait analysis.

We first discuss two basic control principles -- coherent control which uses manipulation in frequency or time to design these interferences, and adiabatic following where access to the control target is enabled by tracking the time-dependent ground state. For complex control targets and system dynamics that exceed the scope of these basic principles, optimal control theory provides a powerful suite of tools to design the necessary protocols. A key consideration for the successful application of optimal control theory is a proper choice of the optimization functional.

Beyond this paradigm, we propose a new self-paced and self-corrective masked prediction method called SSMP, which achieves state-of-the-art results in automatic trailer generation via bi-directional contextual modeling and progressive self-correction.

The model is trained via masked prediction, reconstructing each trailer shot sequence from its randomly masked counterpart. The mask ratio is self-paced, allowing the task difficulty to adapt to the model and thereby improving model performance. When generating a movie trailer, the model fills the shot positions with high confidence at each step and re-masks the remaining positions for the next prediction, forming a progressive self-correction mechanism that is analogous to how human editors work.

In the absence of expert demonstrations, training LLM agents has relied on policy gradient methods that optimize LLM policies with respect to an (often sparse) reward function. However, in long-horizon tasks with sparse rewards, learning from trajectory-level rewards can be noisy, leading to training that is unstable and has high sample complexity. Furthermore, policy improvement hinges on discovering better actions through exploration, which can be difficult when actions lie in natural language space. In this paper, we propose Natural Language Actor-Critic (NLAC), a novel actor-critic algorithm that trains LLM policies using a generative LLM critic that produces natural language rather than scalar values. This approach leverages the inherent strengths of LLMs to provide a richer and more actionable training signal; particularly, in tasks with large, open-ended action spaces, natural language explanations for why an action is suboptimal can be immensely useful for LLM policies to reason how to improve their actions, without relying on random exploration. Furthermore, our approach can be trained off-policy without policy gradients, offering a more data-efficient and stable alternative to existing on-policy methods.

StreamEQA evaluates existing MLLMs along two orthogonal dimensions: Embodied and Streaming. Along the embodied dimension, we categorize the questions into three levels: perception, interaction, and planning, which progressively assess a model's ability to recognize fine-grained visual details, reason about agent-object interactions, and perform high-level goal-directed reasoning. For the streaming dimension, questions are divided into backward, real-time, and forward reasoning, with each mode relying on a distinct temporal context. Built upon 156 independent long videos, StreamEQA defines 42 tasks and generates approximately 21K question-answer pairs with precise timestamps through a hybrid pipeline combining automated generation and human refinement.

However, they often fail in scenarios requiring a deeper understanding of physical dynamics. This limitation primarily arises from their reliance on appearance-based matching. Incorporating physical motion modeling is crucial for deeper video understanding, but presents three key challenges: (1) motion signals are often entangled with appearance variations, making it difficult to extract clean physical cues; (2) effective motion modeling requires not only continuous-time motion representations but also capturing physical dynamics; and (3) collecting accurate annotations for physical attributes is costly and often impractical. To address these issues, we propose PhyVLLM, a physical-guided video-language framework that explicitly incorporates physical motion into Video LLMs. Specifically, PhyVLLM disentangles visual appearance and object motion through a dual-branch encoder. To model physical dynamics over time, we incorporate a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) module, which generates differentiable physical dynamic representations. The resulting motion-aware representations are projected into the token space of a pretrained LLM, enabling physics reasoning without compromising the model's original multimodal capabilities. To circumvent the need for explicit physical labels, PhyVLLM employs a self-supervised manner to model the continuous evolution of object motion.

Second, to better distill motion dynamics from teacher models, we propose a novel Rewarded Distribution Matching Distillation (Re-DMD). Vanilla distribution matching treats every training sample equally, limiting the model's ability to prioritize dynamic content. Instead, Re-DMD biases the model's output distribution toward high-reward regions by prioritizing samples with greater dynamics rated by a vision-language model. Re-DMD significantly enhances motion quality while preserving data fidelity.

Most existing ASSR approaches rely on implicit neural representation (INR), but its regression-driven feature extraction and aggregation intrinsically limit the ability to synthesize fine details, leading to low realism. Recent diffusion-based realistic image super-resolution (Real-ISR) models leverage powerful pre-trained diffusion priors and show impressive results at the 4x setting. We observe that they can also achieve ASSR because the diffusion prior implicitly adapts to scale by encouraging high-realism generation. However, without explicit scale control, the diffusion process cannot be properly adjusted for different magnification levels, resulting in excessive hallucination or blurry outputs, especially under ultra-high scales. To address these issues, we propose OmniScaleSR, a diffusion-based realistic arbitrary-scale SR framework designed to achieve both high fidelity and high realism.

However, within such a multi-domain scenario, the differences between multiple domains, rather than the subtle real/fake distinctions, dominate the feature space. As a result, despite detectors being able to relatively separate real and fake within each domain (i.e., high AUC), they struggle with single-image real/fake judgments in domain-unspecified conditions (i.e., low ACC).

It is utilized in numerous domains. Nonetheless, object detection continues to encounter the issue of catastrophic forgetting. The model must be retrained whenever new products are introduced, utilizing not only the new products dataset but also the entirety of the previous dataset. The outcome is obvious: increasing model training expenses and significant time consumption. In numerous sectors, particularly retail checkout, the frequent introduction of new products presents a great challenge. This study introduces You Only Train Once (YOTO), a methodology designed to address the issue of catastrophic forgetting by integrating YOLO11n for object localization with DeIT and Proxy Anchor Loss for feature extraction and metric learning. For classification, we utilize cosine similarity between the embedding features of the target product and those in the Qdrant vector database. In a case study conducted in a retail store with 140 products, the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves encouraging accuracy, whether for detecting new or existing products. Furthermore, without retraining, the training duration difference is significant. We achieve almost 3 times the training time efficiency compared to classical object detection approaches. This efficiency escalates as additional new products are added to the product database. The average inference time is 580 ms per image containing multiple products, on an edge device, validating the proposed framework's feasibility for practical use.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Observing these, we propose Semantic-First Diffusion (SFD), a latent diffusion paradigm that explicitly prioritizes semantic formation. SFD first constructs composite latents by combining a compact semantic latent, which is extracted from a pretrained visual encoder via a dedicated Semantic VAE, with the texture latent. The core of SFD is to denoise the semantic and texture latents asynchronously using separate noise schedules: semantics precede textures by a temporal offset, providing clearer high-level guidance for texture refinement and enabling natural coarse-to-fine generation.

A solution to access these texts is virtual unrolling, where the papyrus surface is digitally traced out in a CT scan of the scroll, to create a flattened representation. This tracing is very laborious to do manually in gigavoxel-sized scans, so automated approaches are desirable. We present the first top-down method that automatically fits a surface model to a CT scan of a severely damaged scroll. We take a novel approach that globally fits an explicit parametric model of the deformed scroll to existing neural network predictions of where the rolled papyrus likely passes. Our method guarantees the resulting surface is a single continuous 2D sheet, even passing through regions where the surface is not detectable in the CT scan.

Conventional deep learning approaches require large annotated datasets, which are costly and often imbalanced across disease categories, limiting their reliability in practice. Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses this challenge by enabling models to generalize from only a few labeled samples per class. In this study,we propose a balanced few-shot episodic learning framework tailored to the Retinal Fundus Multi-Disease Image Dataset (RFMiD). Focusing on the ten most represented classes, which still show substantial imbalance between majority diseases (e.g., Diabetic Retinopathy, Macular Hole) and minority ones (e.g., Optic Disc Edema, Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion), our method integrates three key components: (i) balanced episodic sampling, ensuring equal participation of all classes in each 5-way 5-shot episode; (ii) targeted augmentation, including Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and color/geometry transformations, to improve minority-class di- versity; and (iii) a ResNet-50 encoder pretrained on ImageNet, selected for its superior ability to capture fine-grained retinal features. Prototypes are computed in the embedding space and classification is performed with cosine similarity for improved stability. Trained on 100 episodes and evaluated on 1,000 test episodes, our framework achieves substantial accuracy gains and reduces bias toward majority classes, with notable improvements for underrepresented diseases.

To address these limitations, we propose 4DLangVGGT, the first Transformer-based feed-forward unified framework for 4D language grounding, that jointly integrates geometric perception and language alignment within a single architecture. 4DLangVGGT has two key components: the 4D Visual Geometry Transformer, StreamVGGT, which captures spatio-temporal geometric representations of dynamic scenes; and the Semantic Bridging Decoder (SBD), which projects geometry-aware features into a language-aligned semantic space, thereby enhancing semantic interpretability while preserving structural fidelity. Unlike prior methods that depend on costly per-scene optimization, 4DLangVGGT can be jointly trained across multiple dynamic scenes and directly applied during inference, achieving both deployment efficiency and strong generalization. This design significantly improves the practicality of large-scale deployment and establishes a new paradigm for open-vocabulary 4D scene understanding. Experiments on HyperNeRF and Neu3D datasets demonstrate that our approach not only generalizes effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving up to 2% gains under per-scene training and 1% improvements under multi-scene training.

Instead of focusing on modeling motion, our goal is to create a frozen scene while strategically preserving subtle dynamics to enable user-controlled instant selection. To achieve this, we introduce a novel application of dynamic Gaussian splatting: the scene is modeled dynamically, which retains nearby temporal variation, and a static scene is rendered by fixing the model's time parameter. However, under this usage, monocular capture with sparse temporal supervision introduces artifacts like ghosting and blur for Gaussians that become unobserved or occluded at weakly supervised timestamps. We propose Splannequin, an architecture-agnostic regularization that detects two states of Gaussian primitives, hidden and defective, and applies temporal anchoring. Under predominantly forward camera motion, hidden states are anchored to their recent well-observed past states, while defective states are anchored to future states with stronger supervision. Our method integrates into existing dynamic Gaussian pipelines via simple loss terms, requires no architectural changes, and adds zero inference overhead.

We provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that demonstrates that neural networks systematically converge to shared spectral subspaces regardless of initialization, task, or domain. Through mode-wise spectral analysis of over 1100 models - including 500 Mistral-7B LoRAs, 500 Vision Transformers, and 50 LLaMA-8B models - we identify universal subspaces capturing majority variance in just a few principal directions. By applying spectral decomposition techniques to the weight matrices of various architectures trained on a wide range of tasks and datasets, we identify sparse, joint subspaces that are consistently exploited, within shared architectures across diverse tasks and datasets. Our findings offer new insights into the intrinsic organization of information within deep networks and raise important questions about the possibility of discovering these universal subspaces without the need for extensive data and computational resources. Furthermore, this inherent structure has significant implications for model reusability, multi-task learning, model merging, and the development of training and inference-efficient algorithms, potentially reducing the carbon footprint of large-scale neural models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
