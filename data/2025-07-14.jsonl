However, current methods often suffer from\na geometric inconsistency problem by focusing exclusively on matching\nuser-defined points, neglecting the broader geometry and leading to artifacts\nor unstable edits. We propose FlowDrag, which leverages geometric information\nfor more accurate and coherent transformations. Our approach constructs a 3D\nmesh from the image, using an energy function to guide mesh deformation based\non user-defined drag points. The resulting mesh displacements are projected\ninto 2D and incorporated into a UNet denoising process, enabling precise\nhandle-to-target point alignment while preserving structural integrity.\nAdditionally, existing drag-editing benchmarks provide no ground truth, making\nit difficult to assess how accurately the edits match the intended\ntransformations. To address this, we present VFD (VidFrameDrag) benchmark\ndataset, which provides ground-truth frames using consecutive shots in a video\ndataset. FlowDrag outperforms existing drag-based editing methods on both VFD\nBench and DragBench."}

We prove that, if H is hereditary, CMSO-definable,\nand decidable in polynomial time, then H-Planarity is solvable in polynomial\ntime. Further, we introduce two parametric extensions of H-Planarity by\ndefining the notions of H-planar treedepth and H-planar treewidth, which\ngeneralize the concepts of elimination distance and tree decompositions to the\nclass H.

The perception is carried out by a\nspectrum sensing module providing the true relevant spectral parameters of the\nsources in the environment. The action stage employs a tailored signal design\nprocess, synthesizing a radar waveform with bespoke spectral notches, enabling\nISAR imaging over a wide spectral bandwidth without interfering with the other\nradio frequency (RF) sources.

Despite recent research efforts, existing\nQFL frameworks predominantly focus on unimodal systems, limiting their\napplicability to real-world tasks that often naturally involve multiple\nmodalities. To fill this significant gap, we present for the first time a novel\nmultimodal approach specifically tailored for the QFL setting with the\nintermediate fusion using quantum entanglement. Furthermore, to address a major\nbottleneck in multimodal QFL, where the absence of certain modalities during\ntraining can degrade model performance, we introduce a Missing Modality\nAgnostic (MMA) mechanism that isolates untrained quantum circuits, ensuring\nstable training without corrupted states. Simulation results demonstrate that\nthe proposed multimodal QFL method with MMA yields an improvement in accuracy\nof 6.84% in independent and identically distributed (IID) and 7.25% in non-IID\ndata distributions compared to the state-of-the-art methods."}

Inspired by the success of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), researchers have developed Large Multimodal\nModels (LMMs) with ICL capabilities. However, explorations of demonstration\nconfiguration for multimodal ICL remain preliminary. Additionally, the\ncontrollability of In-Context Examples (ICEs) provides an efficient and\ncost-effective means to observe and analyze the inference characteristics of\nLMMs under varying inputs. This paper conducts a comprehensive external and\ninternal investigation of multimodal in-context learning on the image\ncaptioning task. Externally, we explore demonstration configuration strategies\nthrough three dimensions: shot number, image retrieval, and caption assignment.\nWe employ multiple metrics to systematically and thoroughly evaluate and\nsummarize key findings. Internally, we analyze typical LMM attention\ncharacteristics and develop attention-based metrics to quantify model\nbehaviors. We also conduct auxiliary experiments to explore the feasibility of\nattention-driven model acceleration and compression. We further compare\nperformance variations between LMMs with identical model design and pretraining\nstrategies and explain the differences from the angles of pre-training data\nfeatures. Our study reveals both how ICEs configuration strategies impact model\nperformance through external experiments and characteristic typical patterns\nthrough internal inspection, providing dual perspectives for understanding\nmultimodal ICL in LMMs. Our method of combining external and internal analysis\nto investigate large models, along with our newly proposed metrics, can be\napplied to broader research areas."}

To reduce bBobsleigh training costs, leveraging the\ncenterline of the bobsleigh track to construct a virtual environment that\nclosely replicates real competitive settings presents a promising solution.\nHowever, publicly available centerline data are typically limited and it is\nimprecise to construct a training system solely based on 2-dimensional (2D)\ncenterline. To address this practical issue, this paper proposes a method for\ngenerating a 3-dimensional (3D) track centerline based on 2D centerline data.\nIncorporating international track design regulations, the method formulates an\noptimization problem that considers total track length, height difference,\nslope constraints, and geometric continuity. A Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)\nalgorithm is used to solve the optimization problem. The generated 3D\ncenterlines are compared with real track data, and the results show that the\nmethod can reproduce realistic centerline trends from original or scaled 2D\ndata. For the selected track segment, the relative errors in total length,\nheight difference, and average slope are within 1.7%, 3.2% and 4.1%,\nrespectively, for real 2D data and within 1.1%, 3.5% and 4.3% respectively for\nscaled data.

Moreover, by\nadjusting the segmentation or modifying the weight of height difference in the\ncost function, various centerline styles applicable to different competitions\ncan be generated. Under different segmentation and weight factors, the maximum\nerrors reach up to 4.4%, 4.8%, and 9.8%, and 4.4%, 4.8%, and 10.0%,\nrespectively.

Here we detail a simple reference model of transient\ndiffusion creep, based on finite element calculations with simple grain shapes:\na regular hexagon in 2D and a tetrakaidecadedron in 3D. The linear viscoelastic\nbehaviour of the finite element models can be well described by a parameterised\nextended Burgers model, which behaves as a Maxwell model at low frequencies and\nas an Andrade model at high frequencies.

Herein, we focus on three judgment\ntasks relevant to elderly driver assessments: evaluating traffic density,\nassessing intersection visibility, and recognizing stop signs recognition.\nThese tasks require contextual reasoning rather than simple object detection.\nUsing zero-shot, few-shot, and multi-shot prompting strategies, we evaluated\nthe performance of the model with human annotations serving as the reference\nstandard. Evaluation metrics included precision, recall, and F1-score. Results\nindicate that prompt design considerably affects performance, with recall for\nintersection visibility increasing from 21.7% (zero-shot) to 57.0%\n(multi-shot). For traffic density, agreement increased from 53.5% to 67.6%. In\nstop-sign detection, the model demonstrated high precision (up to 86.3%) but a\nlower recall (approximately 76.7%), indicating a conservative response\ntendency.

For\nmodels with sufficiently high connectivity, TaT dynamics exhibits two key\nfeatures: 1) it features both scalable squeezing at short times, as well as\nquantum Fisher information with Heisenberg scaling at later times; and 2)\nscalable multipartite entanglement (up to Heisenberg scaling) is reached in a\ntime growing only logarithmically with system size, associated with an\nexponential buildup of quantum correlations. These results can be shown exactly\nin the XY model with a Rabi field and infinite range interactions, and\nnumerically in the case of spatially decaying XY interactions, such as dipolar\ninteractions in two dimensions, provided that unstable spin-wave modes do not\ndevelop for large system sizes and/or strong fields.

In a clinical scenario, the scarcity of\nannotated medical images makes it challenging to select optimal in-context\npairs, and fine-tuning foundation ICL models on contextual data is infeasible\ndue to computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address\nthis challenge, we propose Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a novel framework\nthat enhances ICL-based medical image segmentation by enabling\nself-verification of predictions and accordingly enhancing contextual\nalignment. Specifically, CCV employs a cyclic pipeline in which the model\ninitially generates a segmentation mask for the query image. Subsequently, the\nroles of the query and an in-context pair are swapped, allowing the model to\nvalidate its prediction by predicting the mask of the original in-context\nimage. The accuracy of this secondary prediction serves as an implicit measure\nof the initial query segmentation. A query-specific prompt is introduced to\nalter the query image and updated to improve the measure, thereby enhancing the\nalignment between the query and in-context pairs. We evaluated CCV on seven\nmedical image segmentation datasets using two ICL foundation models,\ndemonstrating its superiority over existing methods.

Recent\nresearch also suggests a significant connection between the Wehrl entropy and\nmany-body quantum entanglement in spin systems. We investigate the statistical\ninterpretation of the Husimi function and the Wehrl entropy, taking the system\nof $N$ spin-1/2 particles as an example. Due to the completeness of coherent\nstates, the Husimi function and Wehrl entropy can be explained via the positive\noperator-valued measurement (POVM) theory, although the coherent states are not\na set of orthonormal basis. Here, with the help of the Bayes' theorem, we\nprovide an alternative probabilistic interpretation for the Husimi function and\nthe Wehrl entropy. This interpretation is based on direct measurements of the\nsystem, and thus does not require the introduction of an ancillary system as in\nPOVM theory. Moreover, under this interpretation the classical correspondences\nof the Husimi function and Wehrl entropy are just phase-space probability\ndistribution function of $N$ classical tops, and its associated entropy,\nrespectively. Therefore, this explanation contributes to a better understanding\nof the relationship between the Husimi function, Wehrl entropy, and\nclassical-quantum correspondence. The generalization of this statistical\ninterpretation to continuous-variable systems is also discussed."}

Our\nresults show that knowledge distillation generally yields better in-domain and\nout-of-domain ranking performance than contrastive learning when distilling\nfrom a larger teacher model.

To this end, we introduce MuGCP (Multi-modal Mutual-Guidance\nConditional Prompt Learning), a novel paradigm designed for conditional prompt\ngeneration. MuGCP leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as\nconditional prompt learners to adaptively generate Semantic Conditional Prompts\n(SCP) that incorporate rich, fine-grained high-level semantic knowledge for\nimage instances. To ensure effective alignment and interaction across the\nmulti-modal space of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we introduce the Attention\nMutual-Guidance (AMG) module, which facilitates interactions between visual and\nsemantic information. Through mutual guidance, the AMG module generates Visual\nConditional Prompts (VCP), enhancing the model's performance in multi-modal\ntasks. Additionally, we present a Multi-Prompt Fusion (MPF) mechanism that\nintegrates SCP and VCP with contextual prompts, ensuring seamless coordination\namong the different prompts and enhancing the modeling of class embeddings and\ninstance-specific knowledge.

This decomposition, formalised using\na so-called routed graph, represents the information flow within the respective\nprocess.

In this work, we establish a\ncomprehensive Misattribution Framework with 6 primary and 15 secondary\ncategories to facilitate in-depth analysis. Based on this framework, we present\nAttriData, a dataset specifically designed for error attribution, encompassing\nmisattribution, along with the corresponding scores and feedback. We also\npropose MisAttributionLLM, a fine-tuned model on AttriData, which is the first\ngeneral-purpose judge model capable of simultaneously generating score,\nmisattribution, and feedback. Extensive experiments and analyses are conducted\nto confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method."}

While\ntraditional pipelines like Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo\n(MVS) achieve high precision through iterative optimization, they are limited\nby complex workflows, high computational cost, and poor robustness in\nchallenging scenarios like texture-less regions. Recently, deep learning has\ncatalyzed a paradigm shift in 3D reconstruction. A new family of models,\nexemplified by DUSt3R, has pioneered a feed-forward approach. These models\nemploy a unified deep network to jointly infer camera poses and dense geometry\ndirectly from an Unconstrained set of images in a single forward pass. This\nsurvey provides a systematic review of this emerging domain. We begin by\ndissecting the technical framework of these feed-forward models, including\ntheir Transformer-based correspondence modeling, joint pose and geometry\nregression mechanisms, and strategies for scaling from two-view to multi-view\nscenarios.

To some extent, the structure resembles that of a\nfield-effect transistor with multiple controlling electrodes (gates).\nScalability is audible and it opens up a possibility of large-scale quantum\ncomputer fabricated by advanced silicon technology. Moreover, the structure\ncould be developed into an ensemble quantum register where instead of single\nnanowire an array of them with common controlling electrodes and contacts is\nfabricated. This ensemble register is much more resistant against environment\nnoise caused by phonons and stray charges due to averaging and compensation. It\nis crucial that an individual qubit consists of two DQDs. The basic states of\nthat qubit correspond to symmetric state of one DQD and antisymmetric state of\nanother, and vice versa.

We\nsuggest a novel perspective that frames document recognition as a transcription\ntask from a document to a record. This implies a natural grouping of documents\nbased on the intrinsic structure inherent in their transcription, where related\ndocument types can be treated (and learned) similarly.

This task is especially useful when the audio is unavailable (e.g.\ndeleted) or unreliable (e.g. anonymized speech). Prior work in this area has\nprimarily focused on the feasibility of attributing speakers using transcripts\nproduced by human annotators. However, in real-world settings, one often only\nhas more errorful transcripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR)\nsystems. In this paper, we conduct what is, to our knowledge, the first\ncomprehensive study of the impact of automatic transcription on speaker\nattribution performance. In particular, we study the extent to which speaker\nattribution performance degrades in the face of transcription errors, as well\nas how properties of the ASR system impact attribution. We find that\nattribution is surprisingly resilient to word-level transcription errors and\nthat the objective of recovering the true transcript is minimally correlated\nwith attribution performance.

We hypothesize that hash centers of\nsemantically related classes should have closer Hamming distances, while those\nof unrelated classes should be more distant. To this end, we propose a\nthree-stage framework, SHC, to generate hash codes that preserve semantic\nstructure.\n  First, we develop a classification network to identify semantic similarities\nbetween classes using a data-dependent similarity calculation that adapts to\nvarying data distributions. Second, we introduce an optimization algorithm to\ngenerate semantic hash centers, preserving semantic relatedness while enforcing\na minimum distance between centers to avoid excessively similar hash codes.\nFinally, a deep hashing network is trained using these semantic centers to\nconvert images into binary hash codes.\n  Experimental results on large-scale retrieval tasks across several public\ndatasets show that SHC significantly improves retrieval performance.\nSpecifically, SHC achieves average improvements of +7.26%, +7.62%, and +11.71%\nin MAP@100, MAP@1000, and MAP@ALL metrics, respectively, over state-of-the-art\nmethods."}

However, state-of-the-art approaches treat document\nrecognition as a mere computer vision problem, neglecting these underlying\ndocument-type-specific structural properties, making them dependent on\nsub-optimal heuristic post-processing and rendering many less frequent or more\ncomplicated document types inaccessible to modern document recognition. We\nsuggest a novel perspective that frames document recognition as a transcription\ntask from a document to a record. This implies a natural grouping of documents\nbased on the intrinsic structure inherent in their transcription, where related\ndocument types can be treated (and learned) similarly. We propose a method to\ndesign structure-specific inductive biases for the underlying machine-learned\nend-to-end document recognition systems, and a respective base transformer\narchitecture that we successfully adapt to different structures. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the so-found inductive biases in extensive experiments\nwith progressively complex record structures from monophonic sheet music, shape\ndrawings, and simplified engineering drawings. By integrating an inductive bias\nfor unrestricted graph structures, we train the first-ever successful\nend-to-end model to transcribe engineering drawings to their inherently\ninterlinked information. Our approach is relevant to inform the design of\ndocument recognition systems for document types that are less well understood\nthan standard OCR, OMR, etc., and serves as a guide to unify the design of\nfuture document foundation models."}

To mitigate this we propose the\nuse of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV)\nfeatures (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of\nthe total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various\nscales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case,\northogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are\nempirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of\nlowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using\nlearners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we\nexamine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of\ncomputed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography\n(PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases. The database consists of\n457 scans with 1524 unique pairs of registered CT and PET slices.

In this\npaper, we propose the first method for learning supervised-based robot\nhandovers solely from RGB images without the need of real-robot training or\nreal-robot data collection. The proposed policy learner, Human-to-Robot\nHandover using Sparse-View Gaussian Splatting (H2RH-SGS), leverages sparse-view\nGaussian Splatting reconstruction of human-to-robot handover scenes to generate\nrobot demonstrations containing image-action pairs captured with a camera\nmounted on the robot gripper. As a result, the simulated camera pose changes in\nthe reconstructed scene can be directly translated into gripper pose changes.\nWe train a robot policy on demonstrations collected with 16 household objects\nand {\\em directly} deploy this policy in the real environment.
