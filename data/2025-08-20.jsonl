We initiate the study of the sparsification of random CSPs. In\nparticular, we consider two natural random models: the $r$-partite model and\nthe uniform model. In the $r$-partite model, CSPs are formed by partitioning\nthe variables into $r$ parts, with constraints selected by randomly picking one\nvertex out of each part. In the uniform model, $r$ distinct vertices are chosen\nat random from the pool of variables to form each constraint.\n  In the $r$-partite model, we exhibit a sharp threshold phenomenon. For every\npredicate $P$, there is an integer $k$ such that a random instance on $n$\nvertices and $m$ edges cannot (essentially) be sparsified if $m \\le n^k$ and\ncan be sparsified to size $\\approx n^k$ if $m \\ge n^k$. Here, $k$ corresponds\nto the largest copy of the AND which can be found within $P$. Furthermore,\nthese sparsifiers are simple, as they can be constructed by i.i.d. sampling of\nthe edges.\n  In the uniform model, the situation is a bit more complex. For every\npredicate $P$, there is an integer $k$ such that a random instance on $n$\nvertices and $m$ edges cannot (essentially) be sparsified if $m \\le n^k$ and\ncan sparsified to size $\\approx n^k$ if $m \\ge n^{k+1}$. However, for some\npredicates $P$, if $m \\in [n^k, n^{k+1}]$, there may or may not be a nontrivial\nsparsifier. In fact, we show that there are predicates where the\nsparsifiability of random instances is non-monotone, i.e., as we add more\nrandom constraints, the instances become more sparsifiable. We give a precise\n(efficiently computable) procedure for determining which situation a specific\npredicate $P$ falls into."}

In this paper, we\nfocus on Airy beams, which may exhibit several highly desirable properties in\nthe near-field region. Ideally, these beams follow self-accelerating (curved)\ntrajectories, demonstrate resilience to perturbations through self-healing, and\nmaintain a consistent intensity profile across all planes perpendicular to the\npropagation direction, making them effectively diffraction-free. Specifically,\nwe first present the underlying principles of self-accelerating beams radiated\nby continuous aperture field distributions. We then address several challenges\nregarding the generation of Airy beams, including their exponential decay due\nto finite energy constraints and spatial truncation of the aperture. Moreover,\nwe examine their free-space propagation characteristics. The second part of the\npaper focuses on the propagation behavior of Airy beams in non-line-of-sight\n(NLoS) scenarios. A comparison is also presented between Airy beams and\nGaussian beams. Our theoretical and numerical results show that Airy beams may\noffer a performance advantage over Gaussian beams in certain NLoS channels,\nprovided that their key properties are largely preserved, specifically,\nself-acceleration along a parabolic trajectory and diffraction-free\npropagation.

Due to the limitations of current\nsynchronization technologies, TS errors have become a significant challenge in\nthe development of the CF-ISAC system. In this paper, we propose a novel\nCF-ISAC architecture based on movable antennas (MAs), which exploits spatial\ndiversity to enhance communication rates, maintain sensing accuracy, and reduce\nthe impact of TS errors. We formulate a worst-case sensing accuracy\noptimization problem for TS errors to address this challenge, deriving the\nworst-case Cram\\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB).

Semiconductor materials exhibiting high\nTCR are promising candidates for applications in high-resolution thermal\nimaging for autonomous systems, high-precision temperature sensing, and\nneuromorphic computing. However, the TCR magnitude is typically below 5%/K near\n300 K for thermal imaging materials, such as vanadium oxide and amorphous\nsilicon. Inspired by the distinctive characteristic of feedback in electronic\ncircuits, we demonstrate a voltage-tunable TCR of up to 150%/K near 300 K in a\ntwo-terminal InGaAs/InP n-p-n transistor, enabled by an internal coherent\ncarrier feedback mechanism. In this device, current amplification arises from a\nsynergistic interplay between temperature-dependent transistor gain and\navalanche multiplication. Carriers amplified at the emitter-base junction via\nthe transistor effect are injected into the collector-base junction, where\navalanche multiplication generates additional carriers. These excess carriers\nare then fed back to the emitter-base junction, triggering further transistor\namplification. This regenerative positive feedback loop results in a high and\nbias-tunable temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR).

To address this, we propose a movable antenna\n(MA)-aided CF-ISAC system that mitigates distortion and enhances robustness.\nThe PAs nonlinearities are modeled by a third-order memoryless polynomial,\nwhere the third-order distortion coefficients (3RDCs) vary across access points\n(APs) due to hardware differences, aging, and environmental conditions.

To address these challenges, we propose GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based\nframework for synthesizing realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain.\nUnlike prior works that rely on simulated environments or alternative\ngenerative models, GaitCrafter trains a video diffusion model from scratch,\nexclusively on gait silhouette data. Our approach enables the generation of\ntemporally consistent and identity-preserving gait sequences. Moreover, the\ngeneration process is controllable-allowing conditioning on various covariates\nsuch as clothing, carried objects, and view angle. We show that incorporating\nsynthetic samples generated by GaitCrafter into the gait recognition pipeline\nleads to improved performance, especially under challenging conditions.\nAdditionally, we introduce a mechanism to generate novel identities-synthetic\nindividuals not present in the original dataset-by interpolating identity\nembeddings. These novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns and\nare useful for training models while maintaining privacy of real subjects.\nOverall, our work takes an important step toward leveraging diffusion models\nfor high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation."}

We refer to these environments as ``Social Mini-Games'' (SMGs). SMGs\nare tightly coupled, high-agency interactions that arise within general\nmulti-robot navigation (MRN) scenarios. They are identified through certain\ndistinct characteristics and require specialized metrics to evaluate them.\nTraditional navigation approaches designed for MRN do not perform well in SMGs,\nwhich has led to focused research on dedicated SMG solvers (navigation methods\nspecialized to navigate in SMGs), which has flourished in recent years.\nHowever, publications on SMG navigation research make different assumptions (on\ncentralized versus decentralized, observability, communication, cooperation,\netc.), and have different objective functions (safety versus liveness).

We formulate HCC as a constrained optimization problem whose\nsolutions yield prediction sets composed of nodes at different levels of the\nhierarchy, while maintaining coverage guarantees. To address the combinatorial\nnature of the problem, we formally show that a much smaller, well-structured\nsubset of candidate solutions suffices to ensure coverage while upholding\noptimality. An empirical evaluation on three new benchmarks consisting of\naudio, image, and text data highlights the advantages of our approach, and a\nuser study shows that annotators significantly prefer hierarchical over flat\nprediction sets."}

The BS can also wake up specific IoTDs if extra information about an event\nis needed upon initial detection. We propose a K-nearest neighbors (KNN)-based\nduty cycling management to optimize energy efficiency and detection accuracy by\nconsidering spatial correlations among IoTDs' activity and their EH process. We\nevaluate machine learning approaches, including reinforcement learning (RL) and\ndecision transformers (DT), to maximize information captured from events while\nmanaging energy consumption. Significant improvements over the state-ofthe-art\napproaches are obtained in terms of energy saving by all three proposals, KNN,\nRL, and DT. Moreover, the RL-based solution approaches the performance of a\ngenie-aided benchmark as the number of IoTDs increases."}

To\naddress this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework\nthat treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic\ncomponents rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated\nneural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships,\nmulti-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical\ndecomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from\nboth successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL\nspecifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds\na causal knowledge base from execution traces.

Here, we elucidate the atomistic mechanisms underlying the\nphase transitions through first-principles calculations and machine-learning\npotential accelerated molecular dynamics simulations. We identify four distinct\nphases: the room-temperature cubic (C) plastic crystal characterized by strong\nfluorine orientational disorder (FOD) and anharmonicity, the\nintermediate-temperature monoclinic (M-II) phase with decreasing FOD, the\nlow-temperature monoclinic (M-I) phase with suppressed FOD, and the fully\nordered rhombohedral (R) phase under pressure. Phonon calculations confirm the\ndynamic stability of the M-II, M-I, and R phases at 0 K, whereas the C phase\nrequires thermal fluctuations for stabilization. Under pressure, all the C,\nM-II, and M-I phases transform to the R phase, which are driven by cooperative\nPF$_6$ octahedral rotations coupled with lattice modulations. These\npressure-induced phase transitions result in persistent isothermal entropy\nchanges across a wide temperature range, thereby explaining the experimentally\nobserved all-temperature BCE in this material. Hybrid functional calculations\nreveal wide-bandgap insulating behavior across all phases. This work deciphers\nthe interplay between FOD, anharmonicity, and phase transitions in KPF$_6$,\nproviding important insights for the design of BCE materials with broad\noperational temperature spans."}

The proposed pipeline employs a two-step methodology: (1)\nUnsupervised Outlier Detection, where Local Outlier Factor (LOF) analysis with\nadaptive neighborhood selection identifies anomalous channels based on\nspectro-temporal features of chirp (Onset frequency, offset frequency, and\ntemporal duration); and (2) Spatial Correlation Analysis, which computes both\nexact co-occurrence metrics and weighted index similarity, incorporating\nhemispheric congruence and electrode proximity. Key findings demonstrate that\nthe LOF-based approach (N neighbors=20, contamination=0.2) effectively detects\noutliers, with index matching (weighted by channel proximity) outperforming\nexact matching in SOZ localization. Performance metrics (precision, recall, F1)\nwere highest for seizure-free patients (Index Precision mean: 0.903) and those\nwith successful surgical outcomes (Index Precision mean: 0.865), whereas\nfailure cases exhibited lower concordance (Index Precision mean: 0.460).

Experimental results on five benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA\nmethods. Our code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/BDCL."}

Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression,\nneglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies.\nRecent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues:\n(1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the\ndesired area, and (2) uniform labeling fails to distinguish between center and\nedges of the target UI element, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how\nhumans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the\nValley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background\ndistractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes\nthe model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For\nthe issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired\napproach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight\ngradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution\nfollows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size.\nConsequently, V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to\nconcentrate on the most essential point of the UI element. The model trained by\nV2P achieves the performance with 92.3% and 50.5% on two benchmarks\nScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro. Ablations further confirm each component's\ncontribution, highlighting V2P's generalizability for precise GUI grounding\ntasks."}

Highly\ncomplex algorithms such as artificial neural networks process enormous volumes\nof data in parallel along multiple hidden layers of interconnected nodes,\nrendering their inner workings epistemically inaccessible to any human being,\nincluding their designers and developers; they are \"black boxes\" for all their\nstakeholders. But opaqueness is not always the inevitable result of technical\ncomplexity. Sometimes, the way an algorithm works is intentionally hidden from\nview for proprietary reasons, especially in commercial automated decision\nsystems, creating an entirely different type of opaqueness.

In this work, we\nintroduce Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel paradigm of LLM reasoning that enables\nnative end-to-end complex problem-solving in the same way as a multi-agent\nsystem (i.e., multi-turn problem solving with multiple tools and multiple\nagents) within one model. In chain-of-agents problem-solving, the model\ndynamically activates different tool agents and role-playing agents to simulate\nmulti-agent collaboration in an end-to-end fashion. To elicit end-to-end\nchain-of-agents problem-solving abilities in LLMs, we introduce a multi-agent\ndistillation framework to distill state-of-the-art multi-agent systems into\nchain-of-agents trajectories for agentic supervised fine-tuning. We then use\nagentic reinforcement learning on verifiable agentic tasks to further improve\nthe models' capabilities on chain-of-agents problem solving.

The insight behind\nDictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for\nunseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the\nnormal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically,\nDictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** -\nto simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from\nnormal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region\nfeatures from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature\ncannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly.

In particular, we propose an extension of a\nrecently introduced entropy-bounded method, making it applicable to\ncounterfactual queries such as the Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency\n(PNS). Our empirical study spans thousands of randomized simulations involving\nboth discrete and continuous data-generating processes. We assess each method\nin terms of bound tightness, computational efficiency, and robustness to\nassumption violations. To support practitioners, we distill our findings into a\npractical decision tree for algorithm selection and train a machine learning\nmodel to predict the best-performing method based on observable data\ncharacteristics.\n  All implementations are released as part of an open-source Python package,\nCausalBoundingEngine, which enables users to apply and compare bounding methods\nthrough a unified interface."}

To\naddress this issue, we propose a novel generative attention-based model to\nlearn the relation of feature semantics. Specifically, by leveraging the\ndifferences of actions' foreground and background, our model simultaneously\nlearns the frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature\nsemantics, which takes advantage of feature semantics in the feature extraction\neffectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive\nexperiments on two benchmark video task, action recognition and action\ndetection.

While mobile network servers have ample\ncomputational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy\nconstraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data. Federated\nLearning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared\nmodel by exchanging model parameters instead of transmitting raw data. Yet, it\nrequires a uniform model architecture and multiple communication rounds, which\nneglect resource heterogeneity, impose heavy computational demands on clients,\nand increase communication overhead. To address these challenges, we propose\nFedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot\nsettings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter\nsharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange\nmodel prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces\ncommunication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full\nmodel weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model\narchitectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may\nbe biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth\nlabels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate\nthese issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that\niteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning\nreliability. To complement this, FedOL incorporates a tailored pseudo-label\ngeneration and knowledge distillation strategy that effectively integrates\ndiverse knowledge.

To overcome the challenge, we propose FedSheafHN, a novel framework\nbuilt on a sheaf collaboration mechanism to unify enhanced client descriptors\nwith efficient personalized model generation. Specifically, FedSheafHN embeds\neach client's local subgraph into a server-constructed collaboration graph by\nleveraging graph-level embeddings and employing sheaf diffusion within the\ncollaboration graph to enrich client representations. Subsequently, FedSheafHN\ngenerates customized client models via a server-optimized hypernetwork.\nEmpirical evaluations demonstrate that FedSheafHN outperforms existing\npersonalized subgraph FL methods on various graph datasets. Additionally, it\nexhibits fast model convergence and effectively generalizes to new clients."}

Building on this benchmark, we propose Mirage-R1, a\nvision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, a reflective\nreasoning mechanism for AIGI detection. Mirage-R1 is trained in two stages: a\nsupervised-fine-tuning cold start, followed by a reinforcement learning stage.\nBy further adopting an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy, Mirage-R1 is\nable to provide either a quick judgment or a more robust and accurate\nconclusion, effectively balancing inference speed and performance. Extensive\nexperiments show that our model leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% and 10%\non Mirage and the public benchmark, respectively. The benchmark and code will\nbe made publicly available."}

This\nwork presents FedUP, a lightweight FU algorithm designed to efficiently\nmitigate malicious clients' influence by pruning specific connections within\nthe attacked model. Our approach achieves efficiency by relying only on\nclients' weights from the last training round before unlearning to identify\nwhich connections to inhibit. Isolating malicious influence is non-trivial due\nto overlapping updates from benign and malicious clients. FedUP addresses this\nby carefully selecting and zeroing the highest magnitude weights that diverge\nthe most between the latest updates from benign and malicious clients while\npreserving benign information.

Functional MRI (fMRI) offers a\nnon-invasive window into large-scale neural dynamics by measuring\nblood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across the brain. These signals can\nbe modeled as interactions among Regions of Interest (ROIs), which are grouped\ninto functional communities based on their underlying roles in brain function.\nEmerging evidence suggests that connectivity patterns within and between these\ncommunities are particularly sensitive to ASD-related alterations. Effectively\ncapturing these patterns and identifying interactions that deviate from typical\ndevelopment is essential for improving ASD diagnosis and enabling biomarker\ndiscovery. In this work, we introduce ASDFormer, a Transformer-based\narchitecture that incorporates a Mixture of Pooling-Classifier Experts (MoE) to\ncapture neural signatures associated with ASD. By integrating multiple\nspecialized expert branches with attention mechanisms, ASDFormer adaptively\nemphasizes different brain regions and connectivity patterns relevant to\nautism.

Then, our Recommender Agent\nreviews the outputs, recommends schema revisions, and decides on the final\nrecommendations, enabling TASER to outperform existing table detection models\nsuch as Table Transformer by 10.1%. Within this continuous learning process, we\nhighlight that larger batch sizes result in a 104.3% increase in schema\nrecommendations that are actionable and utilized, resulting in a 9.8% increase\nin extracted holdings - highlighting the importance of a continuous learning\nprocess. To train TASER, we have manually labeled 22,584 pages (28,150,449\ntokens), 3,213 tables for $731,685,511,687 of holdings culminating in one of\nthe first real financial table datasets. We release our dataset TASERTab to\nenable the research community to access real-world financial tables and\noutputs. Our results highlight the promise of agentic, schema-guided extraction\nsystems for robust understanding of real-world financial tables."}

While mobile network servers have ample\ncomputational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy\nconstraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data. Federated\nLearning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared\nmodel by exchanging model parameters instead of transmitting raw data.

To address these challenges, we propose\nFedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot\nsettings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter\nsharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange\nmodel prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces\ncommunication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full\nmodel weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model\narchitectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may\nbe biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth\nlabels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate\nthese issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that\niteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning\nreliability.

We use a wide range of embodied and\ngeneral visual reasoning datasets as sources to construct a large-scale\ndataset, Embodied-Points-200K, which supports key embodied pointing\ncapabilities. We then train Embodied-R1 using a two-stage Reinforced\nFine-tuning (RFT) curriculum with a specialized multi-task reward design.\nEmbodied-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 embodied spatial and\npointing benchmarks. Critically, it demonstrates robust zero-shot\ngeneralization by achieving a 56.2% success rate in the SIMPLEREnv and 87.5%\nacross 8 real-world XArm tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning,\nrepresenting a 62% improvement over strong baselines. Furthermore, the model\nexhibits high robustness against diverse visual disturbances. Our work shows\nthat a pointing-centric representation, combined with an RFT training paradigm,\noffers an effective and generalizable pathway to closing the perception-action\ngap in robotics."}

However, editing the structural content of 3D scenes\nin videos remains challenging, particularly when dealing with significant\nviewpoint changes, such as large camera rotations or zooms.

To address these issues, we propose Sketch3DVE, a\nsketch-based 3D-aware video editing method to enable detailed local\nmanipulation of videos with significant viewpoint changes. To solve the\nchallenge posed by sparse inputs, we employ image editing methods to generate\nedited results for the first frame, which are then propagated to the remaining\nframes of the video. We utilize sketching as an interaction tool for precise\ngeometry control, while other mask-based image editing methods are also\nsupported. To handle viewpoint changes, we perform a detailed analysis and\nmanipulation of the 3D information in the video. Specifically, we utilize a\ndense stereo method to estimate a point cloud and the camera parameters of the\ninput video. We then propose a point cloud editing approach that uses depth\nmaps to represent the 3D geometry of newly edited components, aligning them\neffectively with the original 3D scene. To seamlessly merge the newly edited\ncontent with the original video while preserving the features of unedited\nregions, we introduce a 3D-aware mask propagation strategy and employ a video\ndiffusion model to produce realistic edited videos.

In this paper,\nwe introduce Fisher-Orthogonal Projection (FOP), a novel technique that\nrestores the effectiveness of the second-order method at very large batch\nsizes, enabling scalable training with improved generalization and faster\nconvergence. FOP constructs a variance-aware update direction by leveraging\ngradients from two sub-batches, enhancing the average gradient with a component\nof the gradient difference that is orthogonal to the average under the\nFisher-metric."}

However, the nature of many\npractical decision-making problems favors a multimodal policy that facilitates\nrobust exploration of the environment and thus to address learning challenges\narising from sparse rewards, complex dynamics, or the need for strategic\nadaptation to varying contexts. This issue is exacerbated in continuous control\ndomains where exploration usually takes place in the vicinity of the predicted\noptimal action, either through an additive Gaussian noise or the sampling\nprocess of a stochastic policy. In this paper, we introduce Categorical\nPolicies to model multimodal behavior modes with an intermediate categorical\ndistribution, and then generate output action that is conditioned on the\nsampled mode. We explore two sampling schemes that ensure differentiable\ndiscrete latent structure while maintaining efficient gradient-based\noptimization. By utilizing a latent categorical distribution to select the\nbehavior mode, our approach naturally expresses multimodality while remaining\nfully differentiable via the sampling tricks. We evaluate our multimodal policy\non a set of DeepMind Control Suite environments, demonstrating that through\nbetter exploration, our learned policies converge faster and outperform\nstandard Gaussian policies. Our results indicate that the Categorical\ndistribution serves as a powerful tool for structured exploration and\nmultimodal behavior representation in continuous control."}

An example is collaborative\nlearning, which aims to train a global model based on data from individual\nagents. A major challenge in designing such systems is to guarantee safety and\nalignment with human values, particularly a fair distribution of rewards upon\nachieving the global goal. Cooperative game theory offers useful abstractions\nof cooperating agents via value functions, which assign value to each\ncoalition, and via reward functions. With these, the idea of fair allocation\ncan be formalized by specifying fairness axioms and designing concrete\nmechanisms. Classical cooperative game theory, exemplified by the Shapley\nvalue, does not fully capture scenarios like collaborative learning, as it\nassumes nonreplicable resources, whereas data and models can be replicated.\nInfinite replicability requires a generalized notion of fairness, formalized\nthrough new axioms and mechanisms. These must address imbalances in reciprocal\nbenefits among participants, which can lead to strategic exploitation and\nunfair allocations. The main contribution of this paper is a mechanism and a\nproof that it fulfills the property of mutual fairness, formalized by the\nBalanced Reciprocity Axiom. It ensures that, for every pair of players, each\nbenefits equally from the participation of the other."}

To evaluate MLLMs on these\nabilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark\ncomprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively\nsimple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and\nproprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably\nidentify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information\n-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought\nprompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate\nthat most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\\deg}) images,\nwhile certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\\deg}) images. None\ncan reliably distinguish between 90{\\deg} and 270{\\deg}. Simultaneously showing\nthe image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains\nfor reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the\nperformance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve\nmodels' ability to distinguish 90{\\deg} and 270{\\deg} rotations, despite\nsubstantially improving the identification of 180{\\deg} images.
