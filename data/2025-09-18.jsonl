Standard Monte Carlo is often the de facto approach for studying\nthe failure rates of quantum circuits. However, in the study of fault-tolerant\nerror-correcting circuits, the ability to extend this approach to low physical\nfailure rates is limited. In particular, the use of Monte Carlo to access\ncircuits that are relatively large or have high correcting power becomes more\ndifficult as we lower the input failure rates of the individual components\n(gates) in the circuit. For these reasons, many simulations studying the\ncircuit model go no lower than end-to-end logical failure rates in the 10^{-6}\nregime. In this report, we outline an approach that borrows from earlier work\nby Bravyi and Vargo to the more complex circuit noise model. Earlier works\nstudied both the capacity and phenomenological noise models, but the work is\ninsufficient for generating similar simulations in the circuit-noise model. To\nthe best of our knowledge, our team is the first to develop a full prescription\nof the rare event simulation by splitting technique for the circuit-based noise\nmodel.

However, computing the\naverage strategy requires significant computational resources or introduces\nadditional errors, limiting its practical applicability. The Reward\nTransformation (RT) framework was introduced to regret minimization to achieve\nlast-iterate convergence through reward function regularization.

In Pt/h-LuFeO3\nbilayers, h-LuFeO3 hosts a topological spin structure robust against high\nmagnetic fields, arising from a 120{\\deg} triangular spin lattice with small\nspin canting that yields nontrivial topology but minimal magnetization. This\ngenerates a giant Hall response in Pt up to 0.5% of the longitudinal\nresistivity and a Hall-conductivity/magnetization ratio above 2 V^{-1}, clearly\ndistinguishable from the spin Hall Hanle effect background. Field- and\ntemperature-dependent analysis further reveals that Pt nanoclusters inherit\ntopological textures from h-LuFeO3 via MPE.

In this work, we further study the complexity\nof solving two-player games on graphs with generalised reachability objectives.\nOur results are twofold: first, we provide an improved complexity picture for\ngeneralised reachability games, expanding the known tractable class from games\nin which all target sets are singleton to additionally allowing a logarithmic\nnumber of target sets of arbitrary size. Second, we study optimisation variants\nof generalised reachability with a focus on the size of the target sets.

Unlike sulfide or\nhalide conductors, oxide conductors generally better resist degradation when in\ncontact with water, but can still undergo topotactic ion exchange between Li\nions within the structure and protons in the environment. In this work, we\ncombine density functional theory (DFT) calculations with a machine-learning\ninteratomic potential model to investigate the thermodynamic driving force of\nthe Li+/H+ exchange reaction for two representative oxide Li-ion conductor\nfamilies: garnets and NASICONs. Our results indicate that the high Li chemical\npotential in Li-stuffed garnets is responsible for the stronger driving force\nfor exchanging Li with protons as compared to the Li-unstuffed structures. In\ncontrast, NASICONs demonstrate a higher resistance against proton exchange,\nwhich is attributed to the lower Li chemical potential and the lower O-H bond\ncovalency for polyanion-bonded oxygens. Our findings highlight the trade-off\nwhen using Li stuffing as a mechanism to enhance Li-ion conductivity, as it\nalso promotes degradation by moisture.

This physical interpretation is particularly useful in light of\nrecent progress in experimentally measuring higher-point OTOCs. We identify\nuniversal behaviours of the FMI and higher-point OTOCs across a variety of\nchaotic systems, including random unitary circuits and chaotic spin chains,\nwhich indicate that spreading in the doubly exponential operator space is a\ngeneric feature of quantum many-body chaos.

We present ROS2, an RDMA-first object storage system\ndesign that offloads the DAOS client to an NVIDIA BlueField-3 SmartNIC while\nleaving the DAOS I/O engine unchanged on the storage server. ROS2 separates a\nlightweight control plane (gRPC for namespace and capability exchange) from a\nhigh-throughput data plane (UCX/libfabric over RDMA or TCP) and removes host\nmediation from the data path.\n  Using FIO/DFS across local and remote configurations, we find that on\nserver-grade CPUs RDMA consistently outperforms TCP for both large sequential\nand small random I/O. When the RDMA-driven DAOS client is offloaded to\nBlueField-3, end-to-end performance is comparable to the host, demonstrating\nthat SmartNIC offload preserves RDMA efficiency while enabling DPU-resident\nfeatures such as multi-tenant isolation and inline services (e.g.,\nencryption/decryption) close to the NIC. In contrast, TCP on the SmartNIC lags\nhost performance, underscoring the importance of RDMA for offloaded\ndeployments.\n  Overall, our results indicate that an RDMA-first, SmartNIC-offloaded\nobject-storage stack is a practical foundation for scaling data delivery in\nmodern LLM training environments; integrating optional GPU-direct placement for\nLLM tasks is left for future work."}

The simulation\nresults for both polite and aggressive human response case studies of the\novertaken vehicle demonstrate that the proposed GT-PRO can achieve for this\nrange of human driver responsiveness, safer, more efficient, and more\ncomfortable autonomous overtaking, as compared to existing autonomous\novertaking approaches in the literature. Furthermore, the results suggest that\nthe GT-PRO method is capable of real-time implementation."}

This suggests a\npotentially highly efficient and scalable non-variational learning method for\nQAOA angle finding.

While the Cr d orbitals contribute similarly to the SOC-MAE in\nboth compounds, the key difference stems from the halogen p orbitals. In CrCl3,\nthe localized Cl 3p orbitals favor spin-flip SOC interactions, particularly\nbetween the (px, py) and (py, pz) channels. These channels contribute with\nopposite signs-negative and positive, respectively-leading to partial\ncancellation and a small net SOC-MAE. As a result, the shape-MAE exceeds the\nSOC-MAE in magnitude, favoring an in-plane EMA. In contrast, CrBr3 features\nmore delocalized Br 4p orbitals, enhanced p-d hybridization, and stronger SOC.\nThis leads to stronger spin-conserving SOC interactions, with dominant\ncontributions from both the (px, py) and (py, pz) channels. In this case, the\npositive contribution from the (px, py) channel outweighs the smaller negative\ncontribution from the (py, pz) channel, resulting in a sizable net SOC-MAE.

Yet, their reported\nlattice thermal conductivities ($\\kappa$) remain highly inconsistent, with\nexperimental values and theoretical predictions differing by more than an order\nof magnitude. These discrepancies stem from uncertainties in measurement\ntechniques, variations in computational protocols, and ambiguities in the\ntreatment of higher-order anharmonic processes. In this study, we critically\nreview these inconsistencies, first by mapping the spread of experimental and\nmodeling results, and then by identifying the methodological origins of\ndivergence. To this end, we bridge first-principles calculations, molecular\ndynamics simulations, and state-of-the-art machine learning force fields\n(MLFFs) including recently developed foundation models. %MACE-OMAT-0, UMA, and\nNEP89. We train and benchmark GAP, MACE, NEP, and \\textsc{HIPHIVE} against\ndensity functional theory (DFT) and rigorously evaluate the impact of third-\nand fourth-order phonon scattering processes on $\\kappa$. The computational\nefficiency of MLFFs enables us to extend convergence tests beyond conventional\nlimits and to validate predictions through homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular\ndynamics as well. Our analysis demonstrates that, contrary to some recent\nclaims, fully converged four-phonon processes contribute negligibly to the\nintrinsic thermal conductivity of both MoS$_2$ and MoSe$_2$. These findings not\nonly refine the intrinsic transport limits of 2D TMDs but also establish\nMLFF-based approaches as a robust and scalable framework for predictive\nmodeling of phonon-mediated thermal transport in low-dimensional materials."}

To solve this obstacle, we apply\nDoob's h-transform efficient fine-tuning (DEFT) for adapting large pre-trained\nunconditional models for downstream image-conditioned VTO abilities. DEFT\nfreezes the pre-trained model's parameters and trains a small h-transform\nnetwork to learn a conditional h-transform.

Specifically, they generally treat all\ncontent uniformly, instead of emphasizing the hateful components. Additionally,\nexisting multimodal methods cannot systematically capture structured\ninformation in videos, limiting the effectiveness of multimodal fusion. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal dual-stream graph\nneural network model. It constructs an instance graph by separating the given\nvideo into several instances to extract instance-level features. Then, a\ncomplementary weight graph assigns importance weights to these features,\nhighlighting hateful instances. Importance weights and instance features are\ncombined to generate video labels. Our model employs a graph-based framework to\nsystematically model structured relationships within and across modalities.\nExtensive experiments on public datasets show that our model is\nstate-of-the-art in hateful video classification and has strong explainability.\nCode is available:\nhttps://github.com/Multimodal-Intelligence-Lab-MIL/MultiHateGNN."}

Judging and Explaining Social Biases with LLMs", "comment": "38 pages, 31 figures", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) can lead to undesired consequences when\nmisaligned with human values, especially in scenarios involving complex and\nsensitive social biases. Previous studies have revealed the misalignment of\nLLMs with human values using expert-designed or agent-based emulated bias\nscenarios. However, it remains unclear whether the alignment of LLMs with human\nvalues differs across different types of scenarios (e.g., scenarios containing\nnegative vs. non-negative questions). In this study, we investigate the\nalignment of LLMs with human values regarding social biases (HVSB) in different\ntypes of bias scenarios. Through extensive analysis of 12 LLMs from four model\nfamilies and four datasets, we demonstrate that LLMs with large model parameter\nscales do not necessarily have lower misalignment rate and attack success rate.\nMoreover, LLMs show a certain degree of alignment preference for specific types\nof scenarios and the LLMs from the same model family tend to have higher\njudgment consistency. In addition, we study the understanding capacity of LLMs\nwith their explanations of HVSB. We find no significant differences in the\nunderstanding of HVSB across LLMs. We also find LLMs prefer their own generated\nexplanations. Additionally, we endow smaller language models (LMs) with the\nability to explain HVSB.

Quantum nonlocality is\nquantified via the sensitivity of the Bohmian velocity of one particle to the\nposition of the other. Our results show that in both distinct (local) and\ncommon bath scenarios, nonlocal correlations initially grow from zero, reach a\npeak, and then decay. In the case of local baths, the decay is smooth and\nmonotonic; although the peak value increases with temperature, its temporal\nwidth (measured via the full width at half maximum) decreases, indicating a\nshorter duration of nonlocal correlations. For a common bath, the initial\ngrowth and decay are followed by revivals and oscillations, whose amplitude and\ntiming vary with temperature. These non-monotonic behaviors arise despite the\nMarkovian nature of the underlying dynamics and reflect the nontrivial role of\nsystem-bath correlations. We also analyze how both temperature and the\nsqueezing decay parameter affect the structure of Bohmian trajectories and the\nevolution of nonlocal correlations. This trajectory-based, velocity-sensitivity\nmeasure offers an intuitive and quantitative understanding of entanglement\ndegradation, decoherence, and their characteristic time scales.

We propose CDFlow, a novel framework that addresses\nthese limitations by learning a continuous flow in configuration space via\nNeural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs).

We propose TFMAdapter, a\nlightweight, instance-level adapter that augments TSFMs with covariate\ninformation without fine-tuning. Instead of retraining, TFMAdapter operates on\nthe limited history provided during a single model call, learning a\nnon-parametric cascade that combines covariates with univariate TSFM forecasts.\nHowever, such learning would require univariate forecasts at all steps in the\nhistory, requiring too many calls to the TSFM.

We attribute\nthis to (i) additional, uniformly spaced integration steps oversample the\nlate-time region, thereby constraining actions towards the training\ntrajectories and reducing generalisation; and (ii) the learned velocity field\nbecoming non-Lipschitz as integration time approaches 1, causing instability.\nTo address these issues, we propose a novel policy that utilises non-uniform\ntime scheduling (e.g., U-shaped) during training, which emphasises both early\nand late temporal stages to regularise policy training, and a dense-jump\nintegration schedule at inference, which uses a single-step integration to\nreplace the multi-step integration beyond a jump point, to avoid unstable areas\naround 1. Essentially, our policy is an efficient one-step learner that still\npushes forward performance through multi-step integration, yielding up to 23.7%\nperformance gains over state-of-the-art baselines across diverse robotic tasks."}

In this paper, we present a\nnovel instruction tuning framework, PDDL-Instruct, designed to enhance LLMs'\nsymbolic planning capabilities through logical chain-of-thought reasoning. Our\napproach focuses on teaching models to rigorously reason about action\napplicability, state transitions, and plan validity using explicit logical\ninference steps. By developing instruction prompts that guide models through\nthe precise logical reasoning required to determine when actions can be applied\nin a given state, we enable LLMs to self-correct their planning processes\nthrough structured reflection. The framework systematically builds verification\nskills by decomposing the planning process into explicit reasoning chains about\nprecondition satisfaction, effect application, and invariant preservation.\nExperimental results on multiple planning domains show that our\nchain-of-thought reasoning based instruction-tuned models are significantly\nbetter at planning, achieving planning accuracy of up to 94% on standard\nbenchmarks, representing a 66% absolute improvement over baseline models.

A multi-camera bundle adjustment (MCBA) jointly refines\nposes and depths via dense photometric and geometric residuals, while a scale\nconsistency module enforces metric alignment across views using low-rank\npriors. The system supports RGB input and maintains real-time performance at\nlarge scale. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that\nMCGS-SLAM consistently yields accurate trajectories and photorealistic\nreconstructions, usually outperforming monocular baselines. Notably, the wide\nfield of view from multi-camera input enables reconstruction of side-view\nregions that monocular setups miss, critical for safe autonomous operation.\nThese results highlight the promise of multi-camera Gaussian Splatting SLAM for\nhigh-fidelity mapping in robotics and autonomous driving."}

Beyond this\nbaseline alignment, we further design an Anomaly-Aware Calibration Module\n(AACM), which explicitly guides the CLS token to attend to anomalous regions\nrather than generic foreground semantics, thereby enhancing discriminability.\nExtensive experiments on eight industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate\nthat AD-DINOv3 consistently matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods,\nverifying its superiority as a general zero-shot anomaly detection framework."}

We present a distributed mobile sensing framework for source\nlocalization in which each robot carries a machine-learned, finite element\nmodel of its environment to guide information-based sampling. The models are\nused to evaluate an approximate mutual information criterion to drive an\ninfotaxis control strategy, which selects sensing regions that are expected to\nmaximize informativeness for the source localization objective. Our approach\nachieves faster error reduction compared to baseline sensing strategies and\nresults in more accurate source localization compared to baseline machine\nlearning approaches."}

Unlike many prior models that\nrelease weights without reproducible data pipelines or regard for content-owner\nrights, Apertus models are pretrained exclusively on openly available data,\nretroactively respecting robots.txt exclusions and filtering for\nnon-permissive, toxic, and personally identifiable content. To mitigate risks\nof memorization, we adopt the Goldfish objective during pretraining, strongly\nsuppressing verbatim recall of data while retaining downstream task\nperformance. The Apertus models also expand multilingual coverage, training on\n15T tokens from over 1800 languages, with ~40% of pretraining data allocated to\nnon-English content. Released at 8B and 70B scales, Apertus approaches\nstate-of-the-art results among fully open models on multilingual benchmarks,\nrivalling or surpassing open-weight counterparts. Beyond model weights, we\nrelease all scientific artifacts from our development cycle with a permissive\nlicense, including data preparation scripts, checkpoints, evaluation suites,\nand training code, enabling transparent audit and extension."}
