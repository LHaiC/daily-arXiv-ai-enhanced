To address this issue, two decidable\nsubclasses, Realisable with Synchronous Communication (RSC) and k-Multiparty\nCompatibility} (k-MC), were proposed in the literature, with corresponding\nverification tools developed and applied in practice. Unfortunately, both RSC\nand k-MC are not resilient under failures: (1) their decidability relies on the\nassumption of perfect channels and (2) most standard protocols do not satisfy\nRSC or k-MC under failures. To address these limitations, this paper studies\nthe resilience of RSC and k-MC under two distinct failure models: interference\nand crash-stop failures. For interference, we relax the conditions of RSC and\nk-MC and prove that the inclusions of these relaxed properties remain decidable\nunder interference, preserving their known complexity bounds.

Temporal logics like HyperLTL capture these\nproperties by explicitly quantifying over executions of a system.

However, such scaling incurs considerable\ntraining overhead, posing challenges for researchers with limited computational\nresources and hindering the sustained development of SNNs. Data pruning is a\npromising strategy for accelerating training by retaining the most informative\nexamples and discarding redundant ones, but it remains largely unexplored in\nSNNs. Directly applying ANN-based data pruning methods to SNNs fails to capture\nthe intrinsic importance of examples and suffers from high gradient variance.\nTo address these challenges, we propose a novel spike-aware data pruning (SADP)\nmethod. SADP reduces gradient variance by determining each example's selection\nprobability to be proportional to its gradient norm, while avoiding the high\ncost of direct gradient computation through an efficient upper bound, termed\nspike-aware importance score. This score accounts for the influence of\nall-or-nothing spikes on the gradient norm and can be computed with negligible\noverhead. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and architectures\ndemonstrate that SADP consistently outperforms data pruning baselines and\nachieves training speedups close to the theoretical maxima at different pruning\nratios. Notably, SADP reduces training time by 35% on ImageNet while\nmaintaining accuracy comparable to that of full-data training. This work,\ntherefore, establishes a data-centric paradigm for efficient SNN training and\npaves the way for scaling SNNs to larger models and datasets.

We formalize these\nideas by proving that a real-space adiabatic quantum algorithm (RsAA) achieves\nprovably polynomial-time optimization for broad families of nonconvex\nfunctions.

We present a randomized algorithm for linear programs with two-sided\nconstraints that requires $\\tilde{O}(n^{1.5}k)$ bits of communication when each\nconstraint has at most $k$ non-zeros. This result improves upon the prior work\nby [Ghadiri, Lee, Padmanabhan, Swartworth, Woodruff, Ye, STOC'24], which\nachieves a complexity of $\\tilde{O}(n^2)$ bits for LPs with one-sided\nconstraints.

Motivated by the interplay between flat-band physics and interband\ncoupling in generating irregular BOs, here we investigate these oscillations in\nLieb and Kagome lattices using two complementary approaches: coherent transport\nsimulations and scattering matrix analysis. In the presence of unavoidable band\ntouchings, half-fundamental and fundamental BO frequencies are observed in Lieb\nand Kagome lattices, respectively -- a behavior directly linked to their\ndistinct band structures. When avoided band touchings are introduced, distinct\nBO frequency responses to coupling parameters in each lattice are observed.\nScattering matrix analysis reveals strong coupling and potential LZTs between\ndispersive bands and the flat band in Kagome lattices, with the quadratic band\ntouching enhancing interband interactions and resulting in BO dynamics that is\ndistinct from systems with linear crossings.

This paper presents a hybrid\nframework that combines a distributed multi-GPU inference system with an\ninteractive visualization platform for analyzing celebrity dynamics in video\nepisodes. The inference framework efficiently processes large volumes of video\ndata by leveraging optimized ONNX models, heterogeneous batch inference, and\nhigh-throughput parallelism, ensuring scalable generation of timestamped\nappearance records. These records are then transformed into a comprehensive\nsuite of visualizations, including appearance frequency charts, duration\nanalyses, pie charts, co-appearance matrices, network graphs, stacked area\ncharts, seasonal comparisons, and heatmaps. Together, these visualizations\nprovide multi-dimensional insights into video content, revealing patterns in\ncelebrity prominence, screen-time distribution, temporal dynamics,\nco-appearance relationships, and intensity across episodes and seasons. The\ninteractive nature of the system allows users to dynamically explore data,\nidentify key moments, and uncover evolving relationships between individuals.\nBy bridging distributed recognition with structured, visually-driven analytics,\nthis work enables new possibilities for entertainment analytics, content\ncreation strategies, and audience engagement studies."}

State-of-the-art game-theoretic models, such as the Escape\nInterdiction Game (EIG), provide comprehensive frameworks but assume a highly\ndynamic interaction and entail significant computational complexity, which can\nbe prohibitive for real-time applications.

We propose the Dynamic Programming for\nEvader Route Optimization (DPERO) algorithm, which models the environment as a\ngraph with probabilistic risks at various nodes. By transforming the\nmultiplicative survival objective into an additive cost function using\nlogarithms, we frame the task as a shortest path problem solvable with value\niteration.

Given a base model,\nNeon first fine-tunes it on its own self-synthesized data but then,\ncounterintuitively, reverses its gradient updates to extrapolate away from the\ndegraded weights.

As our main building-block, we\ndemonstrate a rigorous correspondence between the spectral properties of\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger operators and the mixing times of classical Langevin diffusion.\nThis correspondence motivates a mechanism for separation on functions with\nunique global minimum: while quantum algorithms operate on the original\npotential, classical diffusions correspond to a Schr\\\"{o}dinger operators with\na WKB potential having nearly degenerate global minima. We formalize these\nideas by proving that a real-space adiabatic quantum algorithm (RsAA) achieves\nprovably polynomial-time optimization for broad families of nonconvex\nfunctions. First, for block-separable functions, we show that RsAA maintains\npolynomial runtime while known off-the-shelf algorithms require exponential\ntime and structure-aware algorithms exhibit arbitrarily large polynomial\nruntimes. These results leverage novel non-asymptotic results in semiclassical\nanalysis. Second, we use recent advances in the theory of intrinsic\nhypercontractivity to demonstrate polynomial runtimes for RsAA on appropriately\nperturbed strongly convex functions that lack global structure, while\noff-the-shelf algorithms remain exponentially bottlenecked. In contrast to\nprior works based on quantum tunneling, these separations do not depend on the\ngeometry of barriers between local minima. Our theoretical claims about\nclassical algorithm runtimes are supported by rigorous analysis and\ncomprehensive numerical benchmarking. These findings establish a rigorous\ntheoretical foundation for quantum advantage in continuous optimization and\nopen new research directions connecting quantum algorithms, stochastic\nprocesses, and semiclassical analysis."}

We report here\nour experimental study of the evolution of the correlated states of an\nultrahigh-quality 2DES confined to a 72.5-nm-wide GaAs quantum well. At the\nlowest densities, the 2DES displays only odd-denominator FQHSs, and the ground\nstate at $\\nu = 1/2$ is a composite fermion Fermi sea.

Leveraging this connection, we show that the proposed DC program has\na nonpositive optimal objective value if and only if a well-defined continuous\nvector map admits a fixed point. Crucially, we prove that the reformulated\nfixed point problem satisfies all the conditions of Brouwer's fixed point\ntheorem, except that self-containedness is violated by an arbitrarily small\npositive constant.

As foveation\nlevels increase, the rendering quality is reduced, and traditional foveated\nrendering systems tend not to preserve samples that were previously rendered at\nhigh spatial resolution in previous frames. Additionally, prior research has\nshown that saccade landing positions are distributed around a target location\nrather than landing at a single point, and that even during fixations, eyes\nperform small microsaccades around a fixation point.

Using a simple water-droplet lift-off method, we obtained\nsubmillimeter- to millimeter-sized membranes that retained crystallinity, as\nconfirmed by high-resolution X-ray diffraction, and exhibited robust tetragonal\nsymmetry by Raman spectroscopy. Impedance spectroscopy confirmed a high\ndielectric constant of 1340, reflecting the robust dielectric response of the\nmembranes. Ferroelectric functionality was revealed by piezoresponse force\nmicroscopy (PFM) and further verified by polarization-electric field (P-E) loop\nmeasurements with Positive-Up-Negative-Down (PUND).

Using a biomechanical model inspired by morphoelasticity\nand active filament theory, we precompute a shape library and construct a\n$k$-nearest neighbor graph in \\emph{shape space}, ensuring that each node\ncorresponds to a mechanically accurate and physically valid robot shape. For\nthe graph, we use signed distance functions to prune nodes and edges colliding\nwith obstacles, and define multi-objective edge costs based on geometric\ndistance and actuation effort, enabling energy-efficient planning with\ncollision avoidance. We demonstrate that our algorithm reliably avoids\nobstacles and generates feasible paths within milliseconds from precomputed\ngraphs using Dijkstra's algorithm.

This paper introduces the Reactive Transformer (RxT), a novel\narchitecture designed to overcome these limitations by shifting from a\ndata-driven to an event-driven paradigm. RxT processes each conversational turn\nas a discrete event in real-time, maintaining context in an integrated,\nfixed-size Short-Term Memory (STM) system. The architecture features a distinct\noperational cycle where a generator-decoder produces a response based on the\ncurrent query and the previous memory state, after which a memory-encoder and a\ndedicated Memory Attention network asynchronously update the STM with a\nrepresentation of the complete interaction. This design fundamentally alters\nthe scaling dynamics, reducing the total user-facing cost of a conversation\nfrom quadratic ($O(N^2 \\cdot T)$) to linear ($O(N \\cdot T)$) with respect to\nthe number of interactions $N$.

Traditional\nrobust and data-driven optimization methods often fail to leverage the features\nof the prediction model (also known as contextual or covariate information)\nwhen constructing the uncertainty set, leading to overly conservative\noperational decisions.

Thus, there is a need for learning frameworks that can achieve\nrobust generalization under scarce multi-modal data in wireless networks. In\nthis paper, a novel and data-efficient two-phase learning framework is proposed\nto improve generalization performance in unseen and unfamiliar wireless\nenvironments with minimal amount of multi-modal data. In the first stage, a\nphysics-based loss function is employed to enable each BS to learn the physics\nunderlying its wireless environment captured by multi-modal data. The\ndata-efficiency of the physics-based loss function is analytically\ninvestigated. In the second stage, collaborative domain adaptation is proposed\nto leverage the wireless environment knowledge of multiple BSs to guide\nunder-performing BSs under domain shift. Specifically, domain-similarity-aware\nmodel aggregation is proposed to utilize the knowledge of BSs that experienced\nsimilar domains. To validate the proposed framework, a new dataset generation\nframework is developed by integrating CARLA and MATLAB-based mmWave channel\nmodeling to predict mmWave RSS. Simulation results show that the proposed\nphysics-based training requires only 13% of data samples to achieve the same\nperformance as a state-of-the-art baseline that does not use physics-based\ntraining. Moreover, the proposed collaborative domain adaptation needs only 25%\nof data samples and 20% of FLOPs to achieve the convergence compared to\nbaselines."}

Motivated by the interplay between flat-band physics and interband\ncoupling in generating irregular BOs, here we investigate these oscillations in\nLieb and Kagome lattices using two complementary approaches: coherent transport\nsimulations and scattering matrix analysis. In the presence of unavoidable band\ntouchings, half-fundamental and fundamental BO frequencies are observed in Lieb\nand Kagome lattices, respectively -- a behavior directly linked to their\ndistinct band structures. When avoided band touchings are introduced, distinct\nBO frequency responses to coupling parameters in each lattice are observed.\nScattering matrix analysis reveals strong coupling and potential LZTs between\ndispersive bands and the flat band in Kagome lattices, with the quadratic band\ntouching enhancing interband interactions and resulting in BO dynamics that is\ndistinct from systems with linear crossings. In contrast, the Lieb lattice -- a\nthree level system -- shows independent coupling between the flat band and two\ndispersive bands, without direct LZTs occurring between the two dispersive\nbands themselves. Finally, to obtain a unifying perspective on these results,\nwe examine BOs during a strain-induced transition from Kagome to Lieb lattices,\nand link the evolution of irregular BO frequencies to changes in band\nconnectivity and interband coupling."}

The interaction with the environment\nleads to energy losses in the resonators, and the finite size of the\nenvironment leads to a non-Markovian dynamics of the relaxation process. We\ndemonstrate that non-Markovian processes in the quasi-PT-symmetric system can\nmake the states of the system infinitely living, loss-protected states, even in\nthe absence of gain. There is a critical value of the interaction between the\nresonator and the environment below which any state of the system is\nloss-protected. When the interaction magnitude is greater than the critical\nvalue, depending on the coupling strength between the resonators, either one or\nboth states are unprotected. We show that the boundaries of regions with\ndifferent numbers of protected states are determined by the relaxation rates in\nthe quasi-PT-symmetric system, calculated in the Markovian approximation. By\nchanging the coupling strength between the resonators and the interaction\nmagnitude between the resonator and the environment, the system switches\nbetween modes with two, one, or no loss-protected states. This makes it\npossible to realize stable PT-symmetric devices based on purely dissipative\nsystems. The obtained results are applicable to quantum systems with single\nexcitations, allowing the concept of PT symmetry to be extended to such\nsystems."}

Inspired by speculative execution in microprocessors and\nspeculative decoding in LLM inference, we propose speculative actions, a\nlossless framework for general agentic systems that predicts likely actions\nusing faster models, enabling multiple steps to be executed in parallel. We\nevaluate this framework across three agentic environments: gaming, e-commerce,\nweb search, and a \"lossy\" extension for an operating systems environment. In\nall cases, speculative actions achieve substantial accuracy in next-action\nprediction (up to 55%), translating into significant reductions in end-to-end\nlatency.

To\naddress these questions, this paper introduces the first theoretical framework\nfor analyzing the convergent optimal representations of MCL and the modality\nalignment when training is optimized. Specifically, we prove that without any\nconstraint or under the cone constraint, the modality gap converges to zero.\nUnder the subspace constraint (i.e., representations of two modalities fall\ninto two distinct hyperplanes due to dimension collapse), the modality gap\nconverges to the smallest angle between the two hyperplanes. This result\nidentifies \\emph{dimension collapse} as the fundamental origin of the modality\ngap. Furthermore, our theorems demonstrate that paired samples cannot be\nperfectly aligned under the subspace constraint.

Examining stationary\npoints and their dynamical stability, we identify a phase diagram for $n\\geq 3$\nwith three distinctive features: a $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ ($\\mathbb{Z}_{2n}$)\nsymmetry-breaking superradiant phase for even (odd) $n$, a normal\nunbroken-symmetry phase that is dynamically unstable due to non-reciprocal\nforces between emitters, and a first-order phase transition separating these\nphases. This $n$-phase Dicke model may be equivalently realized in a variety of\noptomechanical or opto-magnonic settings, where it can serve as a testbed for\nstudying high-order symmetry breaking and non-reciprocal interactions in open\nsystems."}

In this work, we introduce SDQ-LLM: Sigma-Delta Quantization for\n1-bit LLMs of any size, a novel framework that enables extremely low-bit\nquantization of LLMs while preserving their linguistic reasoning capabilities.\nA distinctive feature of SDQ-LLM is the continuous adjustability of the\nOver-Sampling Ratio (OSR), enabling dynamic adaptation to memory or VRAM\nconstraints by selecting fractional OSR (e.g. 2.5 times) for an optimal\ntrade-off between model size and accuracy. SDQ-LLM uses upsampling combined\nwith Sigma-Delta Quantizer to binarize or ternarize LLMs weights, encoding\nhigh-precision parameters into 1-bit or 1.58-bit representations, replacing the\nmultiplication operations within linear layers with addition. This approach\nsignificantly enhances inference efficiency under extremely low-bit\nquantization. To further reduce the loss of quantization precision, we\nincorporate Hadamard-based weight smoothing prior to quantization, improving\nthe stability and robustness of the weight representations. Furthermore, to\nfully leverage the continuity of the OSR and reduce precision loss, recognizing\nthe correlation between quantization sensitivity and weight variance, we\npropose a fine-grained, layer- and linear-wise OSR allocation strategy,\nMultiOSR. This strategy distributes OSR both across layers and within each\nlayer, based on weight variance and parameter scale. Finally, extensive\nexperiments on OPT and LLaMA model families demonstrate that SDQ-LLM achieves a\nmore efficient and high-precision performance even under highly aggressive\nlow-OSR settings.

In this\npaper, we set out to systematically and consistently benchmark various GNN\narchitectures in an RNN+GNN pipeline model. Specifically, to the best of our\nknowledge, we are the first to (i) propose to use GraphSAGE and Graph Attention\n(GAT, GATv2) in an RGNN for fault diagnosis, and (ii) provide a comprehensive\nbenchmark against earlier proposed RGNN solutions (RGCN) as well as pure RNN\nmodels (especially Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)), particularly (iii) exploring\ntheir generalization potential for deployment in different settings than those\nused for training them. Our experimental results on the IEEE 123-node\ndistribution network show that RGATv2 has superior generalization capabilities,\nmaintaining high performance with an F1-score reduction of $\\sim$12% across\ndifferent topology settings. In contrast, pure RNN models largely fail,\nexperiencing an F1-score reduction of up to $\\sim$60%, while other RGNN\nvariants also exhibit significant performance degradation, i.e., up to\n$\\sim$25% lower F1-scores."}

To address this, optimal control policies have been developed to\nenforce safety while ensuring high performance. Since basic first-principles\nmodels of real systems are often available, model-based controllers are widely\nused. Model predictive control (MPC) is a leading approach that optimizes\nperformance while explicitly handling safety constraints. However, obtaining\naccurate models for complex systems is difficult, which motivates data-driven\nalternatives. ML-based MPC leverages learned models to reduce reliance on\nhand-crafted dynamics, while reinforcement learning (RL) can learn near-optimal\npolicies directly from interaction data.

Crucially, we propose an innovative Parallel Slice Ranking Reward\n(PSRR) mechanism that computes ranking rewards in parallel slices, where each\nslice comprises same-indexed completions from different samples. This provides\na precise, differentiated learning signal for each individual completion,\nenabling granular credit assignment and effective optimization. On the official\nC-STS benchmark, PoLi-RL achieves a Spearman correlation coefficient of 48.18,\nestablishing a new SOTA for the cross-encoder architecture. As the first work\nto successfully apply RL to C-STS, our study introduces a powerful and precise\nparadigm for training LLMs on complex, ranking-based conditional judgment\ntasks."}

The result is an adaptive, momentum-based federated\nlearning algorithm in which the learning rates for clients and servers are\ndynamically adjusted and controlled by a single, global hyperparameter. By\ndesigning a fully integrated solution for both adaptive client updates and\ncentral agent aggregation, our method is capable of handling key challenges of\nheterogeneous federated learning, including objective inconsistency and client\ndrift.

We then generalize\nentanglement of purification to the multipartite case, where the gap between\ngeneralized entanglement of purification and its lower bound quantifies the\nquantum communication cost for distributing one part of the multipartite system\nto the other parts. We also demonstrate that a multipartite state is\n2-producible if and only if the generalized entanglement of purification gaps\nvanish. In addition, we show that the generalized entanglement of purification\ngaps are related to the local recoverability of the multipartite state from its\nmarginal state on some parts of the system and the distance between the state\nand the 2-producible states with the relative entropy. Moreover, we calculate\nthe generalized entanglement of purification gaps for the states fulfilling the\ngeneralized Schmidt decomposition, which implies that the 4-partite stabilizer\nstates do not always have the generalized Schmidt decomposition.

When training diffusion models for point clouds such as molecules\nand proteins, there is often no canonical orientation that can be assigned. To\ncapture this symmetry, the true data samples are often augmented by\ntransforming them with random rotations sampled uniformly over $SO(3)$. Then,\nthe denoised predictions are often rotationally aligned via the Kabsch-Umeyama\nalgorithm to the ground truth samples before computing the loss.

We describe Markovian open quantum system evolutions by Lie\nsemigroups, whose corresponding infinitesimal generators lie in a special type\nof convex cone - a Lie wedge. The Lie wedge associated to a given control\nsystem therefore consists of all generators of the quantum dynamical semigroup\nthat are physically realisable as a result of the interplay between the\ncoherent and incoherent processes the quantum system is subject to. For\n$n$-qubit open quantum systems, we provide a parametrisation of the largest\nphysically relevant Lie algebra (the system algebra), in which these Lie wedges\nare contained: the Lindblad-Kossakowski Lie algebra. This parametrisation\nprovides several useful benefits. First, it allows us to construct explicit\nforms of these system Lie wedges and their respective system Lie algebras.\nSecond, we analyse which control scenarios yield Lie wedges that are closed\nunder Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) multiplication and therefore generate\nMarkovian semigroups of time-independent quantum channels. Lie wedges of this\nform are called Lie semialgebras, and we completely solve this open problem by\nproving that Lie wedges specialise to this form only when the coherent controls\nhave no effect on both the inherent drift Hamiltonian and the incoherent part\nof the dynamics. Finally, this parametrisation of the Lindblad-Kossakowski Lie\nalgebra points to an intuitive separation between unital and non-unital\ndissipative dynamics, where the non-unital component of the dynamics is\ndescribed by affine translation operations. These translation operators are\nthen exploited to construct purely dissipative fixed-point engineering schemes\nto obtain either pure or mixed states as a system's unique fixed point."}

We present a structured empirical\nstudy that benchmarks a comprehensive set of pipelines, including (i) classical\nfilters, (ii) modern defogging networks, (iii) chained variants\n(filter$\\rightarrow$model, model$\\rightarrow$filter), and (iv) prompt-driven\nvisual--language image editing models (VLM) applied directly to foggy images.\nUsing Foggy Cityscapes, we assess both image quality and downstream performance\non object detection (mAP) and segmentation (PQ, RQ, SQ). Our analysis reveals\nwhen defogging helps, when chaining yields synergy or degradation, and how\nVLM-based editors compare to dedicated approaches. In addition, we evaluate\nqualitative rubric-based scores from a VLM judge and quantify their alignment\nwith task metrics, showing strong correlations with mAP. Together, these\nresults establish a transparent, task-oriented benchmark for defogging methods\nand highlight the conditions under which preprocessing genuinely improves\nautonomous perception in adverse weather."}

Currently, the\nmajority of existing methods utilize a generator to synthesize images to\nsupport the distillation. Although the current methods have achieved great\nsuccess, there are still many issues to be explored. Firstly, the outstanding\nperformance of supervised learning in deep learning drives us to explore a\npseudo-supervised paradigm on DFKD. Secondly, current synthesized methods\ncannot distinguish the distributions of different categories of samples, thus\nproducing ambiguous samples that may lead to an incorrect evaluation by the\nteacher. Besides, current methods cannot optimize the category-wise diversity\nsamples, which will hinder the student model learning from diverse samples and\nfurther achieving better performance. In this paper, to address the above\nlimitations, we propose a novel learning paradigm, i.e., conditional\npseudo-supervised contrast for data-free knowledge distillation~(CPSC-DFKD).\nThe primary innovations of CPSC-DFKD are: (1) introducing a conditional\ngenerative adversarial network to synthesize category-specific diverse images\nfor pseudo-supervised learning, (2) improving the modules of the generator to\ndistinguish the distributions of different categories, and (3) proposing\npseudo-supervised contrastive learning based on teacher and student views to\nenhance diversity.

It is\nknown that when the distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ has support $[N]$, the optimal\nsample complexity for the identity testing problem is roughly $O(\\sqrt{N})$.\nHowever, many distributions of interest, including those which can be sampled\nefficiently, have exponential support size, and therefore the optimal identity\ntester also requires exponential samples. In this paper, we bypass this lower\nbound by considering restricted settings. The above $O(\\sqrt{N})$ sample\ncomplexity identity tester is constructed so that it is not fooled by any (even\ninefficiently-sampled) distributions. However, in most applications, the\ndistributions under consideration are efficiently sampleable, and therefore it\nis enough to consider only identity testers that are not fooled by\nefficiently-sampled distributions. In that case, we can focus on efficient\nverification with efficient identity testers. We investigate relations between\nefficient verifications of classical/quantum distributions and\nclassical/quantum cryptography, and show the following results: (i) Every\nquantumly samplable distribution is verifiable with a $\\mathbf{P^{PP}}$\nalgorithm. (ii) If one-way functions exist, then no sufficiently random\nclassically samplable distribution is efficiently verifiable.

(iv) If QEFID pairs exist, then there exists a\nquantumly samplable distribution which is not efficiently verifiable.

Methodologically,\nMetaFind introduces a plug-and-play equivariant layout encoder ESSGNN that\ncaptures spatial relationships and object appearance features, ensuring\nretrieved 3D assets are contextually and stylistically coherent with the\nexisting scene, regardless of coordinate frame transformations. The framework\nsupports iterative scene construction by continuously adapting retrieval\nresults to current scene updates. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the\nimproved spatial and stylistic consistency of MetaFind in various retrieval\ntasks compared to baseline methods."}

Achieving an appropriate balance between enhancing the utility of model\noutputs and mitigating their potential for harm is a complex and persistent\nchallenge. Contemporary approaches frequently formalize this problem within the\nframework of Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) and employ\nestablished CMDP optimization techniques. However, these methods exhibit two\nnotable limitations. First, their reliance on reward and cost functions renders\nperformance highly sensitive to the underlying scoring mechanism, which must\ncapture semantic meaning rather than being triggered by superficial keywords.\nSecond, CMDP-based training entails tuning dual-variable, a process that is\nboth computationally expensive and does not provide any provable safety\nguarantee for a fixed dual variable that can be exploitable through adversarial\njailbreaks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Certifiable Safe-RLHF\n(CS-RLHF) that introduces a cost model trained on a large-scale corpus to\nassign semantically grounded safety scores. In contrast to the lagrangian-based\napproach, CS-RLHF adopts a rectified penalty-based formulation.

Its goal was to assess\nhow well current methods generalize to unseen clinical centers and adapt\nthrough local fine-tuning while enabling collaborative model development\nwithout sharing patient data. Methods: Participants developed strategies to\nclassify inflammation stages in appendicitis using a preliminary version of the\nmulti-center Appendix300 video dataset. The challenge evaluated two tasks:\ngeneralization to an unseen center and center-specific adaptation after\nfine-tuning. Submitted approaches included foundation models with linear\nprobing, metric learning with triplet loss, and various FL aggregation schemes\n(FedAvg, FedMedian, FedSAM). Performance was assessed using F1-score and\nExpected Cost, with ranking robustness evaluated via bootstrapping and\nstatistical testing. Results: In the generalization task, performance across\ncenters was limited. In the adaptation task, all teams improved after\nfine-tuning, though ranking stability was low. The ViViT-based submission\nachieved the strongest overall performance. The challenge highlighted\nlimitations in generalization, sensitivity to class imbalance, and difficulties\nin hyperparameter tuning in decentralized training, while spatiotemporal\nmodeling and context-aware preprocessing emerged as promising strategies.\nConclusion: The FedSurg Challenge establishes the first benchmark for\nevaluating FL strategies in surgical video classification.

Across models with up to 1.3B parameters trained on up to 138B\ntokens, the optimal learning rate/batch size pair $(\\eta^{\\ast}, B^{\\ast})$\nconsistently has the same operator norm value - a phenomenon we term norm\ntransfer.

It shows that cross-entropy loss\ndecreases in a predictable power-law rate as the model size increases. However,\nrecent evidence indicates that this law breaks down at very large scales: the\nloss decreases more slowly than expected, which causes significant trouble for\ndeveloping large language models. In this paper, we hypothesize that the root\ncause lies in the fact that cross-entropy itself does not truly scale; instead,\nonly one of its hidden components does. To investigate this, we introduce a\nnovel decomposition of cross-entropy into three parts: Error-Entropy,\nSelf-Alignment, and Confidence. We show both theoretically and empirically that\nthis decomposition precisely captures the training dynamics and optimization\nobjectives. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and 32 models\nspanning five orders of magnitude in size, we find that only error-entropy\nfollows a robust power-law scaling, while the other two terms remain largely\ninvariant. Moreover, error-entropy constitutes the dominant share of\ncross-entropy in small models but diminishes in proportion as models grow\nlarger. This explains why the cross-entropy scaling law appears accurate at\nsmall scales but fails at very large ones. Our findings establish the\nerror-entropy scaling law as a more accurate description of model behavior.

To address these limitations, we propose\nLLM-DAS, a novel framework that repositions the LLM from a ``data processor''\nto an ``algorithmist''.

The study uses event-centric metrics (cluster-based\nhits/misses/false alarms) and peak-conditional MASE (cMASE) in +/-Delta-hour\nwindows around state-level peaks (>= 50,000), with uncertainty quantified by\nhourly moving-block bootstrap.\n  On the test sample, Two-Stage detects more reference peaks across all windows\n(e.g., at +/-48 h it records 3/4 vs. 2/4; F1 66.7% vs. 57.1%) with one extra\nfalse alarm. Near peaks, it shows modest amplitude gains (2-3% lower cMASE at\n+/-0-12 h; bootstrap medians +9-13% at +/-6-12 h) but small losses at +/-36-48\nh (~3-4%). Overall, errors are comparable to the one-step LSTM baseline. SHAP\nanalysis confirms moisture-advection and wind/gust precursors, underscoring the\nvalue of the feature engineering.

We also contribute 28,000 frame-level action\nlabels and 1,194 video-level intention labels for the NuScenes dataset. Our\nresults show that LUR and RLUR achieve comparable in-distribution\nclassification performance to other LL-PDL approaches.

A Two-Stage Dynamic View", "comment": null, "summary": "The ongoing debate on whether reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards\n(RLVR) expands or shrinks the reasoning capabilities of large language models\n(LLMs) remains unresolved. Some studies contend that RLVR mainly improves\nsampling efficiency but at the expense of diversity and exploratory capacity,\nresulting in capability boundary shrinkage. In contrast, others demonstrate\nthat prolonged training can lead to the emergence of novel reasoning\nstrategies, suggesting capability boundary expansion. To reconcile these\ncontradictory findings, we theoretically and empirically show that both\nperspectives are partially valid-each aligning with a separate phase in an\ninherent two-stage probability mass dynamic: (1) Exploitation stage: initially,\nthe model primarily samples explored high-reward and low-reward tokens, while\nrarely selecting the potentially optimal token. Positive advantage estimates\nincrease the probability of high-reward tokens and decrease those of low-reward\ntokens, yet the optimal token's probability remains largely unchanged during\nthis stage. (2) Exploration stage: as training advances, the growth rate of\npreviously acquired high-reward tokens slows as their probabilities approach\nsaturation. When a potentially optimal token-now receiving positive advantage\nestimates-is occasionally sampled, its probability increases, while those of\nthe originally high-reward tokens decrease. This dynamic suggests that\nover-exploitation during the exploitation stage may lead to capability boundary\nshrinkage, whereas prolonged training into the exploration stage can promote an\nexpansion of the reasoning capability boundary. Building upon our insights, we\nrevisit the potential of only using relative negative gradients for prolonging\ntraining, providing a theoretical and empirical foundation for the development\nof more advanced reasoning capabilities."}

However,\nrecent evidence indicates that this law breaks down at very large scales: the\nloss decreases more slowly than expected, which causes significant trouble for\ndeveloping large language models. In this paper, we hypothesize that the root\ncause lies in the fact that cross-entropy itself does not truly scale; instead,\nonly one of its hidden components does. To investigate this, we introduce a\nnovel decomposition of cross-entropy into three parts: Error-Entropy,\nSelf-Alignment, and Confidence. We show both theoretically and empirically that\nthis decomposition precisely captures the training dynamics and optimization\nobjectives. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and 32 models\nspanning five orders of magnitude in size, we find that only error-entropy\nfollows a robust power-law scaling, while the other two terms remain largely\ninvariant. Moreover, error-entropy constitutes the dominant share of\ncross-entropy in small models but diminishes in proportion as models grow\nlarger. This explains why the cross-entropy scaling law appears accurate at\nsmall scales but fails at very large ones. Our findings establish the\nerror-entropy scaling law as a more accurate description of model behavior.

Building on\nit, we train a unified model that integrates a VLM with FLUX.1 Kontext via a\nlightweight connector for enhanced multimodal understanding. A three-stage\ntraining curriculum enables progressive feature alignment, knowledge infusion,\nand reasoning-augmented generation, further boosted by an external reasoner at\ninference time. Finally, we introduce StructBench, a novel benchmark for\ngeneration and editing with over 1,700 challenging instances, and an\naccompanying evaluation metric, StructScore, which employs a multi-round Q\\&A\nprotocol to assess fine-grained factual accuracy. Evaluations of 15 models\nreveal that even leading closed-source systems remain far from satisfactory.\nOur model attains strong editing performance, and inference-time reasoning\nyields consistent gains across diverse architectures. By releasing the dataset,\nmodel, and benchmark, we aim to advance unified multimodal foundations for\nstructured visuals."}

Moreover,\nto enhance image generation quality, 3Dify allows users to provide feedback by\nselecting preferred images from multiple candidates. The LLM then learns\nvariable patterns from these selections and applies them to subsequent\ngenerations. Furthermore, 3Dify supports the integration of locally deployed\nLLMs, enabling users to utilize custom-developed models and to reduce both time\nand monetary costs associated with external API calls by leveraging their own\ncomputational resources."}

However, this approach\ncan be sub-optimal, as a single, uniform weight may not be sufficient for\ndomains with very few interactions, where the training signal is easily diluted\nby the vast, generic dataset.\n  This paper proposes a novel, data-driven approach: a Dynamic Weighted Loss\nfunction with comprehensive theoretical foundations and extensive empirical\nvalidation. We introduce an adaptive algorithm that adjusts the loss weight for\neach domain based on its sparsity in the training data, assigning a higher\nweight to sparser domains and a lower weight to denser ones. This ensures that\neven rare user interests contribute a meaningful gradient signal, preventing\nthem from being overshadowed.\n  We provide rigorous theoretical analysis including convergence proofs,\ncomplexity analysis, and bounds analysis to establish the stability and\nefficiency of our approach. Our comprehensive empirical validation across four\ndiverse datasets (MovieLens, Amazon Electronics, Yelp Business, LastFM Music)\nwith state-of-the-art baselines (SIGMA, CALRec, SparseEnNet) demonstrates that\nthis dynamic weighting system significantly outperforms all comparison methods,\nparticularly for sparse domains, achieving substantial lifts in key metrics\nlike Recall at 10 and NDCG at 10 while maintaining performance on denser\ndomains and introducing minimal computational overhead."}

Unlike conventional\npost-hoc methods, provenance networks learn to link each prediction directly to\nits supporting training examples as part of the model's normal operation,\nembedding interpretability into the architecture itself. Conceptually, the\nmodel operates similarly to a learned KNN, where each output is justified by\nconcrete exemplars weighted by relevance in the feature space.

However, its application in conversational AI is\nfundamentally constrained by its stateless nature and the quadratic\ncomputational complexity ($O(L^2)$) with respect to sequence length $L$.\nCurrent models emulate memory by reprocessing an ever-expanding conversation\nhistory with each turn, leading to prohibitive costs and latency in long\ndialogues. This paper introduces the Reactive Transformer (RxT), a novel\narchitecture designed to overcome these limitations by shifting from a\ndata-driven to an event-driven paradigm. RxT processes each conversational turn\nas a discrete event in real-time, maintaining context in an integrated,\nfixed-size Short-Term Memory (STM) system. The architecture features a distinct\noperational cycle where a generator-decoder produces a response based on the\ncurrent query and the previous memory state, after which a memory-encoder and a\ndedicated Memory Attention network asynchronously update the STM with a\nrepresentation of the complete interaction. This design fundamentally alters\nthe scaling dynamics, reducing the total user-facing cost of a conversation\nfrom quadratic ($O(N^2 \\cdot T)$) to linear ($O(N \\cdot T)$) with respect to\nthe number of interactions $N$.

The ease of synthesizing from a generative model suggests using\n(unverified) synthetic data to augment a limited corpus of real data for the\npurpose of fine-tuning in the hope of improving performance. Unfortunately,\nhowever, the resulting positive feedback loop leads to model autophagy disorder\n(MAD, aka model collapse) that results in a rapid degradation in sample quality\nand/or diversity. In this paper, we introduce Neon (for Negative Extrapolation\nfrOm self-traiNing), a new learning method that turns the degradation from\nself-training into a powerful signal for self-improvement. Given a base model,\nNeon first fine-tunes it on its own self-synthesized data but then,\ncounterintuitively, reverses its gradient updates to extrapolate away from the\ndegraded weights. We prove that Neon works because typical inference samplers\nthat favor high-probability regions create a predictable anti-alignment between\nthe synthetic and real data population gradients, which negative extrapolation\ncorrects to better align the model with the true data distribution. Neon is\nremarkably easy to implement via a simple post-hoc merge that requires no new\nreal data, works effectively with as few as 1k synthetic samples, and typically\nuses less than 1% additional training compute. We demonstrate Neon's\nuniversality across a range of architectures (diffusion, flow matching,\nautoregressive, and inductive moment matching models) and datasets (ImageNet,\nCIFAR-10, and FFHQ).

The dynamics of those\nagents strongly depends on their tasks, roles, or observable labels.\nClass-conditioned motion prediction is thus an appealing way to reduce forecast\nuncertainty and get more accurate predictions for heterogeneous agents.\nHowever, this is hardly explored in the prior art, especially for mobile robots\nand in limited data applications. In this paper, we analyse different\nclass-conditioned trajectory prediction methods on two datasets. We propose a\nset of conditional pattern-based and efficient deep learning-based baselines,\nand evaluate their performance on robotics and outdoors datasets (TH\\\"OR-MAGNI\nand Stanford Drone Dataset). Our experiments show that all methods improve\naccuracy in most of the settings when considering class labels. More\nimportantly, we observe that there are significant differences when learning\nfrom imbalanced datasets, or in new environments where sufficient data is not\navailable.

Code available at:\n  https://github.com/sirraya-tech/Sirraya_LSD_Code", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce fluent yet factually incorrect\nstatements-a phenomenon known as hallucination-posing serious risks in\nhigh-stakes domains. We present Layer-wise Semantic Dynamics (LSD), a geometric\nframework for hallucination detection that analyzes the evolution of\nhidden-state semantics across transformer layers. Unlike prior methods that\nrely on multiple sampling passes or external verification sources, LSD operates\nintrinsically within the model's representational space. Using margin-based\ncontrastive learning, LSD aligns hidden activations with ground-truth\nembeddings derived from a factual encoder, revealing a distinct separation in\nsemantic trajectories: factual responses preserve stable alignment, while\nhallucinations exhibit pronounced semantic drift across depth. Evaluated on the\nTruthfulQA and synthetic factual-hallucination datasets, LSD achieves an\nF1-score of 0.92, AUROC of 0.96, and clustering accuracy of 0.89, outperforming\nSelfCheckGPT and Semantic Entropy baselines while requiring only a single\nforward pass. This efficiency yields a 5-20x speedup over sampling-based\nmethods without sacrificing precision or interpretability. LSD offers a\nscalable, model-agnostic mechanism for real-time hallucination monitoring and\nprovides new insights into the geometry of factual consistency within large\nlanguage models."}

To address\nthese issues, advancing Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex reasoning\ntasks requires innovative approaches that bridge intuitive and deliberate\ncognitive processes, akin to human cognition's dual-system dynamic.

While Active Learning (AL) offers a\nstrategic solution by labeling only the most informative and representative\ndata, its iterative nature still necessitates significant human involvement.\nUnsupervised Active Learning (UAL) presents an alternative by shifting the\nannotation burden to a single, post-selection step. Unfortunately, prevailing\nUAL methods struggle to achieve state-of-the-art performance. These approaches\ntypically rely on local, gradient-based scoring for sample importance\nestimation, which not only makes them vulnerable to ambiguous and noisy data\nbut also hinders their capacity to select samples that adequately represent the\nfull data distribution. Moreover, their use of shallow, one-shot linear\nselection falls short of a true UAL paradigm. In this paper, we propose the\nNatural Feature Progressive Framework (NFPF), a UAL method that revolutionizes\nhow sample importance is measured. At its core, NFPF employs a Specific Feature\nLearning Machine (SFLM) to effectively quantify each sample's contribution to\nmodel performance. We further utilize the SFLM to define a powerful\nReconstruction Difference metric for initial sample selection. Our\ncomprehensive experiments show that NFPF significantly outperforms all\nestablished UAL methods and achieves performance on par with supervised AL\nmethods on vision datasets. Detailed ablation studies and qualitative\nvisualizations provide compelling evidence for NFPF's superior performance,\nenhanced robustness, and improved data distribution coverage."}

However, themes such as aspirational goals or family support are\noften woven into narratives, rather than appearing as direct keywords. This\nmakes them difficult to detect for standard NLP models that process sentences\nin isolation. The core challenge stems from a lack of awareness, as standard\nmodels are pre-trained on general corpora, leaving them blind to the\ndomain-specific language and narrative context inherent to the data. To address\nthis, we introduce AWARE, a framework that systematically attempts to improve a\ntransformer model's awareness for this nuanced task. AWARE has three core\ncomponents: 1) Domain Awareness, adapting the model's vocabulary to the\nlinguistic style of student reflections; 2) Context Awareness, generating\nsentence embeddings that are aware of the full essay context; and 3) Class\nOverlap Awareness, employing a multi-label strategy to recognize the\ncoexistence of themes in a single sentence.

However, such an encoding paradigm becomes less effective as\ninstructions become more complex and require compositional reasoning. Inspired\nby the proven effectiveness of chain-of-thought reasoning, we propose a general\nThink-Then-Embed (TTE) framework for UME, composed of a reasoner and an\nembedder.

This\nexplicit reasoning step enables more nuanced understanding of complex\nmultimodal instructions. Our contributions are threefold. First, by leveraging\na powerful MLLM reasoner, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the\nMMEB-V2 benchmark, surpassing proprietary models trained on massive in-house\ndatasets.
