Yet their effectiveness depends on sustained compliance\nsupported by institutions, especially in one-off interactions. Despite advances\nin quantitative studies of cooperation and commitment, most applied analyses\nand policy debates remain largely qualitative, with limited attention to the\nallocation of scarce institutional resources between enhancing participation\nand ensuring commitment compliance. Herein, we develop an evolutionary\ngame-theoretic model that explicitly examines the strategic distribution of a\nlimited budget for institutional incentives, namely rewards or punishments,\naimed at these two critical objectives within pre-commitment frameworks. Our\nfindings reveal that a reward-based incentive approach consistently yields\ngreater coordination success than a punishment-based approach, with optimal\noutcomes arising when resources are appropriately distributed between\nparticipation promotion and compliance assurance.

Our first contribution is an interesting\nobservation that the SOTA solution, AGP-Static, can be adapted to support\ndynamic parameterized queries; however several challenges remain unresolved.\nFirstly, the query time complexity of AGP-Static is based on an assumption of\nusing an optimal algorithm for subset sampling in its query algorithm.\nUnfortunately, back to that time, such an algorithm did not exist; without such\nan optimal algorithm, an extra $O(\\log^2 n)$ factor is required in the query\ncomplexity, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the graphs. Secondly,\nAGP-Static performs poorly on dynamic graphs, taking $O(n\\log n)$ time to\nprocess each update. To address these challenges, we propose a new algorithm,\nAGP-Static++, which is simpler yet reduces roughly a factor of $O(\\log^2 n)$ in\nthe query complexity while preserving the approximation guarantees of\nAGP-Static.

In such contexts,\nNegation-as-Failure is commonly used to infer negative information from the\nlack of positive evidence. However, open and distributed systems such as IoT\nnetworks or the Semantic Web Negation-as-Failure semantics become unreliable\ndue to incomplete and asynchronous data. This has led to a growing interest in\nnegation-free fragments of temporal rule-based systems, which preserve\nmonotonicity and enable scalable reasoning.\n  This paper investigates the expressive power of negation-free MTL, a temporal\nlogic framework designed for rule-based reasoning over time. We show that the\n\"always\" operators of MTL, often treated as syntactic sugar for combinations of\nother temporal constructs, can be eliminated using \"once\", \"since\" and \"until\"\noperators. Remarkably, even the \"once\" operators can be removed, yielding a\nfragment based solely on \"until\" and \"since\". These results challenge the\nassumption that negation is necessary for expressing universal temporal\nconstraints, and reveal a robust fragment capable of capturing both existential\nand invariant temporal patterns.

In blockchains based on SMR, however, order\nmatters, since different orders could provide their clients with different\nfinancial rewards. Ordered consensus augments the specification of SMR to\ninclude specific guarantees on such order, with a focus on limiting the\ninfluence of Byzantine nodes. Real-world ordering manipulations, however, can\nand do happen even without Byzantine replicas, typically because of factors,\nsuch as faster networks or closer proximity to the blockchain infrastructure,\nthat give some clients an unfair advantage. To address this challenge, this\npaper proceeds to extend ordered consensus by requiring it to also support\nequal opportunity, a concrete notion of fairness, widely adopted in social\nsciences. Informally, equal opportunity requires that two candidates who,\naccording to a set of criteria deemed to be relevant, are equally qualified for\na position (in our case, a specific slot in the SMR total order), should have\nan equal chance of landing it. We show how randomness can be leveraged to keep\nbias in check, and, to this end, introduce the secret random oracle (SRO), a\nsystem component that generates randomness in a fault-tolerant manner.

A lightweight deep neural network\noriginally developed for adult EEG sleep staging was trained on the ovine EEG\nusing transfer learning from adult EEG. A spectral equalisation-based domain\nadaptation strategy was used to reduce cross-domain mismatch.\n  Results: We demonstrated that while direct transfer performed poorly, full\nfine tuning combined with spectral equalisation achieved the best overall\nperformance (accuracy: 86.6 percent, macro F1-score: 62.5), outperforming\nbaseline models.\n  Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, FetalSleepNet is the first deep\nlearning framework specifically developed for automated sleep staging from the\nfetal EEG.

To\nutilize these devices for force sensing or quantum optomechanics, they must be\nbrought in close proximity with other systems for functionalization or\nefficient readout. Improved understanding of the loss mechanisms in\nnanomechanical resonators, specifically the advent of dissipation dilution, has\nled to the development of resonators with unprecedented coherence properties.\nThe mechanical quality factors of this new class of ultracoherent micro- and\nnanomechanical oscillators can now exceed 1 billion at room temperature,\nsetting their force sensitivities below 1 $\\mathrm{aN}/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$,\nsurpassing those of the state-of-the-art atomic force microscopes (AFMs). Given\nthis new regime of sensitivity, an intriguing question is whether the proximity\nof other materials hinders mechanical coherence. Here we show: it does. We\nreport a novel dissipation mechanism that occurs in ultracoherent\nnanomechanical oscillators caused by the presence of nearby dielectrics. By\nstudying the parameter scaling of the effect, we show that the mechanism is\nmore severe for low-frequency mechanical modes and that it is due to dielectric\nloss within the materials caused by the motion of a resonator which carries\nstatic charges. Our observations are consistent with the noncontact friction\n(NCF) observed in AFMs. Our findings provide insights into limitations on the\nintegration of ultracoherent nanomechanical resonators and highlight the\nadverse effects of charged defects in these systems."}

Previous methods typically transform the ground image into a bird's-eye\nview (BEV) representation and then align it with the aerial image for\nlocalization. However, this transformation often leads to information loss due\nto perspective distortion or compression of height information, thereby\ndegrading alignment quality with the aerial view. In contrast, our method\ndirectly establishes correspondences between ground and aerial images and lifts\nonly the matched keypoints to BEV space using monocular depth prior. Notably,\nmodern depth predictors can provide reliable metric depth when the test samples\nare similar to the training data. When the depth distribution differs, they\nstill produce consistent relative depth, i.e., depth accurate up to an unknown\nscale. Our method supports both metric and relative depth. It employs a\nscale-aware Procrustes alignment to estimate the camera pose from the\ncorrespondences and optionally recover the scale when using relative depth.\nExperimental results demonstrate that, with only weak supervision on camera\npose, our method learns accurate local feature correspondences and achieves\nsuperior localization performance under challenging conditions, such as\ncross-area generalization and unknown orientation.

The so-called Bruckner test is traditionally performed by\nophthalmologists in clinical settings.

In this paper, we present a\nfirst study conducted during the development of KidsVisionCheck, a free\napplication that can perform vision screening with a mobile device using\nred-eye reflex images. The underlying model relies on deep neural networks\ntrained on children's pupil images collected and labeled by an ophthalmologist.\nWith an accuracy of 90% on unseen test data, our model provides highly reliable\nperformance without the necessity of specialist equipment. Furthermore, we can\nidentify the optimal conditions for data collection, which can in turn be used\nto provide immediate feedback to the users.

Existing zero-shot VLN methods are mainly designed for\ndiscrete environments or involve unsupervised training in continuous simulator\nenvironments, which makes it challenging to generalize and deploy them in\nreal-world scenarios. To achieve a training-free framework in continuous\nenvironments, our framework formulates navigation guidance as graph constraint\noptimization by decomposing instructions into explicit spatial constraints. The\nconstraint-driven paradigm decodes spatial semantics through constraint\nsolving, enabling zero-shot adaptation to unseen environments. Specifically, we\nconstruct a spatial constraint library covering all types of spatial\nrelationship mentioned in VLN instructions. The human instruction is decomposed\ninto a directed acyclic graph, with waypoint nodes, object nodes and edges,\nwhich are used as queries to retrieve the library to build the graph\nconstraints. The graph constraint optimization is solved by the constraint\nsolver to determine the positions of waypoints, obtaining the robot's\nnavigation path and final goal. To handle cases of no solution or multiple\nsolutions, we construct a navigation tree and the backtracking mechanism.\nExtensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate significant\nimprovements in success rate and navigation efficiency compared to\nstate-of-the-art zero-shot VLN methods. We further conduct real-world\nexperiments to show that our framework can effectively generalize to new\nenvironments and instruction sets, paving the way for a more robust and\nautonomous navigation framework."}

In particular, we can show that, for relevant robustnesses, sets of\nanticommuting observables give rise to the most incompatible dichotomic\nmeasurements. We also formalise the construction of such universal parent\nmeasurements in the framework of sum-of-squares optimisation and obtain\npreliminary numerical results demonstrating the power of the method by\nimproving on our own analytical values. All results find direct application for\ndemonstrating genuine high-dimensional steering, that is, certifying the\ndimensionality of a quantum system in a one-sided device-independent manner."}

Recent efforts have mitigated this issue by\nquantizing model updates to reduce communication costs. However, most existing\nmethods apply quantization only after local training, introducing quantization\nerrors into the trained parameters and potentially degrading model accuracy. In\nthis paper, we propose Federated Bit Freezing (FedBiF), a novel FL framework\nthat directly learns quantized model parameters during local training.

In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive\ncomparative analysis of the two types of questionnaires. Our analysis reveals\nthat established questionnaires (1) yield substantially different profiles of\nLLMs from ecologically valid ones, deviating from the psychological\ncharacteristics expressed in the context of user queries, (2) suffer from\ninsufficient items for stable measurement, (3) create misleading impressions\nthat LLMs possess stable constructs, and (4) yield exaggerated profiles for\npersona-prompted LLMs. Overall, our work cautions against the use of\nestablished psychological questionnaires for LLMs. Our code will be released\nupon publication."}

To impose\ncross-modal semantic alignment, the model integrates a cross-modal interaction\nmodule to bridge the semantic representation between image and text via\nmulti-head attention. Meanwhile, in the generation module, the introduced modal\nattention gating mechanism dynamically controls the role of visual evidence and\ntext prior information during generation. The entire framework takes end-to-end\ntraining, and combines the comparison loss, the retrieval loss and the\ngeneration loss to form multi-task optimization objectives, and achieves image\nunderstanding and policy matching in collaborative learning. The results\ndemonstrate superior performance in retrieval accuracy and classification index\non damage severity, where the Top-1 retrieval accuracy has been improved by\n9.6%."}

We argue that the heterogeneity in node types, nodal features, and\nlocal neighborhood topology poses significant challenges for ensemble learning,\nparticularly in accommodating diverse graph learners. Our HGEN framework\nensembles multiple learners through a meta-path and transformation-based\noptimization pipeline to uplift classification accuracy. Specifically, HGEN\nuses meta-path combined with random dropping to create Allele Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs), whereby the base graph learners are trained and aligned for\nlater ensembling. To ensure effective ensemble learning, HGEN presents two key\ncomponents: 1) a residual-attention mechanism to calibrate allele GNNs of\ndifferent meta-paths, thereby enforcing node embeddings to focus on more\ninformative graphs to improve base learner accuracy, and 2) a\ncorrelation-regularization term to enlarge the disparity among embedding\nmatrices generated from different meta-paths, thereby enriching base learner\ndiversity. We analyze the convergence of HGEN and attest its higher\nregularization magnitude over simple voting. Experiments on five heterogeneous\nnetworks validate that HGEN consistently outperforms its state-of-the-art\ncompetitors by substantial margin."}

The proposed approach aims to overcome the limitations of traditional\nsystems, which rely on manual tuning of behavior scenarios. These limitations\ninclude manual configuration, low flexibility, and lack of naturalness in robot\nbehavior. The process of preparing tour scenarios is implemented through a\ntwo-stage generation: first, a stylized narrative is created, then non-verbal\naction tags are integrated into the text. The multi-agent system ensures\ncoordination and conflict resolution during the execution of parallel actions,\nas well as maintaining default behavior after the completion of main\noperations, contributing to more natural robot behavior. The results obtained\nfrom the trial demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach for\nautomating and scaling social robot control systems."}

However, it remains unclear how established questionnaires and\necologically valid questionnaires differ in their outcomes, and what insights\nthese differences may provide. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive\ncomparative analysis of the two types of questionnaires. Our analysis reveals\nthat established questionnaires (1) yield substantially different profiles of\nLLMs from ecologically valid ones, deviating from the psychological\ncharacteristics expressed in the context of user queries, (2) suffer from\ninsufficient items for stable measurement, (3) create misleading impressions\nthat LLMs possess stable constructs, and (4) yield exaggerated profiles for\npersona-prompted LLMs. Overall, our work cautions against the use of\nestablished psychological questionnaires for LLMs. Our code will be released\nupon publication."}

By\nleveraging the prior knowledge about the multi-view imaging process of\nmammograms, our model learns local cross-view alignments and fine-grained local\nfeatures through joint global and local, visual-visual, and visual-language\ncontrastive learning. Pretrained on EMBED [14], one of the largest open\nmammography datasets, our model outperforms baselines across multiple datasets\nunder different settings."}

Consequently, a model\nequipped with visual grounding capabilities can target a wide range of\napplications in various domains, including referring expression comprehension,\nanswering questions pertinent to fine-grained details in images or videos,\ncaption visual context by explicitly referring to entities, as well as low and\nhigh-level control in simulated and real environments. In this survey paper, we\nreview representative works across the key areas of research on modern\ngeneral-purpose vision language models (VLMs). We first outline the importance\nof grounding in VLMs, then delineate the core components of the contemporary\nparadigm for developing grounded models, and examine their practical\napplications, including benchmarks and evaluation metrics for grounded\nmultimodal generation. We also discuss the multifaceted interrelations among\nvisual grounding, multimodal chain-of-thought, and reasoning in VLMs. Finally,\nwe analyse the challenges inherent to visual grounding and suggest promising\ndirections for future research."}

We\npresent Contrasting by Patient Augmented Electrocardiograms (CAPE) foundation\nmodel and pretrain on four cohorts (n = 5,203,352), from diverse populations\nacross three continents (North America, South America, Asia). We systematically\nassess how cohort demographics, health status, and population diversity\ninfluence the downstream performance for prediction tasks also including two\nadditional cohorts from another continent (Europe). We find that downstream\nperformance depends on the distributional properties of the pretraining cohort,\nincluding demographics and health status. Moreover, while pretraining with a\nmulti-centre, demographically diverse cohort improves in-distribution accuracy,\nit reduces out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation of our contrastive approach\nby encoding cohort-specific artifacts. To address this, we propose the\nIn-Distribution Batch (IDB) strategy, which preserves intra-cohort consistency\nduring pretraining and enhances OOD robustness.

Nevertheless, current approaches remain\nvulnerable to challenging conditions such as poor lighting, occlusions, and\nadverse weather. To address these limitations, multimodal methods that\nintegrate auxiliary sensor data (e.g., LiDAR, infrared) have recently emerged,\nproviding complementary information that enhances robustness. In this work, we\npresent MM SAM-adapter, a novel framework that extends the capabilities of the\nSegment Anything Model (SAM) for multimodal semantic segmentation. The proposed\nmethod employs an adapter network that injects fused multimodal features into\nSAM's rich RGB features. This design enables the model to retain the strong\ngeneralization ability of RGB features while selectively incorporating\nauxiliary modalities only when they contribute additional cues. As a result, MM\nSAM-adapter achieves a balanced and efficient use of multimodal information. We\nevaluate our approach on three challenging benchmarks, DeLiVER, FMB, and MUSES,\nwhere MM SAM-adapter delivers state-of-the-art performance. To further analyze\nmodality contributions, we partition DeLiVER and FMB into RGB-easy and RGB-hard\nsubsets. Results consistently demonstrate that our framework outperforms\ncompeting methods in both favorable and adverse conditions, highlighting the\neffectiveness of multimodal adaptation for robust scene understanding.

This has led to\nclaims about these model's ability to solve (learn) unseen tasks with only a\nfew shots (exemplars) in the prompt. However, deduction does not always imply\nlearning, as ICL does not explicitly encode a given observation. Instead, the\nmodels rely on their prior knowledge and the exemplars given, if any. We argue\nthat, mathematically, ICL does constitute learning, but its full\ncharacterisation requires empirical work. We then carry out a large-scale\nanalysis of ICL ablating out or accounting for memorisation, pretraining,\ndistributional shifts, and prompting style and phrasing. We find that ICL is an\neffective learning paradigm, but limited in its ability to learn and generalise\nto unseen tasks. We note that, in the limit where exemplars become more\nnumerous, accuracy is insensitive to exemplar distribution, model, prompt\nstyle, and the input's linguistic features. Instead, it deduces patterns from\nregularities in the prompt, which leads to distributional sensitivity,\nespecially in prompting styles such as chain-of-thought. Given the varied\naccuracies on formally similar tasks, we conclude that autoregression's ad-hoc\nencoding is not a robust mechanism, and suggests limited all-purpose\ngeneralisability."}
