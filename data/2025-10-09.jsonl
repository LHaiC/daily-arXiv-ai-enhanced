When this throughput need exceeds the\ncapacity of the machine hosting the structure, one either needs to replace the\nunderlying hardware (an option that is typically not viable and introduces a\nlong down time) or make the data structure distributed. Static partitioning of\nthe data structure for distribution is not desirable, as it is prone to uneven\nload distribution over time, and having to change the partitioning scheme later\nwill require downtime.\n  Since a distributed data structure, inherently, relies on communication\nsupport from the network stack and operating systems, we introduce the notion\nof conditional lock-freedom that extends the notion of lock-free computation\nwith reasonable assumptions about communication between processes. We present\nDiLi, a conditional lock-free, linearizable, and distributable linked list that\ncan be asynchronously and dynamically (1) partitioned into multiple sublists\nand (2) load balanced by distributing sublists across multiple machines. DiLi\ncontains primitives for these that also maintain the lock-free property of the\nunderlying search structure that supports find, remove, and insert of a key as\nthe client operations.\n  Searching for an item in DiLi is by a novel traversal that involves a binary\nsearch on the partitioning scheme, and then a linear traversal on a limitable\nnumber of linked nodes.

Unlike conventional leader-follower schemes that fix the\nfollower's position relative to the leader, the follower is steered to maintain\nrange and bearing angles (which is the angle between its velocity vector and\nits line-of-sight (LOS) with respect to the leader) arbitrarily close to the\nprescribed values, enabling the follower to maintain formation on a\nhemispherical region behind the leader. The proposed IGC framework directly\nmaps leader-follower relative range dynamics to throttle commands, and the\nfollower's velocity orientation relative to the LOS to aerodynamic control\nsurface deflections. This enables synergism between guidance and control\nsubsystems. The control design uses a dynamic surface control-based\nbackstepping approach to achieve convergence to the desired formation set,\nwhere Lyapunov barrier functions are incorporated to ensure the follower's\nbearing angle is constrained within specified bounds. Rigorous stability\nanalysis guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness of all error states and strict\nconstraint satisfaction in the presence of aerodynamic nonlinearities. The\nproposed flexible formation scheme allows the follower to have an orientation\nmismatch relative to the leader to execute anticipatory reconfiguration by\ntransitioning between the relative positions in the admissible formation set\nwhen the leader aggressively maneuvers. The proposed IGC law relies only on\nrelative information and onboard sensors without the information about the\nleader's maneuver, making it suitable for GPS-denied or non-cooperative\nscenarios.

We address this gap by systematically\ncomparing hidden representations using the Information Imbalance, a\ncomputationally efficient proxy of conditional mutual information. Through this\nanalysis, we observe that the information content of the hidden representations\nfollows a double descent as a function of the number of network parameters,\nakin to the behavior of the test error.

Our\nresults indicate that the representations of overparameterized networks are\nrobust to label noise.

The proposed IGC framework directly\nmaps leader-follower relative range dynamics to throttle commands, and the\nfollower's velocity orientation relative to the LOS to aerodynamic control\nsurface deflections. This enables synergism between guidance and control\nsubsystems.

While many studies have demonstrated\nperformance benefits of combining multiple model predictions, existing\nstrategies using linear pooling methods (ranging from simple averaging to\ndynamic weight updates) face a key limitation. Dynamic prediction combinations\nthat rely on historical performance to update weights are necessarily reactive.\nDue to the need to average over a reasonable number of epochs (with moving\naverages or exponential weighting), they tend to be slow to adjust to changing\ncircumstances (phase or regime changes). In this work, we develop a model that\nuses machine learning to forecast the performance of predictions by models at\neach epoch in a time series. This enables `context-awareness' by assigning\nhigher weight to models that are likely to be more accurate at a given time. We\nshow that adding a performance forecasting worker in a decentralized learning\nnetwork, following a design similar to the Allora network, can improve the\naccuracy of network inferences. Specifically, we find forecasting models that\npredict regret (performance relative to the network inference) or regret\nz-score (performance relative to other workers) show greater improvement than\nmodels predicting losses, which often do not outperform the naive network\ninference (historically weighted average of all inferences). Through a series\nof optimization tests, we show that the performance of the forecasting model\ncan be sensitive to choices in the feature set and number of training epochs.\nThese properties may depend on the exact problem and should be tailored to each\ndomain. Although initially designed for a decentralized learning network, using\nperformance forecasting for prediction combination may be useful in any\nsituation where predictive rather than reactive model weighting is needed."}

It is common to train deep\nlearning models for denoising using the mean-squared error (MSE) loss, which\ncorresponds to computing the posterior mean $\\mathbb{E}[x \\mid y]$. When the\nnoise is Gaussian, Tweedie's formula enables approximation of the posterior\ndistribution through its higher-order moments.

In real-world datasets, these labels are often noisy due to\nannotation errors. While the impact of label noise on the performance of deep\nlearning models has been widely studied, its effects on the networks' hidden\nrepresentations remain poorly understood. We address this gap by systematically\ncomparing hidden representations using the Information Imbalance, a\ncomputationally efficient proxy of conditional mutual information. Through this\nanalysis, we observe that the information content of the hidden representations\nfollows a double descent as a function of the number of network parameters,\nakin to the behavior of the test error. We further demonstrate that in the\nunderparameterized regime, representations learned with noisy labels are more\ninformative than those learned with clean labels, while in the\noverparameterized regime, these representations are equally informative. Our\nresults indicate that the representations of overparameterized networks are\nrobust to label noise. We also found that the information imbalance between the\npenultimate and pre-softmax layers decreases with cross-entropy loss in the\noverparameterized regime. This offers a new perspective on understanding\ngeneralization in classification tasks.

While many studies have demonstrated\nperformance benefits of combining multiple model predictions, existing\nstrategies using linear pooling methods (ranging from simple averaging to\ndynamic weight updates) face a key limitation. Dynamic prediction combinations\nthat rely on historical performance to update weights are necessarily reactive.\nDue to the need to average over a reasonable number of epochs (with moving\naverages or exponential weighting), they tend to be slow to adjust to changing\ncircumstances (phase or regime changes). In this work, we develop a model that\nuses machine learning to forecast the performance of predictions by models at\neach epoch in a time series.

We\nshow that adding a performance forecasting worker in a decentralized learning\nnetwork, following a design similar to the Allora network, can improve the\naccuracy of network inferences. Specifically, we find forecasting models that\npredict regret (performance relative to the network inference) or regret\nz-score (performance relative to other workers) show greater improvement than\nmodels predicting losses, which often do not outperform the naive network\ninference (historically weighted average of all inferences). Through a series\nof optimization tests, we show that the performance of the forecasting model\ncan be sensitive to choices in the feature set and number of training epochs.\nThese properties may depend on the exact problem and should be tailored to each\ndomain.

To assess these\ncluster paths, we introduce four metrics: path complexity (cognitive load),\nweighted-path purity (class alignment), decision-alignment faithfulness\n(predictive fidelity), and path agreement (stability under perturbations). In a\nspurious-cue CIFAR-10 experiment, cluster paths identify color-based shortcuts\nand collapse when the cue is removed.

Unlike conventional leader-follower schemes that fix the\nfollower's position relative to the leader, the follower is steered to maintain\nrange and bearing angles (which is the angle between its velocity vector and\nits line-of-sight (LOS) with respect to the leader) arbitrarily close to the\nprescribed values, enabling the follower to maintain formation on a\nhemispherical region behind the leader. The proposed IGC framework directly\nmaps leader-follower relative range dynamics to throttle commands, and the\nfollower's velocity orientation relative to the LOS to aerodynamic control\nsurface deflections. This enables synergism between guidance and control\nsubsystems. The control design uses a dynamic surface control-based\nbackstepping approach to achieve convergence to the desired formation set,\nwhere Lyapunov barrier functions are incorporated to ensure the follower's\nbearing angle is constrained within specified bounds. Rigorous stability\nanalysis guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness of all error states and strict\nconstraint satisfaction in the presence of aerodynamic nonlinearities. The\nproposed flexible formation scheme allows the follower to have an orientation\nmismatch relative to the leader to execute anticipatory reconfiguration by\ntransitioning between the relative positions in the admissible formation set\nwhen the leader aggressively maneuvers.

If a\nCT scanner introduces a new artifact not present in the training labels, the\nmodel may misclassify the images. Although modern CT scanners include design\nfeatures which mitigate these artifacts, unanticipated or difficult-to-mitigate\nartifacts can still appear in practice. The direct solution of labeling images\nfrom this new distribution can be costly. As a more accessible alternative,\nthis study evaluates domain adaptation as an approach for training models that\nmaintain classification performance despite new artifacts, even without\ncorresponding labels. We simulate ring artifacts from detector gain error in\nsinogram space and evaluate domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) against\nbaseline and augmentation-based approaches on the OrganAMNIST abdominal CT\ndataset. Our results demonstrate that baseline models trained only on clean\nimages fail to generalize to images with ring artifacts, and traditional\naugmentation with other distortion types provides no improvement on unseen\nartifact domains. In contrast, the DANN approach successfully maintains high\nclassification accuracy on ring artifact images using only unlabeled artifact\ndata during training, demonstrating the viability of domain adaptation for\nartifact robustness. The domain-adapted model achieved classification\nperformance on ring artifact test data comparable to models explicitly trained\nwith labeled artifact images, while also showing unexpected generalization to\nuniform noise.

Inspired by recent works in Deep Multiple Instance Learning\n(DMIL), we propose a method that trains pixel-level multi-class classifiers and\npredicts low-resolution labels (i.e., patch-level classification), where the\nactual high-resolution labels are learned implicitly without direct\nsupervision. This is achieved with flexible pooling layers that are able to\nlink the semantics of the pixels in the high-resolution imagery to the\nlow-resolution reference labels. Then, the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)\nproblem is re-framed in a multi-class and in a multi-label setting. In the\nformer, the low-resolution annotation represents the majority of the pixels in\nthe patch. In the latter, the annotation only provides us information on the\npresence of one of the land-cover classes in the patch and thus multiple labels\ncan be considered valid for a patch at a time, whereas the low-resolution\nlabels provide us only one label. Therefore, the classifier is trained with a\nPositive-Unlabeled Learning (PUL) strategy.

For example, increasing\nemphasis on defensive specifications via prompting lowers the success rate of\ngradient-based multimodal attacks on VLMs robustified by adversarial\npretraining, but this same intervention provides no such benefit to\nnot-robustified models.

We introduce TransFIRA (Transfer\nLearning for Face Image Recognizability Assessment), a lightweight and\nannotation-free framework that grounds recognizability directly in embedding\nspace. TransFIRA delivers three advances: (i) a definition of recognizability\nvia class-center similarity (CCS) and class-center angular separation (CCAS),\nyielding the first natural, decision-boundary--aligned criterion for filtering\nand weighting; (ii) a recognizability-informed aggregation strategy that\nachieves state-of-the-art verification accuracy on BRIAR and IJB-C while nearly\ndoubling correlation with true recognizability, all without external labels,\nheuristics, or backbone-specific training; and (iii) new extensions beyond\nfaces, including encoder-grounded explainability that reveals how degradations\nand subject-specific factors affect recognizability, and the first\nrecognizability-aware body recognition assessment. Experiments confirm\nstate-of-the-art results on faces, strong performance on body recognition, and\nrobustness under cross-dataset shifts.

Recently, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has\nsimplified this paradigm by replacing the reward and value models with\nrule-based verifiers. A prominent example is Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO). However, GRPO inherently suffers from a length bias, since the same\nadvantage is uniformly assigned to all tokens of a response. As a result,\nlonger responses distribute the reward over more tokens and thus contribute\ndisproportionately to gradient updates. Several variants, such as DAPO and Dr.\nGRPO, modify the token-level aggregation of the loss, yet these methods remain\nheuristic and offer limited interpretability regarding their implicit token\npreferences. In this work, we explore the possibility of allowing the model to\nlearn its own token preference during optimization.

Consequently, thinking after\nreceiving the full input is not suitable for speech-to-speech interaction,\nwhere real-time, low-latency exchange is important. We address this by noting\nthat humans naturally \"think while listening.\" In this paper, we propose\nSHANKS, a general inference framework that enables SLMs to generate unspoken\nchain-of-thought reasoning while listening to the user input. SHANKS streams\nthe input speech in fixed-duration chunks and, as soon as a chunk is received,\ngenerates unspoken reasoning based on all previous speech and reasoning, while\nthe user continues speaking. SHANKS uses this unspoken reasoning to decide\nwhether to interrupt the user and to make tool calls to complete the task. We\ndemonstrate that SHANKS enhances real-time user-SLM interaction in two\nscenarios: (1) when the user is presenting a step-by-step solution to a math\nproblem, SHANKS can listen, reason, and interrupt when the user makes a\nmistake, achieving 37.1% higher interruption accuracy than a baseline that\ninterrupts without thinking; and (2) in a tool-augmented dialogue, SHANKS can\ncomplete 56.9% of the tool calls before the user finishes their turn.

While many studies have demonstrated\nperformance benefits of combining multiple model predictions, existing\nstrategies using linear pooling methods (ranging from simple averaging to\ndynamic weight updates) face a key limitation. Dynamic prediction combinations\nthat rely on historical performance to update weights are necessarily reactive.\nDue to the need to average over a reasonable number of epochs (with moving\naverages or exponential weighting), they tend to be slow to adjust to changing\ncircumstances (phase or regime changes). In this work, we develop a model that\nuses machine learning to forecast the performance of predictions by models at\neach epoch in a time series. This enables `context-awareness' by assigning\nhigher weight to models that are likely to be more accurate at a given time. We\nshow that adding a performance forecasting worker in a decentralized learning\nnetwork, following a design similar to the Allora network, can improve the\naccuracy of network inferences. Specifically, we find forecasting models that\npredict regret (performance relative to the network inference) or regret\nz-score (performance relative to other workers) show greater improvement than\nmodels predicting losses, which often do not outperform the naive network\ninference (historically weighted average of all inferences). Through a series\nof optimization tests, we show that the performance of the forecasting model\ncan be sensitive to choices in the feature set and number of training epochs.\nThese properties may depend on the exact problem and should be tailored to each\ndomain. Although initially designed for a decentralized learning network, using\nperformance forecasting for prediction combination may be useful in any\nsituation where predictive rather than reactive model weighting is needed."}

Our results show LLMs overall struggle on\nthe target structures, but especially on garden path (GP) sentences. Indeed,\nwhile the strongest models achieve near perfect accuracy on non-GP structures\n(93.7% for GPT-5), they struggle on GP structures (46.8% for GPT-5).\nAdditionally, when ranking structures based on average performance, rank\ncorrelation between humans and models increases with parameter count. For each\ntarget structure, we also collect data for their matched baseline without the\ndifficult structure.

The core\nidea of HSNet is to decompose the global graph into manageable sub-components.\nFirst, we introduce the Constructive Subgraph Set Block (CSSB), which generates\na diverse set of complementary subgraphs. Rather than relying on a single\nmonolithic graph, CSSB captures heterogeneous characteristics of the image by\nmodeling different relational patterns and feature interactions, producing a\nrich ensemble of both local and global graph structures. Subsequently, the\nSubgraph Aggregation Block (SAB) integrates the representations embedded across\nthese subgraphs. Through adaptive weighting and fusion of multi-graph features,\nSAB constructs a comprehensive and discriminative representation that captures\nintricate interdependencies. Furthermore, a Node Sampling Strategy (NSS) is\ndesigned to selectively retain the most salient features, thereby enhancing\naccuracy while reducing computational overhead.

In this work, we establish non-asymptotic bounds\non the deviation of the prediction set length from the oracle interval length\nfor conformalized quantile and median regression trained via SGD, under mild\nassumptions on the data distribution. Our bounds of order\n$\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{n} + 1/(\\alpha^2 n) + 1/\\sqrt{m} + \\exp(-\\alpha^2 m))$\ncapture the joint dependence of efficiency on the proper training set size $n$,\nthe calibration set size $m$, and the miscoverage level $\\alpha$. The results\nidentify phase transitions in convergence rates across different regimes of\n$\\alpha$, offering guidance for allocating data to control excess prediction\nset length. Empirical results are consistent with our theoretical findings."}

We decouple multi-resolution\ninference into two key behaviors: 1) extrapolation to varying frequency\ninformation; and 2) interpolating across varying resolutions. We empirically\ndemonstrate that MLOs fail to do both of these tasks in a zero-shot manner.\nConsequently, we find MLOs are not able to perform accurate inference at\nresolutions different from those on which they were trained, and instead they\nare brittle and susceptible to aliasing. To address these failure modes, we\npropose a simple, computationally-efficient, and data-driven multi-resolution\ntraining protocol that overcomes aliasing and that provides robust\nmulti-resolution generalization."}

Yet, in stark contrast to most other families of bandit\nalgorithms, the exact mechanism through which posterior sampling (as introduced\nby Thompson) is able to \"properly\" balance exploration and exploitation,\nremains a mystery. In this paper we show that the core insight to address this\nquestion stems from recasting Thompson Sampling as an online optimization\nalgorithm. To distill this, a key conceptual tool is introduced, which we refer\nto as \"faithful\" stationarization of the regret formulation. Essentially, the\nfinite horizon dynamic optimization problem is converted into a stationary\ncounterpart which \"closely resembles\" the original objective (in contrast, the\nclassical infinite horizon discounted formulation, that leads to the Gittins\nindex, alters the problem and objective in too significant a manner). The newly\ncrafted time invariant objective can be studied using Bellman's principle which\nleads to a time invariant optimal policy. When viewed through this lens,\nThompson Sampling admits a simple online optimization form that mimics the\nstructure of the Bellman-optimal policy, and where greediness is regularized by\na measure of residual uncertainty based on point-biserial correlation. This\nanswers the question of how Thompson Sampling balances\nexploration-exploitation, and moreover, provides a principled framework to\nstudy and further improve Thompson's original idea."}

The framework integrates four components: (I)\nQI-Safe-10K, a curated dataset emphasizing safety-critical and\nreasoning-sensitive cases; (II) safety-aware rollout, where unsafe generations\nundergo reflection and correction instead of being discarded; (III) structured\nreward modeling with multi-dimensional weighted criteria and explicit penalties\nfor hallucinations and contradictions; and (IV) GRPO optimization, which\nreinforces both safe and corrected trajectories. This unified design shifts\nsafety from a passive safeguard to an active driver of reasoning, enabling\nscalable and generalizable safety-aware reasoning. SaFeR-VLM further\ndemonstrates robustness against both explicit and implicit risks, supporting\ndynamic and interpretable safety decisions beyond surface-level filtering.\nSaFeR-VLM-3B achieves average performance $70.13$ and $78.97$ on safety and\nhelpfulness across six benchmarks, surpassing both same-scale and $>10\\times$\nlarger models such as Skywork-R1V3-38B, Qwen2.5VL-72B, and GLM4.5V-106B.\nRemarkably, SaFeR-VLM-7B benefits from its increased scale to surpass\nGPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash by \\num{6.47} and \\num{16.76} points\nrespectively on safety metrics, achieving this improvement without any\ndegradation in helpfulness performance.

This\npaper introduces a novel deep learning framework, named Gated Temporal\nConvolutional Network and Graph (GTCN-G), engineered to overcome these\nlimitations. Our model uniquely fuses a Gated TCN (G-TCN) for extracting\nhierarchical temporal features from network flows with a Graph Convolutional\nNetwork (GCN) designed to learn from the underlying graph structure. The core\ninnovation lies in the integration of a residual learning mechanism,\nimplemented via a Graph Attention Network (GAT). This mechanism preserves\noriginal feature information through residual connections, which is critical\nfor mitigating the class imbalance problem and enhancing detection sensitivity\nfor rare malicious activities (minority classes).

We introduce\nOnline Rubrics Elicitation (OnlineRubrics), a method that dynamically curates\nevaluation criteria in an online manner through pairwise comparisons of\nresponses from current and reference policies. This online process enables\ncontinuous identification and mitigation of errors as training proceeds.\nEmpirically, this approach yields consistent improvements of up to 8% over\ntraining exclusively with static rubrics across AlpacaEval, GPQA, ArenaHard as\nwell as the validation sets of expert questions and rubrics.

A bank failure can destroy the stability of the financial\nsystem, as banks are subject to systemic risk, affecting not only individual\nbanks but also segments or the entire financial system. Calculating the\nprobability of a bank going bankrupt is one way to ensure the banking system is\nsafe and sound. Existing literature and limitations: Statistical models, such\nas Altman's Z-Score, are one of the common techniques for developing a\nbankruptcy prediction model. However, statistical methods rely on rigid and\nsometimes irrelevant assumptions, which can result in low forecast accuracy.\nNew approaches are necessary. Objective of the research: Bankruptcy models are\ndeveloped using machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression (LR),\nrandom forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVM). According to several\nstudies, machine learning is also more accurate and effective than statistical\nmethods for categorising and forecasting banking risk management. Present\nResearch: The commercial bank data are derived from the annual financial\nstatements of 44 active banks and 21 bankrupt banks in Turkey from 1994 to\n2004, and the rural bank data are derived from the quarterly financial reports\nof 43 active and 43 bankrupt rural banks in Indonesia between 2013 and 2019.\nFive rural banks in Indonesia have also been selected to demonstrate the\nfeasibility of analysing bank bankruptcy trends. Findings and implications: The\nresults of the research experiments show that RF can forecast data from\ncommercial banks with a 90% accuracy rate. Furthermore, the three machine\nlearning methods proposed accurately predict the likelihood of rural bank\nbankruptcy.

We revisit the environment\nitself. We propose Markovian Thinking, a paradigm in which the policy advances\nreasoning while conditioning on a constant-size state, decoupling thinking\nlength from context size. As an immediate consequence this yields linear\ncompute with constant memory. We instantiate this idea with Delethink, an RL\nenvironment that structures reasoning into fixed-size chunks.

A model exhibits Complexity OoD\ngeneralization when it maintains performance on test instances whose minimal\nrequired solution complexity, either representational (richer solution\nstructure) or computational (more reasoning steps/program length), exceeds that\nof all training examples. We formalize complexity via solution description\nKolmogorov complexity and operational proxies (e.g., object/relation counts;\nreasoning step counts), clarifying how Complexity OoD differs from length and\ncompositional OoD. This lens unifies learning and reasoning: many cases\nsolvable with System1 like processing at low complexity become System2 like\nunder complexity pressure, while System2 can be viewed as generalization over\nsolution structures.

In this paper, we propose a\nreasoning-driven LLM-based pipeline to study effective reasoning behavior\npatterns in agentic search. Using this pipeline, we analyze successful agentic\nsearch trajectories and identify four beneficial reasoning behaviors:\nInformation Verification, Authority Evaluation, Adaptive Search, and Error\nRecovery. Based on these findings, we propose a technique called Behavior\nPriming to train more effective agentic search models. It synthesizes agentic\nsearch trajectories that exhibit these four behaviors and integrates them into\nthe agentic search model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by\nstandard reinforcement learning (RL). Experiments on three benchmarks (GAIA,\nWebWalker, and HLE) demonstrate that behavior priming yields over 35% gains in\nLlama3.2-3B and Qwen3-1.7B compared to directly training agentic search models\nwith RL.

We find that the designed agents have low behavioral\ndiversity, limiting the potential for their complementary use. Third, we assess\nwhen automated design is economically viable. We find that only in a few\ncases--specifically, two datasets--the overall cost of designing and deploying\nthe agents is lower than that of human-designed agents when deployed on over\n15,000 examples. In contrast, the performance gains for other datasets do not\njustify the design cost, regardless of scale."}

We present\nSearch-R3, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by adapting LLMs to\ngenerate search embeddings as a direct output of their reasoning process. Our\napproach exploits LLMs' chain-of-thought capabilities, allowing them to produce\nmore effective embeddings by reasoning step-by-step through complex semantic\nanalyses. We implement this through three complementary mechanisms. (1) a\nsupervised learning stage enables the model's ability to produce quality\nembeddings, (2) a reinforcement learning (RL) methodology that optimizes\nembedding generation alongside reasoning, and (3) a specialized RL environment\nthat efficiently handles evolving embedding representations without requiring\ncomplete corpus re-encoding at each training iteration.

Recent\nadvances have enabled language-guided tracking in complex and unstructured\nscenes. However, existing approaches lack explicit spatial reasoning and\neffective temporal memory, causing failures under severe occlusions or in the\npresence of similar-looking distractors. To address these challenges, we\npresent TrackVLA++, a novel Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that enhances\nembodied visual tracking with two key modules, a spatial reasoning mechanism\nand a Target Identification Memory (TIM). The reasoning module introduces a\nChain-of-Thought paradigm, termed Polar-CoT, which infers the target's relative\nposition and encodes it as a compact polar-coordinate token for action\nprediction. Guided by these spatial priors, the TIM employs a gated update\nstrategy to preserve long-horizon target memory, ensuring spatiotemporal\nconsistency and mitigating target loss during extended occlusions. Extensive\nexperiments show that TrackVLA++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on\npublic benchmarks across both egocentric and multi-camera settings.

To address these limitations, we propose stateful\nmulti-agent evolutionary search, a training-free framework that departs from\nprior stateless approaches by combining (i) persistent inference-time state,\n(ii) adversarial mutation, and (iii) evolutionary preservation.

Understanding the role of the\nconditions of life in this disparity can aid in developing more robust,\nadaptive, and caring artificial agents.

To\nvalidate this framework, we instantiate AHNs using modern RNN-like\narchitectures, including Mamba2, DeltaNet, and Gated DeltaNet. Extensive\nexperiments on long-context benchmarks LV-Eval and InfiniteBench demonstrate\nthat AHN-augmented models consistently outperform sliding window baselines and\nachieve performance comparable or even superior to full-attention models, while\nsubstantially reducing computational and memory requirements. For instance,\naugmenting the Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct with AHNs reduces inference FLOPs by 40.5%\nand memory cache by 74.0%, while improving its average score on LV-Eval (128k\nsequence length) from 4.41 to 5.88.
