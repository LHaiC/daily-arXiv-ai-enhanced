We introduce DINO-YOLO, a hybrid\narchitecture combining YOLOv12 with DINOv3 self-supervised vision transformers\nfor data-efficient detection. DINOv3 features are strategically integrated at\ntwo locations: input preprocessing (P0) and mid-backbone enhancement (P3).\nExperimental validation demonstrates substantial improvements: Tunnel Segment\nCrack detection (648 images) achieves 12.4% improvement, Construction PPE (1K\nimages) gains 13.7%, and KITTI (7K images) shows 88.6% improvement, while\nmaintaining real-time inference (30-47 FPS). Systematic ablation across five\nYOLO scales and nine DINOv3 variants reveals that Medium-scale architectures\nachieve optimal performance with DualP0P3 integration (55.77% mAP@0.5), while\nSmall-scale requires Triple Integration (53.63%). The 2-4x inference overhead\n(21-33ms versus 8-16ms baseline) remains acceptable for field deployment on\nNVIDIA RTX 5090. DINO-YOLO establishes state-of-the-art performance for civil\nengineering datasets (<10K images) while preserving computational efficiency,\nproviding practical solutions for construction safety monitoring and\ninfrastructure inspection in data-constrained environments."}

Malnou"], "title": "Artificial Transmission Line Synthesis Tailored for Traveling-Wave Parametric Processes", "comment": "25 pages, 10 figures", "summary": "Artificial transmission lines built with lumped-element inductors and\ncapacitors form the backbone of broadband, nearly quantum-limited\ntraveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs). However, systematic design\nmethods for TWPAs, and more generally artificial transmission lines, are\nlacking. Here, I develop a general synthesis framework for lossless artificial\ntransmission lines by borrowing from periodic structure theory and passive\nnetwork synthesis. These complementary approaches divide the design space:\nperiodic loading synthesis employs spatial modulation of frequency-independent\ncomponents, while filter synthesis employs frequency-dependent responses in\nspatially-uniform components. When tailoring transmission lines for parametric\nprocesses, nonlinear elements are added, typically nonlinear inductances in\nsuperconducting circuits, while ensuring energy and momentum conservation\nbetween interacting tones. Applying this framework, I design a kinetic\ninductance TWPA with a novel phase-matching architecture, and a backward-pumped\nJosephson TWPA exploiting an ambidextrous i.e., right-left-handed transmission\nline."}
