In practice, they create a novel mode of\nperception shaped by sparse, distorted, and unstable input. They resemble early\nextended reality (XR) headsets more than natural vision, streaming video from a\nhead-mounted camera to a neural \"display\" with under 1000 pixels, limited field\nof view, low refresh rates, and nonlinear spatial mappings. No amount of\nresolution alone will make this experience natural. This paper proposes a\nreframing: bionic vision as neuroadaptive XR. Rather than replicating natural\nsight, the goal is to co-adapt brain and device through a bidirectional\ninterface that responds to neural constraints, behavioral goals, and cognitive\nstate. By comparing traditional XR, current implants, and proposed\nneuroadaptive systems, it introduces a new design space for inclusive,\nbrain-aware computing. It concludes with research provocations spanning\nencoding, evaluation, learning, and ethics, and invites the XR community to\nhelp shape the future of sensory augmentation."}

In addition to maintaining acceptable collision\nrisks, this approach seeks to minimize the average fuel consumption of CAMs by\nmaking early maneuver decisions. We model CAM as a continuous state, discrete\naction and finite horizon MDP, where the critical decision is determining when\nto initiate the maneuver. The MDP model also incorporates analytical models for\nconjunction risk, propellant consumption, and transit orbit geometry. The\nMarkov policy effectively trades-off maneuver delay-which improves the\nreliability of conjunction risk indicators-with propellant consumption-which\nincreases with decreasing maneuver time. Using historical data of tracked\nconjunction events, we verify this framework and conduct an extensive ablation\nstudy on the hyper-parameters used within the MDP. On synthetic conjunction\nevents, the trained policy significantly minimizes both the overall and average\npropellant consumption per CAM when compared to a conventional cut-off policy\nthat initiates maneuvers 24 hours before the time of closest approach (TCA). On\nhistorical conjunction events, the trained policy consumes more propellant\noverall but reduces the average propellant consumption per CAM.

However, the prior arts overlook\nthe influence of perturbation directions, resulting in limited transferability.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel attack method, named Residual Perturbation\nAttack (ResPA), relying on the residual gradient as the perturbation direction\nto guide the adversarial examples toward the flat regions of the loss function.\nSpecifically, ResPA conducts an exponential moving average on the input\ngradients to obtain the first moment as the reference gradient, which\nencompasses the direction of historical gradients. Instead of heavily relying\non the local flatness that stems from the current gradients as the perturbation\ndirection, ResPA further considers the residual between the current gradient\nand the reference gradient to capture the changes in the global perturbation\ndirection.

In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework for\nanalyzing linear encoder-decoder architectures through the lens of Bayes risk\nminimization for solving data-driven scientific machine learning problems. We\nderive closed-form, rank-constrained linear and affine linear optimal mappings\nfor forward modeling and inverse recovery tasks. Our results generalize\nexisting formulations by accommodating rank-deficiencies in data, forward\noperators, and measurement processes. We validate our theoretical results by\nconducting numerical experiments on datasets from simple biomedical imaging,\nfinancial factor analysis, and simulations involving nonlinear fluid dynamics\nvia the shallow water equations. This work provides a robust baseline for\nunderstanding and benchmarking learned neural network models for scientific\nmachine learning problems."}

In this paper, we introduce HOLODECK 2.0, an advanced\nvision-language-guided framework for 3D world generation with support for\ninteractive scene editing based on human feedback. HOLODECK 2.0 can generate\ndiverse and stylistically rich 3D scenes (e.g., realistic, cartoon, anime, and\ncyberpunk styles) that exhibit high semantic fidelity to fine-grained input\ndescriptions, suitable for both indoor and open-domain environments. HOLODECK\n2.0 leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to identify and parse the objects\nrequired in a scene and generates corresponding high-quality assets via\nstate-of-the-art 3D generative models. It then iteratively applies spatial\nconstraints derived from the VLMs to achieve semantically coherent and\nphysically plausible layouts. Human evaluations and CLIP-based assessments\ndemonstrate that HOLODECK 2.0 effectively generates high-quality scenes closely\naligned with detailed textual descriptions, consistently outperforming\nbaselines across indoor and open-domain scenarios.

Crucially, this result eliminates the dependency on $\\log T$ and\nmatches the established $\\Omega\\big( \\sqrt{kmT}\\big)$ lower bound up to\n$O\\big((\\log k)^2\\big)$. We then extend our analysis to show that CMOSS is also\napplicable to cascading feedback. Experiments on synthetic and real-world\ndatasets validate that CMOSS consistently outperforms benchmark algorithms in\nboth regret and runtime efficiency."}

Spectrum\nintroduces a novel repurposing of an Image-to-Texture (I2Tx) diffusion model --\nobtained by fine-tuning a T2I model on 3D human texture maps -- for improved\nalignment with body parts and clothing. From an input image, we extract\nhuman-part internal features via the I2Tx diffusion model and generate\nsemantically valid masks aligned to diverse clothing categories through\nprompt-guided grounding. Once trained, Spectrum produces semantic segmentation\nmaps for every visible body part and clothing category, ignoring standalone\ngarments or irrelevant objects, for any number of humans in the scene.

The key treatment involves reshaping the string vector into\nmatrix form and applying orthogonal transformations to its columns and rows in\na cross manner, thereby increasing the reconciliation dimension by one order\nper cross-rotation while significantly reducing the communication overhead over\nthe classical channel. A rigorous performance analysis is also presented from\nthe perspective of achievable sum-rate.

This soft handling of uncertainty is tightly coupled\nwith hard enforcement of physical feasibility: we embed operational\nconstraints, such as transformer capacity limits and radial topology\nrequirements, directly into the learning process. Together, these components\nensure that inference is both uncertainty-aware and structurally valid,\nenabling rapid convergence to actionable, trustworthy topologies under\nreal-world deployment conditions. The proposed framework is validated using\ndata from over 8000 meters across 3 feeders in Oncor's service territory,\ndemonstrating over 95% accuracy in topology reconstruction and substantial\nimprovements in confidence calibration and computational efficiency relative to\nbaseline methods."}

However, its effectiveness relies on robust identity\nauthentication, as vulnerabilities in the authentication process can cause a\ncompromise with the security of the entire communication system. Over the past\nthree decades, numerous quantum identity authentication (QIA) protocols have\nbeen proposed. This thesis first presents a chronological review of these\nprotocols, categorizing them based on quantum resources and computational tasks\ninvolved while analyzing their strengths and limitations. Subsequently, by\nrecognizing inherent symmetries present in the existing protocols, we design\nnovel QIA schemes based on secure computational and communication tasks.\nSpecifically, this work introduces a set of new QIA protocols that utilize\ncontrolled secure direct quantum communication. The proposed scheme facilitates\nmutual authentication between two users, Alice and Bob, with assistance from a\nthird party, Charlie, using Bell states. A comprehensive security analysis\ndemonstrates its robustness against impersonation, intercept-resend, and\nfraudulent authentication attacks. The comparative evaluation highlights its\nadvantages over existing schemes. Additionally, this thesis presents two novel\nQKD protocols that eliminate the need for entanglement or ideal single-photon\nsources, making them feasible with commercially available photon sources. These\nprotocols are rigorously proven to be secure against various attacks, including\nintercept-resend and certain collective attacks.

A key algorithmic tool in neuromorphic\ncomputing is spiking neural networks (SNNs).

Similar to SNNs,\ndeep state-space models (SSMs) utilize stateful building blocks. However, deep\nSSMs, which recently achieved competitive performance in various temporal\nmodeling tasks, are typically designed with high-precision activation functions\nand no reset mechanisms. To bridge the gains offered by SNNs and the recent\ndeep SSM models, we propose a novel multiple-output spiking neuron model that\ncombines a linear, general SSM state transition with a non-linear feedback\nmechanism through reset. Compared to the existing neuron models for SNNs, our\nproposed model clearly conceptualizes the differences between the spiking\nfunction, the reset condition and the reset action.

These two tasks exhibit strong contradictory\nattributes.

We propose SCJoint, a joint learning scheme for SOD and COD tasks,\nassuming that the decoding processes of SOD and COD have different distribution\ncharacteristics. The key to our method is to learn the respective means and\nvariances of the decoding processes for both tasks by inserting a minimal\namount of task-specific learnable parameters within a fully shared network\nstructure, thereby decoupling the contradictory attributes of the two tasks at\na minimal cost.

We propose\na pipeline that generates super-resolved, patient-specific 3D pseudo-healthy\ntarget morphologies from conventional clinical MR scans. First, we compute an\nisotropic super-resolved MR volume using an Implicit Neural Representation\n(INR). Next, we segment femur, tibia, patella, and fibula with a multi-label\ncustom-trained network. Finally, we train a Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM) to\ngenerate pseudo-healthy target morphologies of the trochlear region. In\ncontrast to prior work producing pseudo-healthy low-resolution 3D MR images,\nour approach enables the generation of sub-millimeter resolved 3D shapes\ncompatible for pre- and intraoperative use. These can serve as preoperative\nblueprints for reshaping the femoral groove while preserving the native patella\narticulation.

Recent diffusion-based methods have\ndemonstrated significant potential in 2D-to-3D implicit mapping, they rely on\ndata-driven statistical priors and miss the explicit modeling of light-surface\ninteraction, leading to multi-view normal direction conflicts. Moreover, the\ndiscrete sampling mechanism of diffusion models causes gradient discontinuity\nin differentiable rendering reconstruction modules, preventing 3D geometric\nerrors from being backpropagated to the normal generation network, thereby\nforcing existing methods to depend on dense normal annotations. This paper\nproposes SINGAD, a novel Self-supervised framework from a single Image for\nNormal estimation via 3D GAussian splatting guided Diffusion. By integrating\nphysics-driven light-interaction modeling and a differentiable rendering-based\nreprojection strategy, our framework directly converts 3D geometric errors into\nnormal optimization signals, solving the challenges of multi-view geometric\ninconsistency and data dependency. Specifically, the framework constructs a\nlight-interaction-driven 3DGS reparameterization model to generate multi-scale\ngeometric features consistent with light transport principles, ensuring\nmulti-view normal consistency. A cross-domain feature fusion module is designed\nwithin a conditional diffusion model, embedding geometric priors to constrain\nnormal generation while maintaining accurate geometric error propagation.\nFurthermore, a differentiable 3D reprojection loss strategy is introduced for\nself-supervised optimization that minimizes geometric error between the\nreconstructed and input image, eliminating dependence on annotated normal\ndatasets.

Current mainstream VQA methods typically improve\nperformance by pretraining on large-scale classification datasets (e.g.,\nImageNet, Kinetics-400), followed by fine-tuning on VQA datasets. However, this\nstrategy presents two significant challenges: (1) merely transferring semantic\nknowledge learned from pretraining is insufficient for VQA, as video quality\ndepends on multiple factors (e.g., semantics, distortion, motion, aesthetics);\n(2) pretraining on large-scale datasets demands enormous computational\nresources, often dozens or even hundreds of times greater than training\ndirectly on VQA datasets. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown\nremarkable generalization capabilities across a wide range of visual tasks, and\nhave begun to demonstrate promising potential in quality assessment. In this\nwork, we propose Q-CLIP, the first fully VLMs-based framework for VQA.

Our\nsystematic evaluation of six state-of-the-art UMLFFs reveals a substantial\nreality gap: models achieving impressive performance on computational\nbenchmarks often fail when confronted with experimental complexity. Even the\nbest-performing models exhibit higher density prediction error than the\nthreshold required for practical applications. Most strikingly, we observe\ndisconnects between simulation stability and mechanical property accuracy, with\nprediction errors correlating with training data representation rather than the\nmodeling method.

We identify shortcut learning -- the\nreliance on task-irrelevant features -- as a key impediment to generalization.\nThrough comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis, we uncover two\nprimary contributors to shortcut learning: (1) limited diversity within\nindividual sub-datasets, and (2) significant distributional disparities across\nsub-datasets, leading to dataset fragmentation. These issues arise from the\ninherent structure of large-scale datasets like OXE, which are typically\ncomposed of multiple sub-datasets collected independently across varied\nenvironments and embodiments.

However, existing\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially open-source ones, are\nstill falling behind with a typical success rate of 30%-50% on challenging\nbenchmarks. Previous studies on fine-tuning MLLMs with synthetic charts are\noften restricted by their inadequate similarity to the real charts, which could\ncompromise model training and performance on complex real-world charts. In this\nstudy, we show that modularizing chart generation and diversifying visual\ndetails improves chart understanding capabilities. In particular, we design a\nfive-step data synthesis pipeline, where we separate data and function creation\nfor single plot generation, condition the generation of later subplots on\nearlier ones for multi-subplot figures, visually diversify the generated\nfigures, filter out low quality data, and finally generate the question-answer\n(QA) pairs with GPT-4o. This approach allows us to streamline the generation of\nfine-tuning datasets and introduce the effective chart dataset (ECD), which\ncontains 10k+ chart images and 300k+ QA pairs, covering 25 topics and featuring\n250+ chart type combinations with high visual complexity.

In this paper, we propose Lightswitch, a novel finetuned\nmaterial-relighting diffusion framework that efficiently relights an arbitrary\nnumber of input images to a target lighting condition while incorporating cues\nfrom inferred intrinsic properties. By using multi-view and material\ninformation cues together with a scalable denoising scheme, our method\nconsistently and efficiently relights dense multi-view data of objects with\ndiverse material compositions. We show that our 2D relighting prediction\nquality exceeds previous state-of-the-art relighting priors that directly\nrelight from images.

KnapFormer builds on the insight that strong\nsynergy exists between sequence parallelism and the need to address the\nsignificant token imbalance across ranks. This imbalance arises from\nvariable-length text inputs and varying visual token counts in mixed-resolution\nand image-video joint training. KnapFormer redistributes tokens by first\ngathering sequence length metadata across all ranks in a balancing group and\nsolving a global knapsack problem. The solver aims to minimize the variances of\ntotal workload per-GPU, while accounting for the effect of sequence\nparallelism. By integrating DeepSpeed-Ulysees-based sequence parallelism in the\nload-balancing decision process and utilizing a simple semi-empirical workload\nmodel, KnapFormers achieves minimal communication overhead and less than 1%\nworkload discrepancy in real-world training workloads with sequence length\nvarying from a few hundred to tens of thousands.

We identify shortcut learning -- the\nreliance on task-irrelevant features -- as a key impediment to generalization.\nThrough comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis, we uncover two\nprimary contributors to shortcut learning: (1) limited diversity within\nindividual sub-datasets, and (2) significant distributional disparities across\nsub-datasets, leading to dataset fragmentation. These issues arise from the\ninherent structure of large-scale datasets like OXE, which are typically\ncomposed of multiple sub-datasets collected independently across varied\nenvironments and embodiments. Our findings provide critical insights into\ndataset collection strategies that can reduce shortcut learning and enhance the\ngeneralization ability of generalist robot policies.
