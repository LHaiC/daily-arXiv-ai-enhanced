Fog\ncomputing has emerged as a solution for processing these IoT applications, but\nit faces challenges such as resource allocation and job scheduling. Therefore,\nit is crucial to determine how to assign and schedule tasks on Fog nodes. A\nwell-designed job scheduling algorithm can help decrease energy usage and\nimprove response times for application requests. This work aims to schedule\ntasks in IoT while minimizing the total energy consumption of nodes and\nenhancing the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of IoT tasks, taking into\naccount task deadlines. Initially, this paper classifies the Fog nodes into two\ncategories based on their traffic level: low and high. It schedules\nlow-deadline tasks on low-traffic-level nodes using an Improved Golden Eagle\nOptimization (IGEO) algorithm, an enhancement of the Golden Eagle Optimization\nAlgorithm that utilizes genetic operators for discretization. High-deadline\ntasks are processed on high-traffic nodes using reinforcement learning (RL).\nThis combined approach is called the Reinforcement Improved Golden Eagle\nOptimization (RIGEO) algorithm.

Then, within this framework, we analyze three market\nmechanisms: (a) a single-product real-time energy market, (b) a\nproduct-differentiated real-time energy market that treats solar energy and\ngrid energy as different products, and (c) a contract-based panel market that\ntrades claims or rights to the production of certain panel capacity ex-ante,\nrather than the realized solar production ex-post.

Different from the existing methods, we present an edge-based search\nscheme to find clipping planes (bisectors). A test called point-in-cell is\nfirst set up to tell whether a space point is in a target Voronoi cell or not.\nThen, for each edge of the intermediate domain-cell intersection, we will\nlaunch a clipping only if its two endpoints are respectively inside and outside\nthe corresponding Voronoi cell, where the bisector for the clipping can be\nfound by using a few times of point-in-cell tests. Therefore, our method only\ninvolves the clippings that contribute to the final results, which is a great\nadvantage over the state-of-the-art methods.

To capture\nfine-grained texture, each motion Gaussian anchors and dynamically activates a\nset of local appearance Gaussians, which are non-rigidly warped to the current\nframe to provide strong initialization and significantly reduce training time.\nThis activation mechanism enables efficient modeling of detailed textures and\nmaintains temporal coherence, allowing high-fidelity rendering even under\nchallenging scenarios such as changing clothes. To enable seamless integration\ninto codec-based volumetric formats, we introduce a global Gaussian Lookup\nTable that records the lifespan of each Gaussian and organizes attributes into\na lifespan-aware 2D layout.

Our approach includes:\n(a) a dependency flagging system during endorsement, marking transactions as\nindependent or dependent using a hashmap; (b) an optimized block construction\nin the ordering service that prioritizes independent transactions; (c) the\nincorporation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) within each block to represent\ndependencies; and (d) parallel execution of independent transactions at the\ncommitter, with dependent transactions processed according to DAG order.\nIncorporated in Hyperledger Fabric v2.5, our framework was tested on workloads\nwith varying dependency levels and system loads. Results show up to 40% higher\nthroughput and significantly reduced rejection rates in high-contention\nscenarios. This demonstrates that dependency-aware scheduling and DAG-based\nexecution can substantially enhance Fabric's scalability while remaining\ncompatible with its existing consensus and smart contract layers."}

We propose a\ndata-knowledge fusion framework to achieve intelligent FSA in actual power\ngrids. First, we classify FSA domain knowledge into two distinct categories:\n(1) physics-guided knowledge directs the neural network pre-training process,\nensuring that the fusion model's predictions consistent with frequency response\nmechanisms, and (2) physics-constrained knowledge establishes quantitative\nrelationship on predictions, which forces them within theoretical ranges\ndefined by domain knowledge.

Thus, if\nfault-tolerant quantum computers could efficiently solve such nonlinear\nproblems, it would be a transformative change for many industries. In a recent\nbreakthrough [Liu et al., PNAS 2021], the first efficient quantum algorithm for\nsolving nonlinear differential equations was constructed, based on a single\ncondition $R<1$, where $R$ characterizes the ratio of nonlinearity to\ndissipation. This result, however, is limited to the class of purely\ndissipative systems with negative log-norm, which excludes application to many\nimportant problems. In this work, we correct technical issues with this and\nother prior analysis, and substantially extend the scope of nonlinear dynamical\nsystems that can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer in a number of\nways. Firstly, we extend the existing results from purely dissipative systems\nto a much broader class of stable systems, and show that every quadratic\nLyapunov function for the linearized system corresponds to an independent\n$R$-number criterion for the convergence of the Carlemen scheme. Secondly, we\nextend our stable system results to physically relevant settings where\nconserved polynomial quantities exist. Finally, we provide extensive results\nfor the class of non-resonant systems. With this, we are able to show that\nefficient quantum algorithms exist for a much wider class of nonlinear systems\nthan previously known, and prove the BQP-completeness of nonlinear oscillator\nproblems of exponential size. In our analysis, we also obtain several results\nrelated to the Poincar\\'{e}-Dulac theorem and diagonalization of the Carleman\nmatrix, which could be of independent interest."}

Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words\neven when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper\ninvestigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this\nresilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct\nwriting systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing,\nrecombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli\nfor models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on\nclean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations,\nfrequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs.

The results show that transverse electron motion\nin a chiral environment, captured by OAM dynamics, gives rise to strong orbital\nselectivity that reverses upon inversion of the handedness of the chiral\npotential. This behavior originates from a coupling between the electron's\nlinear and orbital angular momenta, leading to effects that are significantly\nstronger than those arising from spin-phonon and bare spin-orbit interactions\nunder realistic physical conditions. Moreover, the CIOS effect is shown to\nincrease with the length of the chiral region and remains robust against static\ndisorder. The orbital selectivity can give rise to spin selectivity when\ninitial correlations exist between spin and OAM states.

Parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reduces local computing\nand memory overhead, making it attractive for federated learning. However,\nexisting federated LoRA methods typically assume uniform rank configurations\nand unimodal inputs, overlooking two key real-world challenges: (1)\nheterogeneous client resources have different LoRA ranks, and (2) multimodal\ndata settings with potentially missing modalities. In this work, we propose\nFediLoRA, a simple yet effective framework for federated multimodal fine-tuning\nunder heterogeneous LoRA ranks and missing modalities. FediLoRA introduces a\ndimension-wise aggregation strategy that reweights LoRA updates without\ninformation dilution during aggregation. It also includes a lightweight\nlayer-wise model editing method that selectively incorporates global parameters\nto repair local components which improves both client and global model\nperformances. Experimental results on three multimodal benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that FediLoRA achieves superior performance over competitive\nbaselines in both global and personalized settings, particularly in the\npresence of modality incompleteness."}

In existing\nstudies, only a limited number of ETMPC methods have attempted to address\neither state delays or actuator saturation, and even these few methods\ntypically lack co-design optimization between adaptive event-triggering\nmechanisms and the control law. To overcome these limitations, this paper\npresents a Lyapunov-Krasovskii-based adaptive ETMPC strategy that enables the\nco-design optimization of both the triggering mechanism and the controller.\nSpecifically, the event-triggering parameter matrix is adaptively optimized by\nembedding an internal adaptive variable within the Lyapunov-Krasovskii-like\nfunction. Furthermore, the actuator saturation nonlinearity is transformed into\na convex hull representation. The infinite-horizon robust optimization problem\nis reformulated as a convex optimization problem with linear matrix inequality\n(LMI) constraints.

Its\ndysregulation is associated with a wide range of conditions, from\ncardiovascular disease to anxiety disorders. Skin nerve activity (SKNA)\nextracted from high-frequency electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings provides a\nnoninvasive window into SNS dynamics, but its measurement is highly susceptible\nto electromyographic (EMG) contamination. Traditional preprocessing based on\nbandpass filtering within a fixed range (e.g., 500--1000 Hz) is susceptible to\noverlapping EMG and SKNA spectral components, especially during sustained\nmuscle activity. We present a denoising approach using a lightweight\none-dimensional convolutional autoencoder with a long short-term memory (LSTM)\nbottleneck to reconstruct clean SKNA from EMG-contaminated recordings.

Simply\nincreasing the volume of data does not guarantee performance improvements,\nwhile preprocessing, sampling, and validation require substantial time and\ncost.\n  To address this issue, a variety of data selection methods have been\nproposed.

These\nbinary normalized layers can be of any type, such as fully connected,\nconvolutional, attention, etc., and they consist of slight variations of the\ncorresponding conventional layers. To show the effectiveness of the binary\nnormalized layers, two different models are configured to solve a multiclass\nimage classification problem and a language decoder to predict the next token\nof a sequence. The model to solve the image classification has convolutional\nand fully connected layers, and the language model is composed of transformer\nblocks with multi-head attention. The results show that models with binary\nnormalized layers present almost the same results obtained by equivalent models\nwith real 32-bit parameters.

At the architectural level,\nOmniMap employs a tightly coupled 3DGS-Voxel hybrid representation that\ncombines fine-grained modeling with structural stability. At the implementation\nlevel, OmniMap identifies key challenges across different modalities and\nintroduces several innovations: adaptive camera modeling for motion blur and\nexposure compensation, hybrid incremental representation with normal\nconstraints, and probabilistic fusion for robust instance-level understanding.\nExtensive experiments show OmniMap's superior performance in rendering\nfidelity, geometric accuracy, and zero-shot semantic segmentation compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods across diverse scenes. The framework's versatility is\nfurther evidenced through a variety of downstream applications, including\nmulti-domain scene Q&A, interactive editing, perception-guided manipulation,\nand map-assisted navigation."}

One of the most\npopular techniques to qualify the SOTs is the switching angle shift, where the\napplied direct current was assumed to shift, via domain wall depinning during\nthe anti-domain expansion, the switching angle of a perpendicular magnetization\nin a linear proportion manner under a large rotating magnetic field. Here, we\nreport that, for the most commonly employed perpendicular magnetization\nheterostructures in spintronics (e.g., those based on FeCoB, Co, and Co/Ni\nmultilayers), the switching angle shift considerably misestimates the SOT\nwithin the domain wall depinning analysis of the slope of the linear-in-current\nscaling and may also have a non-zero residual value at zero direct current. Our\nexperiments and simulations unveil that the switching angle shift is most\nlikely dominated by the chiral asymmetric nucleation rather than the expansion\nof the anti-domains. The in-plane field from external magnet and\ncurrent-induced SOTs lower the perpendicular nucleation field and thus the\nrequired switching angle, ultimately leading to underestimation of the SOTs by\nthe domain wall depinning analysis.

A common\napproach in many of these contexts has been to consider simplified approaches\nbased on the Born and Markov approximations. While these approximations are\nindeed often appropriate in contexts such as quantum optics, the widespread\napplication of these approximations has been driven more by simplicity than by\naccuracy. In particular, these Markovian treatments will fail in many cases,\nsuch as when coupling to the environment is not weak, when the environment is\nstructured and has resonances, when the system couples to low-frequency modes\nof the environment, or when the questions of interest involve the propagation\nof information through the environment. Despite the fact that many real\nproblems are non-Markovian, the Markov approximation is still widely used, as\nit is often assumed that a fully non-Markovian treatment is too complex to be\npractical. In this perspective we discuss a recently developed set of\ntechniques that address this challenge. Centering our discussion around the\nnotion of the process tensor, we demonstrate that the generality of the process\ntensor concept, coupled with efficient tensor-network methods, opens the door\nto the description of a wide range of observable non-Markovian processes in a\nwide range of open quantum systems."}

Text prompts can add clinical context, but directly applying weakly\nlocalized text-image cues (e.g., CAM/CLIP-derived signals) tends to produce\ncoarse, blob-like responses that smear boundaries unless additional mechanisms\nrecover fine edges. Methods: We propose XBusNet, a novel dual-prompt,\ndual-branch multimodal model that combines image features with clinically\ngrounded text. A global pathway based on a CLIP Vision Transformer encodes\nwhole-image semantics conditioned on lesion size and location, while a local\nU-Net pathway emphasizes precise boundaries and is modulated by prompts that\ndescribe shape, margin, and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)\nterms. Prompts are assembled automatically from structured metadata, requiring\nno manual clicks. We evaluate on the Breast Lesions USG (BLU) dataset using\nfive-fold cross-validation. Primary metrics are Dice and Intersection over\nUnion (IoU); we also conduct size-stratified analyses and ablations to assess\nthe roles of the global and local paths and the text-driven modulation.\nResults: XBusNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on BLU, with mean Dice\nof 0.8765 and IoU of 0.8149, outperforming six strong baselines.

With only 27 GPU-hours,\npost-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on\nGenEval (0.73$\\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\\rightarrow$88.15), while\nalso boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit\n6.94$\\rightarrow$7.25).

Yet performance on contact-rich,\ndeformable-object, and long-horizon tasks plateau far below perfect execution,\neven with thousands of expert demonstrations. This is due to the inefficiency\nof existing ``expert'' data collection procedures based on human teleoperation.\nTo address this issue, we introduce RaC, a new phase of training on\nhuman-in-the-loop rollouts after imitation learning pre-training. In RaC, we\nfine-tune a robotic policy on human intervention trajectories that illustrate\nrecovery and correction behaviors. Specifically, during a policy rollout, human\noperators intervene when failure appears imminent, first rewinding the robot\nback to a familiar, in-distribution state and then providing a corrective\nsegment that completes the current sub-task. Training on this data composition\nexpands the robotic skill repertoire to include retry and adaptation behaviors,\nwhich we show are crucial for boosting both efficiency and robustness on\nlong-horizon tasks. Across three real-world bimanual control tasks: shirt\nhanging, airtight container lid sealing, takeout box packing, and a simulated\nassembly task, RaC outperforms the prior state-of-the-art using 10$\\times$ less\ndata collection time and samples.

However, the translation by small open\nmodels remains an open problem. We contribute to this ongoing research by\nintroducing TINYFABULIST TRANSLATION FRAMEWORK (TF2), a unified framework for\ndataset creation, fine tuning, and evaluation in English-Romanian literary\ntranslations, centred on the creation and open release of both a compact, fine\ntuned language model (TF2-12B) and large scale synthetic parallel datasets\n(DS-TF2-EN-RO-3M and DS-TF2-EN-RO-15K). Building on DS-TF1-EN-3M (TF1), the\nlargest collection of synthetic English fables to date, we address the need for\nrich, high quality literary datasets in low resource languages such as\nRomanian. Our pipeline first generates 15k high quality Romanian references\nfrom the TF1 pool using a high performing LLM. We then apply a two stage fine\ntuning process to a 12B parameter open weight model: (i) instruction tuning to\ncapture genre specific narrative style, and (ii) adapter compression for\nefficient deployment. Evaluation combines corpus level BLEU and a five\ndimension LLM based rubric (accuracy, fluency, coherence, style, cultural\nadaptation) to provide a nuanced assessment of translation quality. Results\nshow that our fine tuned model achieves fluency and adequacy competitive with\ntop performing large proprietary models, while being open, accessible, and\nsignificantly more cost effective. Alongside the fine tuned model and both\ndatasets, we publicly release all scripts and evaluation prompts. TF2 thus\nprovides an end-to-end, reproducible pipeline for research on cost efficient\ntranslation, cross lingual narrative generation, and the broad adoption of open\nmodels for culturally significant literary content in low resource settings."}

A common\napproach in many of these contexts has been to consider simplified approaches\nbased on the Born and Markov approximations. While these approximations are\nindeed often appropriate in contexts such as quantum optics, the widespread\napplication of these approximations has been driven more by simplicity than by\naccuracy. In particular, these Markovian treatments will fail in many cases,\nsuch as when coupling to the environment is not weak, when the environment is\nstructured and has resonances, when the system couples to low-frequency modes\nof the environment, or when the questions of interest involve the propagation\nof information through the environment.

While numerous studies have explored\nrebalancing techniques to address this issue, less attention has been given to\nevaluating the performance of binary classifiers under imbalance when no such\ntechniques are applied. Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the\nperformance of binary classifiers \"as-is\", without performing any explicit\nrebalancing. Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a\ndiverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic\ndatasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and\nfew-shot scenarios as baselines. Our approach also explores varying data\ncomplexities through synthetic decision boundary generation to simulate\nreal-world conditions. In addition to standard classifiers, we include\nexperiments using undersampling, oversampling strategies, and one-class\nclassification (OCC) methods to examine their behavior under severe imbalance.\nThe results confirm that classification becomes more difficult as data\ncomplexity increases and the minority class size decreases. While traditional\nclassifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN\nand boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better\ngeneralization compared to traditional classifiers. Visual interpretability and\nevaluation metrics further validate these findings. Our work offers valuable\nguidance on model selection for imbalanced learning, providing insights into\nclassifier robustness without dependence on explicit rebalancing techniques."}

Inspired by this, we\ndesign an Object-level Correlation Network (OCNet) by establishing the\nobject-level correlation between the support target object and query general\nobjects, which is mainly composed of the General Object Mining Module (GOMM)\nand Correlation Construction Module (CCM). Specifically, GOMM constructs the\nquery general object feature by learning saliency and high-level similarity\ncues, where the general objects include the irrelevant background objects and\nthe target foreground object. Then, CCM establishes the object-level\ncorrelation by allocating the target prototypes to match the general object\nfeature. The generated object-level correlation can mine the query target\nfeature and suppress the hard pixel noise for the final prediction. Extensive\nexperiments on PASCAL-${5}^{i}$ and COCO-${20}^{i}$ show that our model\nachieves the state-of-the-art performance."}

GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code\nsimilarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen\nreal-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and\ninterpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious\ncorrelations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.\nCounterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite\nlabels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a\nLarge Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples\nwith opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the\ncrucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring\nspurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more\nrobust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to\n97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group\naccuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20\nvulnerability.

We evaluated GCond on self-supervised learning\ntasks using MobileNetV3-Small and ConvNeXt architectures on the ImageNet 1K\ndataset and a combined head and neck CT scan dataset, comparing the proposed\nmethod against baseline linear combinations and state-of-the-art gradient\nconflict resolution methods. The stochastic mode of GCond achieved a two-fold\ncomputational speedup while maintaining optimization quality, and demonstrated\nsuperior performance across all evaluated metrics, achieving lower L1 and SSIM\nlosses compared to other methods on both datasets. GCond exhibited high\nscalability, being successfully applied to both compact models\n(MobileNetV3-Small) and large architectures (ConvNeXt-tiny and ConvNeXt-Base).\nIt also showed compatibility with modern optimizers such as AdamW and\nLion/LARS. Therefore, GCond offers a scalable and efficient solution to the\nproblem of gradient conflicts in multi-task learning."}

In this paper, we propose SBS, a\nparameter-efficient enhancement to neural representation for neural networks\nthat suppresses spectral bias using two techniques: (1) a unidirectional\nordering-based smoothing that improves kernel smoothness in the output space,\nand (2) unidirectional ordering-based smoothing aware random fourier features\nthat adaptively modulate the frequency bandwidth of input encodings based on\nlayer-wise parameter count. Extensive evaluations on various ResNet models with\ndatasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, demonstrate that SBS achieves\nsignificantly better reconstruction accuracy with less parameters compared to\nSOTA."}

Recently, researchers have explored using\nLLMs for GPU kernel generation, though prior work has largely focused on\ntranslating high-level PyTorch modules into CUDA code.

This is often accompanied by catastrophic\nforgetting, where models lose previously acquired skills. While various methods\nhave been proposed, the choice and function of the divergence term have been\nsurprisingly unexamined as a proactive solution. We argue that standard RLVR\nobjectives -- both those using the mode-seeking reverse KL-divergence and those\nforgoing a divergence term entirely -- lack a crucial mechanism for knowledge\nretention. The reverse-KL actively accelerates this decay by narrowing the\npolicy, while its absence provides no safeguard against the model drifting from\nits diverse knowledge base. We propose a fundamental shift in perspective:\nusing the divergence term itself as the solution. Our framework,\nDiversity-Preserving Hybrid RL (DPH-RL), leverages mass-covering f-divergences\n(like forward-KL and JS-divergence) to function as a rehearsal mechanism. By\ncontinuously referencing the initial policy, this approach forces the model to\nmaintain broad solution coverage. Extensive experiments on math and SQL\ngeneration demonstrate that DPH-RL not only resolves the Pass@k degradation but\nimproves both Pass@1 and Pass@k in- and out-of-domain. Additionally, DPH-RL is\nmore training-efficient because it computes f-divergence using generator\nfunctions, requiring only sampling from the initial policy and no online\nreference model.

Research on adversarial attacks not only reveals model\nvulnerabilities but also provides critical insights for enhancing robustness.\nAlthough current mixing-based strategies have been proposed to increase the\ntransferability of adversarial examples, they either perform global blending or\ndirectly exchange a region in the images, which may destroy global semantic\nfeatures and mislead the optimization of adversarial examples. Furthermore,\ntheir reliance on cross-entropy loss for perturbation optimization leads to\ngradient diminishing during iterative updates, compromising adversarial example\nquality. To address these limitations, we focus on non-targeted attacks and\npropose a novel framework via local mixing and logits optimization. First, we\npresent a local mixing strategy to generate diverse yet semantically consistent\ninputs.

Recurrence rates of stroke are between 5 and\n25% in the first year. As mortality rates for relapses are extraordinarily high\n(40%) it is of utmost importance to reduce the recurrence rates. We address\nthis issue by detecting patients at risk of stroke recurrence at an early stage\nin order to enable appropriate therapy planning. To this end we collected 3D\nintracranial CTA image data and recorded concomitant heart diseases, the age\nand the gender of stroke patients between 2010 and 2024. We trained single- and\nmultimodal deep learning based neural networks for binary relapse detection\n(Task 1) and for relapse free survival (RFS) time prediction together with a\nsubsequent classification (Task 2). The separation of relapse from non-relapse\npatients (Task 1) could be solved with tabular data (AUC on test dataset:\n0.84).
