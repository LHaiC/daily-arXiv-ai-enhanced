For\nthis reason, a static k-d tree is often built from all of the k-dimensional\ndata en masse.

This article describes insertion and deletion algorithms\nfor a dynamic k-d tree, and measures their performance."}

Few\nother results, mostly on \\textsc{Longest Path} and some generalizations of\n\\textsc{Matching Cut}, have also been developed. However, little success has\nbeen seen in enumeration versions of \\textsc{Vertex Cover} and \\textsc{Feedback\nVertex Set}, some of the most studied problems in kernelization. In this paper,\nwe address this shortcoming. Our first result is a polynomial-delay enumeration\nkernel with $2k$ vertices for \\textsc{Enum Vertex Cover}, where we wish to list\nall solutions with at most $k$ vertices. This is obtained by developing a\nnon-trivial lifting algorithm for the classical crown decomposition reduction\nrule, and directly improves upon the kernel with $\\mathcal{O}(k^2)$ vertices\nderived from the work of Creignou et al. Our other result is a polynomial-delay\nenumeration kernel with $\\mathcal{O}(k^3)$ vertices and edges for \\textsc{Enum\nFeedback Vertex Set}; the proof is inspired by some ideas of Thomass\\'e [TALG,\n2010], but with a weaker bound on the kernel size due to difficulties in\napplying the $q$-expansion technique."}

The standard approach for encoding\noptimization problems on quantum processing units (QPUs) involves transforming\nthem into their Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)\nrepresentation.

Because the hose operates continuously, it only has to\ndeliver about 50 gallons/minute (little more than a garden hose). The flux from\na single hose is not sufficient to stop global warming by itself, but is enough\nto test the effect of the aerosols, and, once replicated to about 20 sites\nacross the planet, can offset all the warming caused by atmospheric CO$_2$.\n  Two varieties of hose are presented here, one delivering H$_2$S as a liquid\nand the other as a gas. Pumping liquid H$_2$S through a narrow 20 km hose\nrequires high pressure, which can be handled by strong and lightweight hose\nwalls or by placing intermediate pumps along the hose.

These learning methods build on a dynamic\nprogramming solution to plan a sequence of sampling locations. We evaluate our\napproaches against existing heuristic methods for dynamic targeting, showing\nthe benefits of using learning for this application. Imitation learning\nperforms on average 10.0\\% better than the best heuristic method, while\nreinforcement learning performs on average 13.7\\% better.

We demonstrate that cloning quantum states is, in-fact, equivalent to\ncloning the trash-and-replace channel and therefore the former is a special\ncase of the more general problem. By appealing to higher-order quantum\noperations (quantum processes) we construct a unified framework to deal with\nthe most general cloning tasks and establish necessary conditions for a family\nof channels to exhibit super-replication -- a quadratic cloning rate with\nvanishing error. We find that noisy phase-gate channels satisfy these\nconditions, and we construct the explicit super-replicating process for the\ntask. Conversely, we find that the criteria are not met by the full set of\nnoisy unitary gates; classical noise channels; or amplitude damping channels,\nwhose respective cloning rates are at most linear. In this paradigm, we not\nonly derive new results, but also refigure known ones. We derive a strong\nconverse for state cloning, and for unitary channels we construct an\nalternative super-replication process to that of D\\\"ur et al.

While previous research has examined factors\ndriving overall engagement, less is known about why certain tweets receive\nunexpectedly high levels of one type of engagement relative to others. Drawing\non Signaling Theory and Attention Economy Theory, we investigate these\nunexpected engagement patterns on Twitter (now known as \"X\"), developing an\n\"unexpectedness quotient\" to quantify deviations from predicted engagement\nlevels. Our analysis of over 600,000 tweets reveals distinct patterns in how\ncontent characteristics influence unexpected engagement. News, politics, and\nbusiness tweets receive more retweets and comments than expected, suggesting\nusers prioritize sharing and discussing informational content. In contrast,\ngames and sports-related topics garner unexpected likes and comments,\nindicating higher emotional investment in these domains. The relationship\nbetween content attributes and engagement types follows clear patterns:\nsubjective tweets attract more likes while objective tweets receive more\nretweets, and longer, complex tweets with URLs unexpectedly receive more\nretweets. These findings demonstrate how users employ different engagement\ntypes as signals of varying strength based on content characteristics, and how\ncertain content types more effectively compete for attention in the social\nmedia ecosystem. Our results offer valuable insights for content creators\noptimizing engagement strategies, platform designers facilitating meaningful\ninteractions, and researchers studying online social behavior."}

In\naddition, two movement modes of FAs are considered, namely, free movement mode\nand zonal movement mode, for which different optimization techniques are\napplied, respectively. Numerical results show that, the proposed FA schemes\nboost security by exploiting additional spatial DoF rather than transmit power,\nwhile AN provides remarkable gains under high transmit power.

To accommodate such nonuniform\nmotion constraints, we build upon our earlier work and extend the use of Mobius\ntransformation to a multi-agent framework. The Mobius transformation maps two\nnonconcentric circles to concentric ones, thereby converting spatially\nnonuniform constraints into uniform ones in the transformed plane. Leveraging\nthis property, we introduce the notion of a phase-shifted order parameter,\nalong with the associated concepts of Mobius phase-shift coupled\nsynchronization and balancing, which characterize the phase-coordinated\npatterns studied in this paper. We establish an equivalence between the\nunicycle dynamics in the original and transformed planes under the Mobius\ntransformation and its inverse, and show that synchronization is preserved\nacross both planes, whereas balancing is generally not. Distributed control\nlaws are then designed in the transformed plane using barrier Lyapunov\nfunctions, under the assumption of an undirected and connected communication\ntopology among agents. These controllers are subsequently mapped back to the\noriginal plane to obtain the linear acceleration and turn-rate control inputs\napplied to the actual agents.

These states arise\nfrom diameter-dependent competition between the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic\n($J_1$) and longer-range antiferromagnetic ($J_2$/$J_3$) couplings, as\nrigorously validated through density-functional theory calculations and\nHeisenberg modeling of phase diagrams. Critically, by the\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we find that high-order vortex configurations\nunlock an intrinsic hybridization mechanism governed by strict orbital angular\nmomentum (OAM) selection rules ($\\Delta l = \\pm 2(n-1)$) -- a process strictly\nforbidden in fundamental vortices ($n$ = 1) -- generating complex high-OAM\nmagnons with measurable topological charge. This is vividly demonstrated in the\n3$\\varphi$ state, where hybridization between $l$ = -4, 0 and 4 modes produces\neight-petal magnon density patterns. Such states provide an essential\nplatform-free solution for generating high-OAM magnons, wchich is crucial for\nspin-wave-based information transport.

While some recent works have explored the use of VLMs in social\nrobot navigation, no existing work systematically evaluates their ability to\nmeet these necessary conditions.

Such variation can introduce systematic\nbiases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type\nI, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors. We call this LLM hacking.\n  We quantify the risk of LLM hacking by replicating 37 data annotation tasks\nfrom 21 published social science research studies with 18 different models.\nAnalyzing 13 million LLM labels, we test 2,361 realistic hypotheses to measure\nhow plausible researcher choices affect statistical conclusions.

Our\napproach utilizes a wrist-centric frame for view-invariant shape analysis and a\nfacial-centric frame for context-aware trajectory modeling. These streams are\nprocessed by specialized networks-a topology-aware graph convolution for shape\nand a Finsler geometry-based encoder for trajectory-and are integrated via a\ngeometry-driven optimal transport fusion mechanism. DSLNet sets a new\nstate-of-the-art, achieving 93.70%, 89.97% and 99.79% accuracy on the\nchallenging WLASL-100, WLASL-300 and LSA64 datasets, respectively, with\nsignificantly fewer parameters than competing models."}

To address the risk of exposing sensitive data through local models,\nsecure aggregation via secure multiparty computation has been proposed to\nenhance privacy. At the same time, perfect privacy can only be achieved by a\nuniform distribution of the masked local models to be aggregated. This raises a\nproblem when working with real valued data, as there is no measure on the reals\nthat is invariant under the masking operation, and hence information leakage is\nbound to occur.

While algorithms like Fast Marching Tree\n(FMT$^{*}$) offer asymptotically optimal solutions in static settings, their\nsingle-pass design prevents path revisions which are essential for real-time\nadaptation. On the other hand, full replanning is often too computationally\nexpensive. This paper introduces FMT$^{x}$, an extension of the Fast Marching\nTree algorithm that enables efficient and consistent replanning in dynamic\nenvironments. We revisit the neighbor selection rule of FMT$^{*}$ and\ndemonstrate that a minimal change overcomes its single-pass limitation,\nenabling the algorithm to update cost-to-come values upon discovering better\nconnections without sacrificing asymptotic optimality or computational\nefficiency. By maintaining a cost-ordered priority queue and applying a\nselective update condition that uses an expanding neighbor to identify and\ntrigger the re-evaluation of any node with a potentially suboptimal path,\nFMT$^{x}$ ensures that suboptimal routes are efficiently repaired as the\nenvironment evolves. This targeted strategy preserves the inherent efficiency\nof FMT$^{*}$ while enabling robust adaptation to changes in obstacle\nconfiguration. FMT$^{x}$ is proven to recover an asymptotically optimal\nsolution after environmental changes. Experimental results demonstrate that\nFMT$^{x}$ outperforms the influential replanner RRT$^{x}$, reacting more\nswiftly to dynamic events with lower computational overhead and thus offering a\nmore effective solution for real-time robotic navigation in unpredictable\nworlds."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to\ntrain LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL. The\nframework features a modular and decoupled architecture, ensuring high\nflexibility and extensibility. It encompasses a wide variety of real-world\nscenarios, and supports mainstream RL algorithms. Furthermore, we propose\nScalingInter-RL, a training approach designed for exploration-exploitation\nbalance and stable RL optimization. In early stages, it emphasizes exploitation\nby restricting the number of interactions, and gradually shifts towards\nexploration with larger horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving\nstrategies. In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less\nprone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to\nvalidate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and\nthe ScalingInter-RL approach. Our agents match or surpass commercial models on\n27 tasks across diverse environments.

Our\napproach encodes complex quantum network dynamics, including entanglement\ndegradation and time-varying channel noise, into a low-dimensional feature\nspace, enabling efficient belief updates and scalable policy learning. The core\nof our framework is a hybrid GNN-POMDP architecture that processes\ngraph-structured representations of entangled links to learn routing policies,\ncoupled with a noise-adaptive mechanism that fuses POMDP belief updates with\nGNN outputs for robust decision making. We provide a theoretical analysis\nestablishing guarantees for belief convergence, policy improvement, and\nrobustness to noise. Experiments on simulated quantum networks with up to 100\nnodes demonstrate significant improvements in routing fidelity and entanglement\ndelivery rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines, particularly under high\ndecoherence and nonstationary conditions."}

In this work, we present a\nnovel RGB-only, object-level topometric navigation pipeline that enables\nzero-shot, long-horizon robot navigation without requiring 3D maps or\npre-trained controllers. Our approach integrates global topological path\nplanning with local metric trajectory control, allowing the robot to navigate\ntowards object-level sub-goals while avoiding obstacles. We address key\nlimitations of previous methods by continuously predicting local trajectory\nusing monocular depth and traversability estimation, and incorporating an\nauto-switching mechanism that falls back to a baseline controller when\nnecessary. The system operates using foundational models, ensuring open-set\napplicability without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our method in both simulated environments and real-world\ntests, highlighting its robustness and deployability. Our approach outperforms\nexisting state-of-the-art methods, offering a more adaptable and effective\nsolution for visual navigation in open-set environments.

Such variation can introduce systematic\nbiases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type\nI, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors. We call this LLM hacking.\n  We quantify the risk of LLM hacking by replicating 37 data annotation tasks\nfrom 21 published social science research studies with 18 different models.\nAnalyzing 13 million LLM labels, we test 2,361 realistic hypotheses to measure\nhow plausible researcher choices affect statistical conclusions.
