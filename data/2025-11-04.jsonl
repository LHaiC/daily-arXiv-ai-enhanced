To address this gap, we propose\nDuoGLM, a training-free dual-perspective framework for structure-aware graph\nreasoning.

The global perspective\nperforms topology-to-role inference to generate functional descriptions of\nstructural positions.

Recent approaches apply large\nlanguage models to graphs by linearizing structures into token sequences\nthrough random walks. These methods create concise graph vocabularies to\nreplace verbose natural language descriptions. However, they overlook a\ncritical component that makes language expressive: grammar. In natural\nlanguage, grammar assigns syntactic roles to words and defines their functions\nwithin sentences. Similarly, nodes in graphs play distinct structural roles as\nhubs, bridges, or peripheral members. Current graph language methods provide\ntokens without grammatical annotations to indicate these structural or semantic\nroles. This absence limits language models' ability to reason about graph\ntopology effectively. We propose \\textbf{G2rammar}, a bilingual grammar\nframework that explicitly encodes both structural and semantic grammar for\ntext-attributed graphs. Structural grammar characterizes topological roles\nthrough centrality and neighborhood patterns. Semantic grammar captures content\nrelationships through textual informativity. The framework implements two-stage\nlearning with structural grammar pre-training followed by semantic grammar\nfine-tuning.

In the backward pass, the same map propagates\nadjoint variables from the current frame back to the initial frame to compute\ngradients. This shared long-range map allows the accuracy of gradient\ncomputation to benefit directly from improvements in flow map construction.\nBuilding on this insight, we introduce a novel adjoint solver that solves the\nadjoint equations directly on the flow map, enabling long-range and accurate\ndifferentiation of incompressible flows without differentiating intermediate\nnumerical steps or storing intermediate variables, as required in conventional\nadjoint methods.

Due to the limited overload capability of IBR,\ntheir Short-Circuit Current (SCC) contribution is much smaller than that of\nSGs, which may result in protection devices failing to trip during faults.\nConsequently, the remaining SGs play a key role in offering sufficient SCC\nvolumes.

Recently\nuncrossed flows have played a key role in approximation algorithms for maximum\ndisjoint paths in fully-planar instances, where the combined supply plus demand\ngraph is planar. In the fully-planar case, any fractional multiflow can be\nconverted into one that is uncrossed, which is then exploited to find a good\nrounding of the fractional solution. We investigate finding an uncrossed\nmultiflow as a standalone algorithmic problem in general planar instances (not\nnecessarily fully-planar). We consider both a congestion model where the given\ndemands must all be routed, and a maximization model where the goal is to pack\nas much flow in the supply graph as possible (not necessarily equitably).\n  For the congestion model, we show that determining if an instance has an\nuncrossed (fractional) multiflow is NP-hard, but the problem of finding an\nintegral uncrossed flow is polytime solvable if the demands span a bounded\nnumber of faces.

Such alterations are ubiquitous in nature, and\nincluding them in the synthesis process is crucial for generating realistic\ntextures. We introduce a novel approach for creating textures with such\nblemishes, adopting a learning-based approach that leverages unlabeled\nexamples. Our approach does not require manual annotations by the user;\ninstead, it detects the appearance-altering features through unsupervised\nanomaly detection. The various textural features are then automatically\nclustered into semantically coherent groups, which are used to guide the\nconditional generation of images. Our pipeline as a whole goes from a small\nimage collection to a versatile generative model that enables the user to\ninteractively create and paint features on textures of arbitrary size.

Second, we devise a\nrank-aware batch orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) method for achieving\nlow-latency sparse channel recovery. To handle abrupt rank changes caused by\nuser mobility, we establish a discrete-time autoregressive (AR) model that\nleverages the temporal rank correlation between continuous-time instances to\nobtain a complete observation matrix capable of perceiving rank changes for\nmore accurate channel estimates. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness\nof the proposed channel estimation frame and demonstrate that our algorithms\nachieve state-of-the-art performance in low-rank matrix recovery with\ntheoretical guarantees."}

Here, we uncover a simple yet unifying\nshifted power law that robustly characterizes the stochasticity of both\nhuman-driven vehicle (HV) and AV behaviors, especially in the long-tail regime.\nThe model adopts a parsimonious analytical form with only one or two\nparameters, enabling efficient calibration even under data sparsity. Analyzing\nlarge-scale, micro-level trajectory data from global HV and AV datasets, the\nshifted power law achieves an average R2 of 0.97 and a nearly identical tail\ndistribution, uniformly fits both frequent behaviors and rare safety-critical\ndeviations, significantly outperforming existing Gaussian-based baselines. When\nintegrated into an agent-based traffic simulator, it enables forward-rolling\nsimulations that reproduce realistic crash patterns for both HVs and AVs,\nachieving rates consistent with real-world statistics and improving the\nfidelity of safety assessment without post hoc correction.

The amplitudes of PES corrugations\non the order of 0.4 and 0.03 $\\mu$eV per atom of one layer, respectively, are\nobtained. The account of structural relaxation doubles this value for the (2,1)\npattern, while causing only minimal changes for the (3,1) pattern. We show that\ndifferent from aligned graphene layers, for moir\\'e patterns, PES minima and\nmaxima can switch their positions upon changing the interlayer distance. The\nPES shape is closely described by the first spatial Fourier harmonics both with\nand without account of structural relaxation. A barrier for relative rotation\nof the layers to an incommensurate state that can make superlubricity robust is\nestimated based on the approximated PES. We also derive a set of measurable\nphysical properties related to interlayer interaction including shear mode\nfrequency, shear modulus and static friction force.

To overcome this challenge, we propose the Deep\nKoopman-boosted Dual-branch Diffusion Policy (D3P) algorithm. D3P introduces a\ndual-branch architecture to decouple the roles of different sensory modality\ncombinations. The visual branch encodes the visual observations to indicate\ntask progression, while the fused branch integrates both visual and\nproprioceptive inputs for precise manipulation.

In\nimplementing the approach, firstly, different same damage-level measurements\nare used as inputs, while the model is forced to converge conditionally to two\ndifferent damage states. Secondly, the process is repeated for a different\ngroup of measurements. Finally, the convergence scores are compared to identify\nwhich one belongs to a different damage state. The process for both\nhealthy-to-healthy and damage-to-healthy input data creates, simultaneously,\nmeasurements for digital twinning purposes at different damage states, capable\nof pattern recognition and machine learning data generation. Further to this\nprocess, a support vector machine classifier and a principal component analysis\nprocedure is developed to assess the generated and real measurements of each\ndamage category, serving as a secondary new dynamics learning indicator in\ndamage scenarios. Importantly, the approach is shown to capture accurately\ndamage over healthy measurements, providing a powerful tool for vibration-based\nsystem-level monitoring and scalable infrastructure resilience."}

Our\nfindings reveal distinct reorientational behaviors and establish a clear\ncorrelation between molecular reorientation and Raman spectral features in\npolyanion-based solid electrolytes. AIMD simulations show that NO2- rotates\neasily in Na3ONO2, while its rotational dynamics are hindered in NaNO2. Raman\nspectroscopy confirms these results, with temperature-dependent shifts in the\ninternal vibrational modes of the polyanion. In Na3ONO2, the full width at half\nmaximum (FWHM) of these modes increases with temperature, while NaNO2 exhibits\na constant FWHM until a significant jump at the ordered-disordered phase\ntransition.

However,\npath planning for these robots in unknown environments presents a significant\nchallenge, requiring a delicate balance between efficient exploration and\nrobust planning. Traditional path planners, which treat the environment as a\ngeometric grid, often suffer from redundant searches and are prone to failure\nin complex scenarios due to their lack of semantic understanding. To overcome\nthese limitations, we reframe path planning in unknown environments as a\nsemantic reasoning task. We introduce a Semantic Agent for Tensegrity robots\n(SATPlanner) driven by a Large Language Model (LLM). SATPlanner leverages\nhigh-level environmental comprehension to generate efficient and reliable\nplanning strategies.At the core of SATPlanner is an Adaptive Observation Window\nmechanism, inspired by the \"fast\" and \"slow\" thinking paradigms of LLMs. This\nmechanism dynamically adjusts the perceptual field of the agent: it narrows for\nrapid traversal of open spaces and expands to reason about complex obstacle\nconfigurations. This allows the agent to construct a semantic belief of the\nenvironment, enabling the search space to grow only linearly with the path\nlength (O(L)) while maintaining path quality. We extensively evaluate\nSATPlanner in 1,000 simulation trials, where it achieves a 100% success rate,\noutperforming other real-time planning algorithms.

This transformation from concave\nto convex is initiated by changes in turgor pressure and the release of stored\nelastic energy from prestresses in the concave state, which accelerate this\nmovement, leading to inversion of the lobes bi-axial curvature.

The floor plan offers\nexplicit global guidance, while the depth features provide implicit geometric\ncues, collectively enabling precise prediction of optimal navigation directions\nand robust obstacle avoidance. Moreover, GlocDiff introduces noise perturbation\nduring training to enhance robustness against pose estimation errors, and we\nfind that combining this with a relatively stable VO module during inference\nresults in significantly improved navigation performance. Extensive experiments\non the FloNa benchmark demonstrate GlocDiff's efficiency and effectiveness in\nachieving superior navigation performance, and the success of real-world\ndeployments also highlights its potential for widespread practical\napplications."}

This paper explores a training method for\ndomain adaptation to adapt PilotNet, an end-to-end deep learning-based model,\nfor left-hand driving conditions using real-world Australian highway data. Four\ntraining methods were evaluated: (1) a baseline model trained on U.S.\nright-hand driving data, (2) a model trained on flipped U.S. data, (3) a model\npretrained on U.S. data and then fine-tuned on Australian highways, and (4) a\nmodel pretrained on flipped U.S. data and then finetuned on Australian\nhighways. This setup examines whether incorporating flipped data enhances the\nmodel adaptation by providing an initial left-hand driving alignment. The paper\ncompares model performance regarding steering prediction accuracy and\nattention, using saliency-based analysis to measure attention shifts across\nsignificant road regions. Results show that pretraining on flipped data alone\nworsens prediction stability due to misaligned feature representations, but\nsignificantly improves adaptation when followed by fine-tuning, leading to\nlower prediction error and stronger focus on left-side cues. To validate this\napproach across different architectures, the same experiments were done on\nResNet, which confirmed similar adaptation trends. These findings emphasize the\nimportance of preprocessing techniques, such as flipped-data pretraining,\nfollowed by fine-tuning to improve model adaptation with minimal retraining\nrequirements."}

Recently, deep learning models representing\nCLFs have been applied into a learner-verifier framework to identify\nsatisfiable candidates. However, the learner treats Lyapunov conditions as\ncomplex constraints for optimisation, which is hard to achieve global\nconvergence. It is also too complicated to implement these Lyapunov conditions\nfor verification. To improve this framework, we treat Lyapunov conditions as\ninductive biases and design a neural CLF and a CLF-based controller guided by\nthis knowledge. This design enables a stable optimisation process with limited\nconstraints, and allows end-to-end learning of both the CLF and the controller.\nOur approach achieves a higher convergence rate and larger region of attraction\n(ROA) in learning the CLF compared to existing methods among abundant\nexperiment cases. We also thoroughly reveal why the success rate decreases with\nprevious methods during learning."}

While deterministic deep\nnetworks achieve impressive performance under well-constrained conditions, they\nare often overconfident and fail to capture the multi-modality of the\nunderlying pose distribution. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\nprobabilistic framework that leverages flow matching on the SE(3) manifold for\nestimating 6D object pose distributions. Unlike existing methods that regress a\nsingle deterministic output, our approach models the full pose distribution\nwith a sample-based estimate and enables reasoning about uncertainty in\nambiguous cases such as symmetric objects or severe occlusions. We achieve\nstate-of-the-art results on Real275, YCB-V, and LM-O, and demonstrate how our\nsample-based pose estimates can be leveraged in downstream robotic manipulation\ntasks such as active perception for disambiguating uncertain viewpoints or\nguiding grasp synthesis in an uncertainty-aware manner."}

However, most methods\ntreat ego-motion as an auxiliary task, either mixing all motion types or\nexcluding depth-independent rotational motions in supervision. Such designs\nlimit the incorporation of strong geometric constraints, reducing reliability\nand robustness under diverse conditions. This study introduces a discriminative\ntreatment of motion components, leveraging the geometric regularities of their\nrespective rigid flows to benefit both depth and ego-motion estimation. Given\nconsecutive video frames, network outputs first align the optical axes and\nimaging planes of the source and target cameras. Optical flows between frames\nare transformed through these alignments, and deviations are quantified to\nimpose geometric constraints individually on each ego-motion component,\nenabling more targeted refinement. These alignments further reformulate the\njoint learning process into coaxial and coplanar forms, where depth and each\ntranslation component can be mutually derived through closed-form geometric\nrelationships, introducing complementary constraints that improve depth\nrobustness. DiMoDE, a general depth and ego-motion joint learning framework\nincorporating these designs, achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple\npublic datasets and a newly collected diverse real-world dataset, particularly\nunder challenging conditions.

Real stochastic processes\nexhibit a degree of memory effects (correlations in time), long-range\ndependencies, roughness and anomalous diffusion phenomena that are not captured\nin standard diffusion or bridge modeling due to the use of Brownian motion\n(BM). As a remedy, leveraging a recent Markovian approximation of fBM (MA-fBM),\nwe construct FDBM that enable tractable inference while preserving the\nnon-Markovian nature of fBM. We prove the existence of a coupling-preserving\ngenerative diffusion bridge and leverage it for future state prediction from\npaired training data.
